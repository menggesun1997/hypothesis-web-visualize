    "Problem_Statement": "Current continual learning techniques for LLMs lack integration of neurocognitive signals that could offer real-time indicators of model prediction confidence and error, limiting adaptability in breaking knowledge shifts.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of bridging predictive brain theory with scalable learning mechanisms by incorporating event-related potentials (ERP) from neuroscience as feedback signals to guide knowledge updating; exploits hidden bridge between predictive brain and neurocognitive metrics revealed in global GPS analysis.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a continual learning framework where the LLM's outputs are augmented with simulated ERP-inspired confidence signals derived from internal attention and activation patterns. These signals will feed into a meta-controller that dynamically adjusts learning rates and update priorities. We will design a neural module inspired by mental state attribution models that predicts the model's own error likelihood and guides knowledge integration.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets with time-sequenced knowledge updates (e.g., Wikipedia snapshots).\n2) Train baseline continual learning LLMs on these data.\n3) Implement ERP-inspired signal generation module from internal activations.\n4) Train meta-controller using reinforcement learning to optimize update decisions.\n5) Evaluate on knowledge retention, update speed, and prediction accuracy metrics.\n6) Compare with standard continual learning baselines.\n7) Perform ablation testing of ERP signal components.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: New article about COVID-19 vaccine efficacy data update.\nExpected output: Updated knowledge representation incorporating the latest efficacy statistics with confidence scores reflecting adaptive integration.\nEvaluation: Faster and more accurate update than baseline, with meta-controller correctly modulating learning rate to avoid catastrophic forgetting.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If simulated ERP signals do not improve adaptability, revert to direct uncertainty quantification from model probabilities or attention entropy. Alternatively, use externally collected EEG-ERP datasets to pretrain meta-controllers before integration."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that ERP-inspired signals can be reliably simulated from internal attention and activation patterns of LLMs, and that these signals correlate meaningfully with the model's prediction confidence or error likelihood, requires stronger justification. While grounding continual learning in neurocognitive signals is novel, the assumption that analogues of ERP signals can be derived internally without real neural data might be overly optimistic or insufficiently validated. Clarify the theoretical basis or provide preliminary evidence supporting this mapping to ensure the method's foundation is sound and believable before proceeding to complex meta-controller design and reinforcement learning optimization. Potential noise and mismatch in signal simulation versus actual ERP must be explicitly addressed to avoid foundational flaws in the approach's soundness. This is critical since the entire meta-controller control loop depends on trustworthy ERP-inspired signals reflecting model states accurately, otherwise the adaptive learning could be misguided or unstable. Consider including a validation step or ablation identifying correlation between simulated ERP signals and model error/confidence prior to full meta-controller training in your experiment plan to remedy this risk early on, thus enhancing robustness of your approach's core assumption and soundness of mechanism design in Proposed_Method section.  Suggestions on a more explicit evaluator for simulated signals according to neuroscientific criteria may help increase credibility of these crucial assumptions in the neuroadaptive learning framework design to underpin future continual learning performance improvements reliably and meaningfully here, as the problem statement hinges on exploiting real-time brain-inspired signals for model adaptability in knowledge updates.  Without such clarity and validation, the research risks being conceptually interesting but pragmatically fragile or non-generalizable across domains and datasets.  Therefore, the assumption about the ERP signal generation and their meaningful interpretation needs explicit theoretical or empirical substantiation upfront before scaling to full meta-controller learning in continual adaptation experiments. This will also signal to the community the neuro-inspired signal design's translational relevance and avoid speculative leaps in soundness of mechanism reasoning in core method design required for sustained impact later on.  Thus, enhancing clarity and foundational robustness of this assumption is a must prior to full method implementation efforts, to secure trust in subsequent claims of improved continual learning via neuroadaptive feedback loops inspired by ERP metrics from neuroscience, as proposed in your method statement.  It is a prerequisite for eventual feasibility and impact claims tied to persistent lifelong adaptation through brain-guided knowledge updates in LLMs envisioned here. Timely attention to this assumption will strengthen the entire chain of reasoning linking neuroscience-inspired signals and continual learning control mechanisms critically needed for impactful contribution in this highly competitive research area.  Currently, this foundational assumption is the linchpin for soundness and must be improved with explicit evidence, rationale or prior art links to ensure rigorous grounding.  This is the first top-level issue to fix before refining meta-controller designs or downstream experimental evaluations in your plan, and thus a top priority critique to address for credibility, feasibility, and ultimate impact success of the proposal overall at this stage of review.  The section impacted is Proposed_Method, but also Problem_Statement as it states gap in integration of neurocognitive signals, so concrete formulation of these signals with empirical grounding is needed there as well. Â Please revise accordingly to explicitly incorporate these validations or a theoretical framework underpinning ERP signal simulation from internal LLM activations, linking to predictive brain theories as motivation, under the soundness dimension for your method and problem framing specifically."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan needs to explicitly integrate evaluative steps validating the ERP-inspired signal generation independently before moving to complex meta-controller training. Currently, the approach bundles all elements sequentially without interim checks to verify that the simulated neurocognitive signals indeed correlate with model confidence or error rates as hypothesized, which is central to the method's learning adaptation. Adding an explicit early experiment step to measure and quantify the correlation between these signals and meaningful uncertainty indicators on controlled data would greatly improve the plan's feasibility and scientific rigor. This could involve benchmarking simulated ERP signals against known uncertainty proxies or human ERP datasets where available. Moreover, the plan to train the meta-controller using reinforcement learning appears ambitious, yet the criteria for reinforcement signals and success metrics in this stage are not clearly defined. It would help to define clearer rewards and stability checks for the adaptive learning rates and knowledge update modulation. The ablation study step is appropriate but should be extended to dissect how each ERP signal component contributes to continual learning improvements, guiding purposeful refinement or simplification of the neuroadaptive module. Finally, fallback plan details are helpful but could be enhanced by describing how external EEG-ERP pretraining integrates practically into the pipeline with respect to data, alignment, and computational overhead. Overall, introducing intermediate validation and clearer decision checkpoints in the experiment plan will improve the plan's feasibility and reduce risk of failure in later stages, aligning with scientific best practices. Neglecting these may lead to wasted computational efforts and uninformative meta-controller policy learning if foundational signal assumptions don't hold. Clarifying these aspects explicitly in the Experiment_Plan section is essential to solidify feasibility of the proposed neuroadaptive continual learning framework and improve project's scientific and implementation clarity."
