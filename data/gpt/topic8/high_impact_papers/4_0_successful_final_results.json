    "title": "Psychological Cognitive Control-Inspired Ethical Metrics for LLM Moderation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current ethical evaluation and bias detection tools for large language models (LLMs) in social media moderation inadequately reflect human cognitive interpretative processes, limiting their capacity to assess nuanced ethical risks and biases in content handling.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap of lacking integration between clinical communication models and psychological constructs with LLM ethical evaluation metrics, leveraging the hidden bridge identified between psychological cognitive control theories and language model assessment methodologies to develop more human-aligned bias detection.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an ethical evaluation framework inspired by models of human cognitive control (e.g., conflict monitoring, error detection) that simulates interpretive control in LLM outputs. This includes embedding interpretive ambiguity layers in evaluation metrics, assessing how models manage conflicting world knowledge biases, and producing graded ethical risk scores aligned with human decision patterns in content moderation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets of social media posts with annotated ethical concerns and user interpretive ambiguity.\n2. Implement baselines using existing bias evaluation frameworks (e.g., BiasBios, HolisticBias).\n3. Develop a cognitive-control-simulating evaluation module for LLMs.\n4. Fine-tune pretrained LLMs with interpretive control feedback loops.\n5. Evaluate improvements in ethical risk detection accuracy using F1, precision, recall, and human evaluators.\n6. Perform ablation studies contrasting with standard evaluation metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Social media post containing ambiguous cultural references potentially triggering bias.\nExpected Output: Ethical risk score reflecting interpretive ambiguity, with model highlighting conflicting world knowledge and rationalized bias detection akin to human oversight.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cognitive control simulation does not improve ethical metrics, fallback to incorporating explicit psychological annotation layers (e.g., affective state tagging) for bias detection or pivot to hybrid symbolic-LLM methods merging communication model rules with pretrained embeddings."

        "title": "Cognitive Control-Inspired Ethical Evaluation Framework for LLM Moderation Aligned with Global AI Governance",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing ethical evaluation and bias detection tools for large language models (LLLs), particularly in social media moderation, often fail to capture the dynamic, context-sensitive human interpretative and cognitive control processes. This limits their ability to detect nuanced biases and ethical risks, especially under ambiguous or conflicting content, reducing practical alignment with human-like ethical oversight and regulatory expectations.",
        "Motivation": "This research addresses a critical gap where psychological theories of cognitive control have been underutilized in LLM ethical evaluation due to challenges in operationalization and mapping to statistical models. By explicitly grounding our framework in cognitive neuroscience constructs validated in interpretive ambiguity and conflict monitoring, and strategically integrating these within assessment metrics, we advance beyond existing black-box or static bias metrics. Moreover, to achieve impactful novelty and societal relevance—beyond the competitive baseline—our approach integrates these novel ethical metrics with contemporary global AI governance frameworks including the European Artificial Intelligence Act and relevant human rights law principles. This alignment facilitates transparent, human-interpretable risk scoring suitable for regulatory compliance auditing and rights-based content moderation evaluation, thus bridging cognitive science, AI ethics, and legal mandates.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-layered ethical evaluation framework inspired by key components of human cognitive control—specifically conflict monitoring, error detection, and adaptive interpretive control—operationalized via computational analogues tailored to LLM outputs. \n\n1. Conflict Monitoring Analogue: Implement a module quantifying semantic and pragmatic inconsistencies in LLM-generated content by measuring output divergences against multiple world knowledge embeddings and cultural context models;\n\n2. Error Detection Analogue: Integrate uncertainty quantification techniques (e.g., calibrated confidence scores and counterfactual perturbations) to detect ethically salient ambiguities or contradictory signals in content moderation decisions;\n\n3. Adaptive Interpretive Control: Embed feedback-driven interpretive layers that simulate dynamic adjustment of ethical risk scores based on conflict/error signals, mimicking human cognitive control adjustment mechanisms.\n\nWe further incorporate regulatory compliance modules linking these cognitive-inspired risk scores to criteria derived from the Artificial Intelligence Act's risk management and transparency obligations and human rights law benchmarks (e.g., non-discrimination, freedom of expression). This will produce graded, human-interpretable ethical risk assessments that serve both AI governance audit purposes and practical moderator support.\n\nAdditionally, inspired by mental health care frameworks, we design interpretive ambiguity detection to flag potential psychological harms from biased or ambiguous content, augmenting ethical sensitivity.\n\nReferences to key cognitive neuroscience studies on conflict monitoring (e.g., Botvinick et al., 2001), error-related negativity in EEG literature, and recent AI interpretability research justify the soundness of these analogues and their transferability to LLM evaluation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Collection and Annotation Protocol: Curate a large-scale dataset of social media posts annotated for ethical concerns with explicit guidelines operationalizing interpretive ambiguity and conflicting ethical signals. Annotation will involve trained experts using a standardized rubric, with inter-annotator agreement assessed via Cohen's Kappa aiming for >0.75 to ensure reliability.\n\n2. Baseline Establishment: Evaluate posts using existing bias and ethical evaluation frameworks (e.g., HolisticBias, BiasBios) to establish competitive performance benchmarks.\n\n3. Development of Cognitive-Control-Inspired Modules: Implement computational analogues of conflict monitoring, error detection, and adaptive interpretive control within an evaluation pipeline.\n\n4. Feedback Loop Mechanism for Fine-tuning:\n   a. Generate interpretive control feedback signals from conflict/error modules;\n   b. Represent these as structured, continuous feedback vectors encoding degrees of conflict and ambiguity;\n   c. Fine-tune pretrained LLMs using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) techniques to internalize interpretive control patterns, employing reward models trained on annotated datasets.\n\n5. Human Evaluation Design: Recruit qualified human evaluators representing diverse cultural backgrounds to assess the ethical risk scores and interpretability of model outputs in a blinded manner. Establish human benchmarks via consensus rating sessions and evaluate model-human agreement using statistical correlation metrics.\n\n6. Regulatory Integration Testing: Validate the framework's utility by mapping outputs to AI Act compliance checklists and human rights impact assessments.\n\n7. Ablation Studies: Compare performance and interpretability with and without cognitive-control modules and regulation-alignment layers.\n\n8. Scalability and Reproducibility: Release annotated dataset, codebase, and detailed protocols to facilitate community validation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A social media post uses culturally ambiguous language with potential gender and ethnic bias, combined with conflicting information from multiple cultural references.\n\nExpected Output: \n- Ethical risk score reflecting high interpretive ambiguity and conflict monitoring alerts.\n- Highlighting of conflicting world knowledge elements triggering uncertainty signals.\n- Rationalized explanation aligning with human moderator-style reasoning referencing legal rights (e.g., non-discrimination obligations per human rights law).\n- Compliance flags indicating necessity for increased transparency or content restriction under the Artificial Intelligence Act provisions.\n\nThis output aims to demonstrate layered detection of subtle biases, transparent interpretive control simulation, and direct translation to governance-relevant metrics.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct cognitive control simulation modules fail to provide improved or interpretable ethical risk assessments, we will pivot to enriching the evaluation framework with explicit psychological annotation layers such as affective state tagging, vulnerability risk indicators, or mental health harm potentials. Concurrently, we will explore hybrid symbolic-LLM systems that embed communication model rules and legal principles as symbolic constraints interfaced with pretrained embedding spaces to retain interpretability and legal compliance traceability. We will also investigate multi-armed bandit algorithms to optimize interpretive feedback collection and annotation efficiency."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that psychological cognitive control theories can be directly and effectively simulated within LLM evaluation metrics requires stronger theoretical and empirical justification. Cognitive control in humans involves dynamic, context-sensitive control processes that may not straightforwardly map to computational bias detection or ethical assessment in LLMs. Clarify how the cognitive control constructs will be operationalized in a way that preserves their interpretative richness, and why this approach is expected to surpass existing evaluation metrics in capturing ethical nuances and ambiguity detection reliably. Address potential mismatches between psychological models (often grounded in human cognitive architectures) and the statistical nature of LLMs to strengthen soundness of the methodological foundations. This will also help differentiate the contribution in a highly competitive area with many existing approaches combining psychology and AI evaluation frameworks, thereby tackling the NOV-COMPETITIVE assessment more robustly. \n\nSuggested action: Provide concrete mappings or computational analogues for key cognitive control components (e.g., conflict monitoring) and explain how these interact with LLM outputs to yield more nuanced ethical scores, with references to relevant cognitive neuroscience or psychology studies that validate such transferability in similar contexts.\n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"

Specifically, the plan to fine-tune pretrained LLMs with interpretive control feedback loops requires clarification on how such feedback will be generated, represented, and integrated—especially given that cognitive control is not a standard supervision signal in NLP fine-tuning.\n\nAdditionally, the collection and annotation of social media posts with user interpretive ambiguity is non-trivial: guidance on annotation protocols, inter-annotator agreement, and scalability of data collection should be elaborated. Similarly, the evaluation step involving human evaluators needs clearer design, including how human benchmarks will be established for comparison.\n\nSuggested action: Provide a more granular protocol for feedback loop construction, data annotation methodology, and human evaluation design, addressing how these can be pragmatically realized in a controlled experimental setting to ensure reproducibility and meaningful results.\n\nTarget section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
