        "title": "Policy-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Encyclopedic Knowledge Encoding in LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) currently encode world knowledge statically, lacking mechanisms to dynamically adapt encyclopedic knowledge in accordance with evolving policies and regulations. This limits their effectiveness and compliance in open-domain question answering, especially in sensitive domains.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap identified between 'practical robots' and 'policy' via reinforcement learning to enhance dynamic adaptation, and the internal gap of tightly coupling organizational transformation, policy making, and LLM deployment. This novelty lies in embedding policy-awareness into knowledge updates within LLMs via reinforcement learning.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a framework wherein LLMs incorporate an adaptive reinforcement learning (RL) module that interacts with a policy knowledge base. The RL agent continuously evaluates updates in policy and ethical standards, guiding the LLM’s semantic encoding layers to update or revise entries about encyclopedic knowledge accordingly. The system integrates imitation learning from expert annotators to bootstrap the alignment of knowledge with policy. The architecture comprises three components: (1) a policy parser that encodes regulatory documents into machine-readable constraints; (2) an RL agent interfacing between policy signals and the LLM’s knowledge layers; (3) an adaptive knowledge encoder that modifies semantic embeddings dynamically respecting policy constraints.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use datasets of encyclopedic knowledge (e.g., Wikidata) augmented with contemporaneous policy documents (e.g., GDPR, AI ethics). 2. Employ a large pre-trained LLM baseline (e.g., GPT-4) and integrate the RL policy agent. 3. Compare static vs. dynamic encoding on open-domain QA benchmarks with evolving policies (e.g., time-sliced QA datasets). 4. Evaluate compliance with ethical standards using newly defined policy adherence metrics. 5. Conduct ablation studies on the influence of imitation learning bootstrapping. 6. User study with domain experts validating policy adherence in QA output.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'What data privacy rights do EU citizens have under current regulations?'\nExpected Output: An accurate, policy-compliant answer referring to GDPR stipulations, reflecting the latest updates from policy input.\n\nInput: 'Has any policy changed regarding AI-generated content copyright?'\nExpected Output: Reflect recent amendments incorporated dynamically via RL adaptation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If RL integration proves unstable, fallback to a supervised fine-tuning approach with policy-labeled datasets to simulate policy-awareness. Alternatively, add a post-processing filter module that adjusts LLM outputs based on policy constraints. Conduct error analysis to detect misalignment and incorporate feedback loops manually."

        "title": "Human-Robot Collaboration Inspired Transparency Framework for Semantic Encoding in LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Semantic encoding of encyclopedic knowledge in LLMs is often opaque, limiting trust and usability in human-AI collaborative open-domain question answering scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the external gap between 'practical robots' and 'digital transformation' via socio-technical frameworks and interpretability research, addressing internal limitations around transparency and trust in LLMs’ encyclopedic knowledge representations.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a socio-technical framework integrating human-in-the-loop interaction into LLM semantic encoding. The method uses explainable AI (XAI) techniques to visualize and modulate the semantic knowledge layers interacting in real time with users. Inspired by human-robot collaboration interfaces, it enables users to query, correct, or augment the LLM’s world knowledge encoding interactively, promoting transparency and co-adaptation. The system architecture pairs an LLM with an XAI module exposing knowledge attribution and semantic pathways, alongside a user interface for feedback and knowledge refinement.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop a prototype integrating explainability tools (like attention visualization) with a base LLM. 2. Recruit human participants to perform open-domain QA tasks requiring complex knowledge queries. 3. Measure transparency, trust, and answer accuracy compared to non-interactive baselines. 4. Analyze how user feedback modifies semantic encoding and improves performance. 5. Evaluate system usability with standard socio-technical assessment scales. 6. Test scenarios include multi-turn QA and corrections of hallucinated facts.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User asks, 'Explain the role of photosynthesis in the carbon cycle.'\nSystem provides transparent attention heatmaps showing contributing facts.\nUser identifies a knowledge gap and inputs correction: 'Include recent findings on oceanic carbon absorption.'\nSystem adapts semantic encoding accordingly, improving subsequent QA responses.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time human intervention slows system responsiveness, develop offline batch human feedback loops. Alternatively, improve interpretability via intrinsic model designs (e.g., modular semantic layers) reducing dependency on interactive interfaces."

        "title": "Governance Modeling for Ethical Deployment of LLM-based Encyclopedic QA Systems",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM-powered open-domain QA systems lack comprehensive governance models to guide their ethical, legal, and bias management, posing risks for societal harm and misapplications.",
        "Motivation": "Fulfills the external gap connecting 'policy' and 'digital transformation' in healthcare and service management domains and addresses internal limitations surrounding ethical, legal, and bias concerns in foundational literature by developing governance frameworks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create a multi-layered governance modeling framework combining policy evaluation methodologies with organizational digital transformation principles to oversee LLM-powered encyclopedic QA deployments. The framework includes dynamic bias detection and mitigation tools, ethical compliance auditing modules, and stakeholder engagement protocols. It integrates with deployment pipelines providing real-time governance feedback and adaptive controls for model outputs based on domain-specific regulations and societal norms.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop governance framework components tailored to healthcare and public service QA applications. 2. Test on LLM QA systems answering domain-specific questions with ethical sensitivity concerns. 3. Use established bias and fairness benchmarks to evaluate efficacy. 4. Convene policy experts and user groups to validate governance protocols. 5. Measure impact on reducing harmful biases and increasing stakeholder trust. 6. Iterate governance rules adapting to novel policy updates.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Can I use this medical information to diagnose myself?'\nOutput: Governance module triggers ethical safeguards, providing disclaimers and recommending consulting professionals.\nBias mitigation example: QA outputs corrected for demographic bias detected by bias audit submodules.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If automated governance tools miss critical issues, incorporate human oversight layers and policy expert in-the-loop review. Develop iterative feedback mechanisms to improve model governance over time."

        "title": "Cross-Modal Semantic Knowledge Transfer Inspired by Human-Robot Collaboration for LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLMs primarily learn encyclopedic knowledge from text but lack mechanisms to incorporate dynamic, multimodal knowledge arising from human-robot interaction and environmental sensing relevant to question answering.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the 'practical robots'–'digital transformation' hidden bridge, this addresses the external gap on biological and organizational adoption challenges by enabling robust multimodal semantic encoding in LLMs through human-robot collaboration insights.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multimodal knowledge fusion framework where LLMs learn to integrate textual encyclopedic knowledge with sensory and interaction data from robots engaging in human collaboration scenarios. Use a dual-stream encoder architecture where sensor-based embeddings and textual embeddings align semantically, enhanced by a human corrective feedback loop. This enables LLMs to semantically contextualize world knowledge with embodied experience, improving answer relevance and groundedness.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multimodal datasets combining robot interaction logs, sensor data, and parallel textual encyclopedic content. 2. Pre-train dual encoder models mapping modalities into aligned semantic spaces. 3. Fine-tune an LLM using these embeddings integrated in its knowledge layers. 4. Evaluate on multimodal open-domain QA benchmarks and human evaluation for grounding. 5. Compare to text-only LLM baselines for improvements in accuracy and contextual relevance.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Describe how a robot assembles a bicycle and relate to mechanical parts knowledge.'\nOutput: Detailed explanation synthesizing textual mechanical facts with observed robot assembly experiences for richer, grounded response.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal fusion is noisy or unaligned, simplify modalities to visual plus text or use transfer learning from one primary modality. Employ contrastive learning to improve semantic alignment robustness."

        "title": "Adaptive Knowledge Distillation Incorporating Policy Constraints for Sustainable LLM QA Systems",
        "Problem_Statement": "Distilling large encyclopedic knowledge into smaller efficient LLMs for open-domain QA often loses critical contextual and policy-aligned information, risking inaccurate or non-compliant responses.",
        "Motivation": "This idea bridges the internal gaps about failure modes and emergent capabilities of foundational models with the external gap linking policy and digital transformation, innovating an adaptive distillation process embedding policy constraints intrinsically.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a policy-aware knowledge distillation framework where the teacher LLM’s output is filtered and weighted by policy compliance modules during the student model training. The distillation loss is augmented with policy adherence constraints, resulting in a compressed student model that retains both encyclopedic coverage and dynamic policy constraints. The framework uses reinforcement signals from policy modules to adaptively focus on sensitive knowledge areas during distillation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use large teacher LLM trained on encyclopedic data annotated with policy constraints. 2. Train student models of varying sizes with adaptive policy-weighted distillation losses. 3. Evaluate on standard open-domain QA benchmarks with policy-sensitive questions. 4. Measure compliance, accuracy, and generalization compared to conventional distillation. 5. Perform robustness tests against policy changes and out-of-distribution questions.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'What are the licensing considerations for AI-generated music?'\nOutput: Student model answers reflecting licensing policy nuances retained from teacher’s policy-aware knowledge encoding.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive weighting destabilizes training, try curriculum learning where simpler policy-aligned knowledge is distilled first, progressively adding complexity. Alternatively, separate policy and encyclopedic heads in student models."
