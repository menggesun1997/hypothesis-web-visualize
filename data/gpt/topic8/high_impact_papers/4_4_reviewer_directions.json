    "title": "Embedding Clinical Communication Frameworks into LLM Training for Bias Propagation Mitigation",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs propagate biases encoded in world knowledge without mechanisms to recognize or moderate clinically-informed communication nuances intrinsic to social media context moderation.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses foundational internal gaps by integrating clinical communication principles (turn-taking, empathy, clarity) into LLM training regimes, creating models aware of communication ethics and bias impact on user wellbeing in social media environments.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-objective training paradigm combining standard language modeling with auxiliary losses encoding clinical communication behaviors. Auxiliary tasks include empathy scoring, clarity enforcement, bias flagging based on clinical annotations, and discourse act recognition. These enable LLMs to internalize communication ethics reducing biased propagation in moderation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Compile clinically-annotated communication datasets aligned with social media use-cases.\n2. Define auxiliary objectives operationalizing empathy, clarity, and ethical communication.\n3. Train LLMs with joint optimization on language generation and auxiliary tasks.\n4. Evaluate on benchmark bias datasets and communication quality metrics.\n5. Conduct moderation task experiments testing bias reduction and user impact.\n6. Compare with vanilla LLMs.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Social media post with implicit microaggression.\nExpected Output: Moderation output recognizes subtle bias and applies clinical communication informed rationale suggesting moderated response that preserves clarity and empathy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If auxiliary objectives conflict with language modeling, fallback to post-processing bias filters inspired by clinical communication or employ reinforcement learning from human feedback specialized in clinical communication ethics."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines sensible stages but lacks concrete details on dataset suitability, scale, and annotation reliability for the clinically-annotated communication datasets. To ensure feasibility, specify: which existing datasets or how new datasets will be compiled, criteria for clinical annotation quality, and anticipated challenges in aligning these with social media contexts. Additionally, clarify how auxiliary objectives like empathy scoring will be operationalized quantitatively and integrated during joint training without adverse interference. This will strengthen the practical execution roadmap and enable reproducibility assessments early on, increasing confidence in feasibility and experimental rigor, especially given potential conflicts between objectives noted in the fallback plan (e.g., auxiliary loss conflicts). Without these, the experiment plan remains high-level and risks underestimating complexity or resource requirements in implementing clinical communication-informed training at scale for LLMs targeting bias mitigation and moderation tasks in social media contexts. Addressing this will enhance the robustness and credibility of the proposed method's validation process in practice, an essential step for progressing this idea feasibly toward impact realization in operational environments like AI-based chatbots and ethical moderation systems relevant to computational social science and IT ethics domains. Target more defined milestones and measurable criteria before proceeding to large-scale joint training and deployment stages, as current pipeline risks difficulty in iterative debugging and evaluation due to insufficient specificity on auxiliary data and objective design elements involved in bias and communication ethics modeling within the multi-objective paradigm proposed here. This advice aims to improve the refinement and operational clarity of the experiment protocol, critical for a high-stakes application area integrating clinical communication with advanced ML models for socially sensitive use cases. Please revise the experiment plan accordingly with explicit, data- and method-specific elaborations to ensure practical and technical feasibility of your approach at the intended scale and complexity given the novelty and interdisciplinary challenge inherent in your motivating problem statement and method conception context.
