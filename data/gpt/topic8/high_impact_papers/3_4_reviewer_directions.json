    "title": "Mental State Attribution Module for Continual Knowledge Error Estimation in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs lack internal mechanisms for mental state attribution to estimate prediction uncertainty or error during knowledge updating, limiting efficient adaptation in continual learning.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the internal bridge gap identified between predictive brain theory and practical learning mechanisms by developing a model component that mimics mental state attribution, enabling the LLM to self-assess knowledge correctness and guide learning dynamically.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a dedicated neural module trained to predict the 'mental state' of the model regarding its confidence or uncertainty for each prediction or updated fact, based on contextual embeddings and history. This module's outputs inform a dynamic update scheduler controlling which knowledge gets emphasized or down-weighted during continual learning cycles.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Define uncertainty proxies for training the mental state attribution module.\n2) Train LLM with integrated mental state module on sequentially evolving datasets.\n3) Compare update efficiency and forgetting with and without mental state attribution.\n4) Evaluate on benchmarks requiring rapid adaptation with minimal memory disruption.\n5) Perform sensitivity analyses on module prediction thresholds.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: New geopolitical event with ambiguous information.\nExpected output: Mental state module assigns low confidence leading to cautious incremental updates or request for confirmation, preventing premature knowledge corruption.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If trained mental state attribution is unreliable, fallback to uncertainty estimation via Monte Carlo dropout or ensemble disagreement as proxy signals."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed 'mental state attribution' module conceptually aims to mimic human-like self-assessment of confidence or uncertainty, which is promising. However, the mechanism by which this module integrates with the LLM's core predicting components and how it reliably produces meaningful mental state signals is not clearly detailed. The explanation lacks clarity on architectural specifics, training signals, and how contextual embeddings and history are fused to generate robust uncertainty estimates, beyond simplistic proxies. A more explicit mechanistic design and theoretical grounding are necessary to evaluate soundness and practical performance expectations reliably. Please provide architectural diagrams, formal definitions of input/output interactions, and a rationale for why this approach can outperform standard uncertainty estimation baselines beyond fallback methods like MC dropout or ensemble disagreement, to strengthen the methodâ€™s credibility and novelty in this competitive area."

          "feedback_content": "While the step-by-step experiment plan covers key evaluation aspects like efficiency, forgetting, and adaptation benchmarks, it lacks detail on dataset selection and the definition of uncertainty proxies critical for training the mental state module. The plan assumes availability of 'sequentially evolving datasets' and 'uncertainty proxies' but does not specify what these are, their domain relevance, or metrics for measuring update efficacy and forgetting quantitatively. Furthermore, the plan does not clarify how the dynamic update scheduler will be validated independently of the mental state module outputs. Including precise benchmark datasets tailored for continual learning (e.g., knowledge updating in dynamic knowledge bases or time-sensitive corpora), clear operationalization of uncertainty proxies (e.g., calibration error, prediction entropy), and detailed evaluation metrics would increase experimental feasibility and reproducibility. Also, consider including ablation studies identifying contributions of individual components."
