    "title": "Psychological Cognitive Control-Inspired Ethical Metrics for LLM Moderation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current ethical evaluation and bias detection tools for large language models (LLMs) in social media moderation inadequately reflect human cognitive interpretative processes, limiting their capacity to assess nuanced ethical risks and biases in content handling.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap of lacking integration between clinical communication models and psychological constructs with LLM ethical evaluation metrics, leveraging the hidden bridge identified between psychological cognitive control theories and language model assessment methodologies to develop more human-aligned bias detection.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an ethical evaluation framework inspired by models of human cognitive control (e.g., conflict monitoring, error detection) that simulates interpretive control in LLM outputs. This includes embedding interpretive ambiguity layers in evaluation metrics, assessing how models manage conflicting world knowledge biases, and producing graded ethical risk scores aligned with human decision patterns in content moderation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets of social media posts with annotated ethical concerns and user interpretive ambiguity.\n2. Implement baselines using existing bias evaluation frameworks (e.g., BiasBios, HolisticBias).\n3. Develop a cognitive-control-simulating evaluation module for LLMs.\n4. Fine-tune pretrained LLMs with interpretive control feedback loops.\n5. Evaluate improvements in ethical risk detection accuracy using F1, precision, recall, and human evaluators.\n6. Perform ablation studies contrasting with standard evaluation metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Social media post containing ambiguous cultural references potentially triggering bias.\nExpected Output: Ethical risk score reflecting interpretive ambiguity, with model highlighting conflicting world knowledge and rationalized bias detection akin to human oversight.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cognitive control simulation does not improve ethical metrics, fallback to incorporating explicit psychological annotation layers (e.g., affective state tagging) for bias detection or pivot to hybrid symbolic-LLM methods merging communication model rules with pretrained embeddings."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that psychological cognitive control theories can be directly and effectively simulated within LLM evaluation metrics requires stronger theoretical and empirical justification. Cognitive control in humans involves dynamic, context-sensitive control processes that may not straightforwardly map to computational bias detection or ethical assessment in LLMs. Clarify how the cognitive control constructs will be operationalized in a way that preserves their interpretative richness, and why this approach is expected to surpass existing evaluation metrics in capturing ethical nuances and ambiguity detection reliably. Address potential mismatches between psychological models (often grounded in human cognitive architectures) and the statistical nature of LLMs to strengthen soundness of the methodological foundations. This will also help differentiate the contribution in a highly competitive area with many existing approaches combining psychology and AI evaluation frameworks, thereby tackling the NOV-COMPETITIVE assessment more robustly. \n\nSuggested action: Provide concrete mappings or computational analogues for key cognitive control components (e.g., conflict monitoring) and explain how these interact with LLM outputs to yield more nuanced ethical scores, with references to relevant cognitive neuroscience or psychology studies that validate such transferability in similar contexts.\n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"

Specifically, the plan to fine-tune pretrained LLMs with interpretive control feedback loops requires clarification on how such feedback will be generated, represented, and integratedâ€”especially given that cognitive control is not a standard supervision signal in NLP fine-tuning.\n\nAdditionally, the collection and annotation of social media posts with user interpretive ambiguity is non-trivial: guidance on annotation protocols, inter-annotator agreement, and scalability of data collection should be elaborated. Similarly, the evaluation step involving human evaluators needs clearer design, including how human benchmarks will be established for comparison.\n\nSuggested action: Provide a more granular protocol for feedback loop construction, data annotation methodology, and human evaluation design, addressing how these can be pragmatically realized in a controlled experimental setting to ensure reproducibility and meaningful results.\n\nTarget section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "To strengthen novelty and impact beyond the competitive baseline, consider integrating the proposed framework with globally-relevant regulatory and societal domains, such as the 'Artificial Intelligence Act' or 'Digital Services Act.' For example, formulate how your cognitive-control-inspired ethical metrics could directly aid compliance auditing or risk assessment under these legal frameworks, potentially providing metrics interpretable for regulatory enforcement or transparency standards.\n\nAlternatively, bridging with 'human rights law' concepts could broaden ethical scope and societal relevance, ensuring the evaluation framework accounts for rights-based perspectives on bias and content moderation. This could markedly increase impact by aligning technical evaluation with evolving global AI governance contexts and legal duties.\n\nSuggested action: Explicitly incorporate these globally-linked concepts as use-case scenarios or evaluation criteria in your experiments to both elevate the research's practical relevance and differentiate it from existing work in a crowded field.\n\nTarget section: Motivation"
