        "title": "Neuropsychological Benchmarking for Continual Learning in LLMs: An Interdisciplinary, Globally-Informed Framework",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current continual learning techniques in large language models (LLMs) lack robust, human-inspired validation frameworks that are empirically grounded, globally representative, and operationally reproducible. This limits their adaptability, interpretability, and real-world trustworthiness, especially under diverse cognitive stressors reflective of human neurocognitive variability.",
        "Motivation": "This proposal addresses critical gaps by uniquely bridging cognitive predictive paradigms, rigorously validated neuropsychological assessment methods, and globally diverse biomedical collaboration to produce an innovative benchmarking suite for LLM continual learning. By integrating neuropsychological performance validity tests used in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) studies with expertise and clinical data from institutions such as the University Clinics of Kinshasa and incorporating neurocognitive nutritional effects via the International Union of Nutritional Sciences, the project advances novel, empirically grounded, and culturally-inclusive benchmarks. These benchmarks will meaningfully assess LLMs' adaptive knowledge updating and resilience, surpassing current evaluation standards through richer, multimodal, and societally impactful validation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a benchmarking suite for continual learning algorithms inspired by neuropsychological performance validity tests and informed by real-world clinical data from partner institutions (e.g., University Clinics of Kinshasa) and neurocognitive factors like nutrition (via International Union of Nutritional Sciences datasets). The method entails: (1) collaborative curation of neuropsychological task protocols with clinical experts early in the process, emphasizing selection criteria that map cognitive constructs (e.g., memory retention, attention, inhibition) into computationally measurable components for LLMs; (2) translation of these protocols into synthetic, multimodal dataset challenges incorporating input perturbations, context shifts, and stressors modeled on clinical patterns; (3) empirical validation of these mappings through pilot studies aligning LLM performance metrics with clinical and nutritional data variability; (4) iterative refinement incorporating expert feedback and cross-institutional data; and (5) release of an extensible, reproducible benchmarking platform that allows continuous integration of new clinical insights and demographic diversity, thus ensuring scientific rigor, practical applicability, and broad external validity.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Establish interdisciplinary collaboration with neuropsychologists, clinicians from the University Clinics of Kinshasa, and nutrition scientists from the International Union of Nutritional Sciences to jointly curate a comprehensive set of neuropsychological task protocols, emphasizing diverse cultural and nutritional contexts.\n2) Develop explicit selection criteria mapping cognitive functions tested (e.g., memory, attention under stress) to specific measurable capabilities in LLMs (e.g., knowledge retention, predictive fluency) via cognitive-computational analogies.\n3) Translate curated protocols into synthetic datasets embedding neuropsychological stressors and perturbations, guided by clinical data patterns (e.g., cognitive load variations observed in patients); design these datasets to be multimodal where applicable.\n4) Conduct pilot experiments implementing baseline continual learning algorithms (e.g., Elastic Weight Consolidation, replay-based) on developed benchmarks; empirically correlate model metrics (consistency, adaptation speed, robustness) with clinical and nutritional data insights to validate task-to-metric mapping.\n5) Collect iterative feedback from clinical and nutrition experts during all steps, including dataset curation, translation, and pilot evaluation, ensuring clinical meaningfulness and practical computability.\n6) Assess resource requirements (expertise for annotation, computation for model training, clinical data integration) and document protocols for reproducibility.\n7) Refine and finalize the benchmark suite, incorporating empirical results and expanding to diverse patient data from international collaborators, releasing an open-access platform with clear documentation and extensibility provisions.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A progressive sequence simulating varied context shifts reflecting working memory load and distraction modeled on neuropsychological tasks from patient studies in Kinshasa, infused with nutritional status effects influencing cognitive performance.\nOutput: The LLM should update its internal knowledge robustly, avoiding catastrophic forgetting while maintaining consistent reasoning fluency under perturbed conditions.\nExample: Input: \"Facts about historical events X and Y, now contradictory new info on Y introduced alongside simulated mild cognitive distraction.\" Expected Output: Updated, coherent knowledge on event Y integrated with undisturbed knowledge about event X, demonstrating resilient predictive coherence and incremental adaptation that mirrors neuropsychological patterns observed clinically, validated with expert alignment.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the neuropsychologically inspired benchmarks fail to effectively discriminate continual learning model performance or cannot be operationalized due to translation complexity, pivot to developing a hybrid evaluation framework integrating synthetic challenges with simulated neurocognitive signal modeling (e.g., computational EEG pattern generation informed by clinical data) to enrich evaluation capacity. Alternatively, implement real-world user feedback loops in interactive continual learning scenarios with human-in-the-loop assessment frameworks to iteratively refine benchmark relevance and adaptability, ensuring practical validation despite initial translational challenges."

To enhance feasibility, the plan should detail the translation process, including criteria for selecting task elements that map to measurable LLM capabilities and methods to validate these mappings empirically. Furthermore, integrating clinical expert feedback early in the dataset curation step (not just in refinement) would improve relevance and scientific rigor, ensuring benchmarks are clinically meaningful and practically implementable for machine evaluation. Explicit consideration of resource requirements, such as expertise, computation, and annotation, would also strengthen feasibility assessment for this innovative interdisciplinary approach.  Targeting these areas will help the authors concretize and operationalize their experimental framework, moving beyond high-level concepts toward a reproducible and impactful evaluation suite.

This could enable access to diverse clinical data or expertise to validate and enrich neuropsychological benchmarks with real-world patient data reflecting varied cultural and contextual neurocognitive patterns, thus broadening the empirical grounding and generalizability of the benchmarks. Similarly, alignment with institutions like the International Union of Nutritional Sciences could extend the benchmarks to span neurocognitive aspects affected by nutrition, introducing unique multimodal evaluation dimensions. Such cross-disciplinary integration not only diversifies data sources but also enhances societal impact by addressing equity and external validity challenges in continual learning evaluation on LLMs. The authors should consider forming partnerships or including publicly available datasets from these organizations to operationalize this ambition.
