    "title": "Policy-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Encyclopedic Knowledge Encoding in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) currently encode world knowledge statically, lacking mechanisms to dynamically adapt encyclopedic knowledge in accordance with evolving policies and regulations. This limits their effectiveness and compliance in open-domain question answering, especially in sensitive domains.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap identified between 'practical robots' and 'policy' via reinforcement learning to enhance dynamic adaptation, and the internal gap of tightly coupling organizational transformation, policy making, and LLM deployment. This novelty lies in embedding policy-awareness into knowledge updates within LLMs via reinforcement learning.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a framework wherein LLMs incorporate an adaptive reinforcement learning (RL) module that interacts with a policy knowledge base. The RL agent continuously evaluates updates in policy and ethical standards, guiding the LLM’s semantic encoding layers to update or revise entries about encyclopedic knowledge accordingly. The system integrates imitation learning from expert annotators to bootstrap the alignment of knowledge with policy. The architecture comprises three components: (1) a policy parser that encodes regulatory documents into machine-readable constraints; (2) an RL agent interfacing between policy signals and the LLM’s knowledge layers; (3) an adaptive knowledge encoder that modifies semantic embeddings dynamically respecting policy constraints.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use datasets of encyclopedic knowledge (e.g., Wikidata) augmented with contemporaneous policy documents (e.g., GDPR, AI ethics). 2. Employ a large pre-trained LLM baseline (e.g., GPT-4) and integrate the RL policy agent. 3. Compare static vs. dynamic encoding on open-domain QA benchmarks with evolving policies (e.g., time-sliced QA datasets). 4. Evaluate compliance with ethical standards using newly defined policy adherence metrics. 5. Conduct ablation studies on the influence of imitation learning bootstrapping. 6. User study with domain experts validating policy adherence in QA output.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'What data privacy rights do EU citizens have under current regulations?'\nExpected Output: An accurate, policy-compliant answer referring to GDPR stipulations, reflecting the latest updates from policy input.\n\nInput: 'Has any policy changed regarding AI-generated content copyright?'\nExpected Output: Reflect recent amendments incorporated dynamically via RL adaptation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If RL integration proves unstable, fallback to a supervised fine-tuning approach with policy-labeled datasets to simulate policy-awareness. Alternatively, add a post-processing filter module that adjusts LLM outputs based on policy constraints. Conduct error analysis to detect misalignment and incorporate feedback loops manually."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method introduces an RL agent to dynamically update encyclopedic knowledge in LLMs based on policy changes, but the detailed mechanism of how the RL agent interacts with high-dimensional semantic embeddings and updates them in a stable, interpretable way is not clearly elaborated. Crucial aspects such as reward function design, state/action space definitions, and how policy constraints concretely influence learning and embedding modifications need explicit clarification. Without these, the foundational soundness and reproducibility of the method remain weak. Strengthening this section with formalism or preliminary algorithmic outlines is essential to validate the technical feasibility and novelty of the approach, avoiding ambiguity in implementation and evaluation stages. Please provide a clearer and more rigorous description of the RL mechanism and its integration with LLM semantic encoding layers in the Proposed_Method section to enhance soundness and clarity of the core technical contribution.  Also consider detailing how the imitation learning component bootstraps and complements the RL training to improve stability and policy compliance in knowledge updates, as this interplay is critical yet under-specified currently.  This is the foundation for evaluating the effectiveness of the entire framework and must be robustly addressed first before proceeding to experiments and impact claims.  "

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan suggests evaluation on evolving policy-compliance benchmarks and ablations, but it lacks important operational details that challenge feasibility. Key missing points include: how the dynamic policy parser will be kept up to date with real-world policy changes, the scale and frequency of policy document updates, and how realistic time-sliced QA datasets reflecting evolving encyclopedic knowledge with policies will be constructed or sourced. Additionally, metrics for assessing ethical compliance are described vaguely without concrete formulation or references to existing benchmark standards. The proposed user study is a strong element but needs a more precise description of domain expert recruitment, evaluation criteria, and quantitative/qualitative analysis plans. Without addressing these feasibility gaps—particularly the logistics of continuous policy integration and meaningful evaluation of RL adaptation—the experimental plan risks being infeasible or too loosely defined. Please revise the experiment section to clarify data sourcing & update mechanisms, evaluation metrics with baselines, and concrete experimental protocols ensuring scientific rigor and practical executability of the system validation. This will help ensure that the proposed method can be robustly tested in a reproducible fashion, therefore increasing overall research impact and trustworthiness."
