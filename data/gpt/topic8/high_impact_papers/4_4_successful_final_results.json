        "title": "Embedding Clinical Communication Frameworks into LLM Training for Bias Propagation Mitigation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) propagate biases encoded in their training data and world knowledge, lacking explicit mechanisms to recognize or moderate clinically-informed communication nuances essential to ethical and effective social media moderation. This shortfall risks perpetuating subtle microaggressions and biased interactions online, undermining user wellbeing and trust.",
        "Motivation": "Despite advances in bias mitigation for LLMs, existing approaches rarely integrate clinically-grounded communication principles such as empathy, turn-taking, and clarity, which are critical for nuanced social media moderation. Embedding these principles directly within LLM training addresses a fundamental gap in AI-driven moderation models by aligning technical bias reduction with established communication ethics from clinical domains. This intersection leverages insights from computational social science and IT ethics, creating an AI framework that not only identifies bias but also moderates responses in a socially responsible, empathetic manner beyond current competitive methods.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-objective training paradigm that integrates standard language modeling with auxiliary objectives derived from clinical communication frameworks, operationalized quantitatively for scalable training. Specifically, we incorporate: (1) Empathy scoring based on validated behavioral markers mapped to neural attention distributions; (2) Clarity enforcement via sentence-level readability and coherence metrics; (3) Bias flagging informed by clinically annotated social media datasets targeting subtle microaggressions; and (4) Discourse act recognition emphasizing appropriate turn-taking and perspective-taking behaviors. These auxiliary tasks are designed to synergize using a carefully weighted joint loss, guided by principles from IT ethics and operationalized through differential priority scheduling to mitigate training interference. The method integrates advances in AI-based chatbot ethical frameworks to facilitate real-time moderated responses reflecting clinical communication standards. This approach differentiates itself by embedding clinically-relevant communication ethics directly into model internals rather than post-hoc filtering, providing a novel ethical landscape for bias-aware LLM moderation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset Compilation and Annotation:\n   - Utilize and extend existing datasets such as the EmpatheticDialogues and Bias in Language datasets, supplemented by social media posts from platforms with public APIs (e.g., Reddit, Twitter) filtered for sensitive content.\n   - Collaborate with clinical psychologists and communication experts to annotate ~50,000 posts for empathy, clarity, bias presence (subtle and overt microaggressions), and discourse acts.\n   - Develop inter-annotator agreement protocols, targeting Cohen’s kappa > 0.75 for annotation reliability.\n2. Auxiliary Objective Operationalization:\n   - Define quantitative metrics for empathy (e.g., prosocial language features), clarity (readability scores, e.g. Flesch-Kincaid), bias flags (clinically-informed lexicons and classifiers), and discourse acts (using state-of-the-art discourse parsers).\n   - Design a composite auxiliary loss where each component includes uncertainty-based weighting to reduce negative transfer.\n3. Model Training Procedure:\n   - Pre-train or fine-tune an existing LLM (e.g., GPT-based) on joint objectives.\n   - Employ differential learning rates and gradient surgery techniques to alleviate objective conflicts.\n4. Evaluation Metrics:\n   - Benchmark on established bias detection datasets (e.g., StereoSet, WinoBias) and communication quality metrics (e.g., BLEU, human-rated empathy scores).\n   - Conduct moderated social media simulation tasks assessing bias reduction, clarity, and empathetic appropriateness.\n5. User Impact Studies:\n   - Deploy in controlled AI-based chatbot moderation scenarios with human participants to assess ethical communication effectiveness, user trust, and perceived bias mitigation.\n6. Comparative Analysis:\n   - Baseline against vanilla LLMs and existing post-hoc bias filtering methods.\n7. Iterative Refinement:\n   - Use ablation studies to refine auxiliary task weights and annotation schema.\nThis plan includes clear milestones, dataset scales, annotation fidelity standards, and concrete strategies to manage auxiliary task integration complexity, ensuring reproducibility and technical feasibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"I don’t think you should be so sensitive about that topic, it's probably just in your head.\"\nExpected Output: Moderator flags the implicit invalidation microaggression, responding with a clinically-informed, clear, and empathetic communication: \"It’s understandable that this topic can be sensitive; everyone’s feelings are valid and deserve respect. Let’s discuss this thoughtfully.\"\n\nInput: Social media thread where a user interrupts another repetitively.\nExpected Output: Detection of discourse act violations with moderated suggestions encouraging appropriate turn-taking and patience, maintaining clarity and empathy in tone.\n\nThrough these examples, the system demonstrates nuanced recognition and moderation of subtle biases using clinical communication ethics embedded within the language model.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should conflicts between auxiliary objectives and language modeling objectives impede stable training, we will pivot to a two-stage approach: (1) Train the base LLM separately, (2) Apply clinically-inspired post-processing filters and reranking modules guided by the learned clinical communication principles to moderate outputs. Additionally, we will explore reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) focusing explicitly on communication ethics and bias reduction derived from clinical expertise. This ensures practical bias mitigation remains achievable despite integration challenges, maintaining feasibility in AI-based chatbot and moderation applications."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines sensible stages but lacks concrete details on dataset suitability, scale, and annotation reliability for the clinically-annotated communication datasets. To ensure feasibility, specify: which existing datasets or how new datasets will be compiled, criteria for clinical annotation quality, and anticipated challenges in aligning these with social media contexts. Additionally, clarify how auxiliary objectives like empathy scoring will be operationalized quantitatively and integrated during joint training without adverse interference. This will strengthen the practical execution roadmap and enable reproducibility assessments early on, increasing confidence in feasibility and experimental rigor, especially given potential conflicts between objectives noted in the fallback plan (e.g., auxiliary loss conflicts). Without these, the experiment plan remains high-level and risks underestimating complexity or resource requirements in implementing clinical communication-informed training at scale for LLMs targeting bias mitigation and moderation tasks in social media contexts. Addressing this will enhance the robustness and credibility of the proposed method's validation process in practice, an essential step for progressing this idea feasibly toward impact realization in operational environments like AI-based chatbots and ethical moderation systems relevant to computational social science and IT ethics domains. Target more defined milestones and measurable criteria before proceeding to large-scale joint training and deployment stages, as current pipeline risks difficulty in iterative debugging and evaluation due to insufficient specificity on auxiliary data and objective design elements involved in bias and communication ethics modeling within the multi-objective paradigm proposed here. This advice aims to improve the refinement and operational clarity of the experiment protocol, critical for a high-stakes application area integrating clinical communication with advanced ML models for socially sensitive use cases. Please revise the experiment plan accordingly with explicit, data- and method-specific elaborations to ensure practical and technical feasibility of your approach at the intended scale and complexity given the novelty and interdisciplinary challenge inherent in your motivating problem statement and method conception context.
