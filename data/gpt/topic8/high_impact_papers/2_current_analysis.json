At the core of the treatment is the vision of human minds as prediction machines—devices that constantly try to stay one step ahead of the breaking waves of sensory stimulation, by actively predicting the incoming flow. In every situation we encounter, that complex prediction machinery is already buzzing, proactively trying to anticipate the sensory barrage. Surfing Uncertainty shows, in detail and with numerous examples, how this strange but potent strategy of self-anticipation ushers perception, understanding, and imagination simultaneously onto the cognitive stage. Action itself suddenly appears in a new and revealing light. For action is here not so much a ‘response to an input’ as a neat and efficient way of selecting the next ‘input’. As mobile embodied agents we act so as to harvest some of the streams of sensory information that our brains predict. This delivers fast and frugal problem-solving routines, and binds perception and action in a delicate dance: a virtuous circle in which neural circuits animate, and are animated by, the movements of our own bodies. Some of our actions, in turn, structure the physical, social, and technological worlds around us. This moves the goalposts for the predictive brain, by altering many of the things we need to engage and predict. Surfing Uncertainty thus brings work on the predictive brain into full and satisfying contact with work on the embodied and culturally situated mind.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'How to Solve It: Modern Heuristics', 'abstract': \"No pleasure lasts long unless there is variety in it. Publilius Syrus, Moral Sayings We've been very fortunate to receive fantastic feedback from our readers during the last four years, since the first edition of How to Solve It: Modern Heuristics was published in 1999. It's heartening to know that so many people appreciated the book and, even more importantly, were using the book to help them solve their problems. One professor, who published a review of the book, said that his students had given the best course reviews he'd seen in 15 years when using our text. There can be hardly any better praise, except to add that one of the book reviews published in a SIAM journal received the best review award as well. We greatly appreciate your kind words and personal comments that you sent, including the few cases where you found some typographical or other errors. Thank you all for this wonderful support.\"}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'A Metaverse: Taxonomy, Components, Applications, and Open Challenges', 'abstract': 'Unlike previous studies on the Metaverse based on Second Life, the current Metaverse is based on the social value of Generation Z that online and offline selves are not different. With the technological development of deep learning-based high-precision recognition models and natural generation models, Metaverse is being strengthened with various factors, from mobile-based always-on access to connectivity with reality using virtual currency. The integration of enhanced social activities and neural-net methods requires a new definition of Metaverse suitable for the present, different from the previous Metaverse. This paper divides the concepts and essential techniques necessary for realizing the Metaverse into three components (i.e., hardware, software, and contents) and three approaches (i.e., user interaction, implementation, and application) rather than marketing or hardware approach to conduct a comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, we describe essential methods based on three components and techniques to Metaverse’s representative Ready Player One, Roblox, and Facebook research in the domain of films, games, and studies. Finally, we summarize the limitations and directions for implementing the immersive Metaverse as social influences, constraints, and open challenges.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Handbook of Research Methods in Health Social Sciences', 'abstract': 'Research is defined by the Australian Research Council as “the creation of new knowledge and/or the use of existing knowledge in a new and creative way so as to generate new concepts, methodologies, inventions and understandings”. Research is thus the foundation for knowledge. It produces evidence and informs actions that can provide wider benefit to a society. The knowledge that researchers cultivate from a piece of research can be adopted for social and health programs that can improve the health and well-being of the individuals, their communities and the societies in which they live. As we have witnessed in all corners of the globe, research has become an endeavor that most of us in the health and social sciences cannot avoid. This Handbook is conceived to provide the foundation to readers who wish to embark on a research project in order to form knowledge that they need. The Handbook comprises four main sections: Traditional research methods sciences; Innovative research methods; Doing cross-cultural research; and Sensitive research methodology and approach. This Handbook attests to the diversity and richness of research methods in the health and social sciences. It will benefit many readers, particularly students and researchers who undertake research in health and social science areas. It is also valuable for the training needs of postgraduate students who wish to undertake research in cross-cultural settings, with special groups of people, as it provides essential knowledge not only on the methods of data collection but also salient issues that they need to know if they wish to succeed in their research endeavors.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Knowing Capitalism', 'abstract': '`This is an ambitious, original, and complex treatment of key aspects of contemporary capitalism. It makes a major contribution because it profoundly destabilizes the scholarship on globalization, the so-called new economy, information technology, distinct contemporary business cultures and practices\\' - Saskia Sassen, author of Globalization and its Discontents `Nigel Thrift offers us the sort of cultural analysis of global capitalism that has long been needed - one that emphasizes the innovative energy of global capitalism. The book avoids stale denouncements and offers instead a view of capitalism as a form of practice\\' - Karin Knorr Cetina, Professor of Sociology, University of Konstanz, GermanyCapitalism is well known for producing a form of existence where `everything solid melts into air\\'. But what happens when capitalism develops theories about itself? Are we moving into a condition in which capitalism can be said to possess a brain?These questions are pursued in this sparkling and thought-provoking book. Thrift looks at what he calls \"the cultural circuit of capitalism,\" the mechanism for generating new theories of capitalism. The book traces the rise of this circuit back to the 1960s when a series of institutions locked together to interrogate capitalism, to the present day, when these institutions are moving out to the Pacific basin and beyond. What have these theories produced? How have they been implicated in the speculative bubbles that characterized the late twentieth century? What part have they played in developing our understanding of human relations?Building on an inter-disciplinary approach which embraces the core social sciences, Thrift outlines an exciting new theory for understanding capitalism. His book is of interest to readers in Geography, Social Theory, Antrhopology and Cultural Economics.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Patient Safety in Developing Countries, Education, Research, Case Studies', 'abstract': 'Understanding the various aspects of patient safety education, practice, and research in developing countries is vital in preparing a plan to overcome the challenges of improving patient safety.

This book is the first study of its kind in its exploration of the complex relationship between contested U.S. notions of sexual order and shifting forms of Native American political representation. Offering a cultural and literary history that stretches from the early nineteenth century to the early twenty-first century, it demonstrates how U.S. imperialism against native peoples over the past two centuries can be understood as an effort to make them “straight”—to insert indigenous peoples into Anglo-American conceptions of family, home, desire, and personal identity. It shows how attempts by non-natives to cast native cultures as a perverse problem to be fixed or a liberating model to be emulated both rely on the erasure of indigenous political autonomy; reciprocally, it illustrates how native writers in several periods, in response, have insisted on the coherence and persistence of native polities by examining the ways traditions of kinship and residency give shape to particular modes of governance and land tenure.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Postcolonial Ecologies', 'abstract': 'This book brings ecocritical studies into a dialogue with postcolonial studies. By examining African, Caribbean, Pacific Island, and South Asian literatures and how they depict the relationship between humans and nature, this book makes a compelling argument for a more global approach to thinking through our current environmental crisis. Turning to the contemporary production of postcolonial novelists and poets, this book poses the literary imagination as a crucial to imagining what Eduoard Glissant calls the “aesthetics of the earth.” The book is organized around thematic concerns such as the relationship between culture and cultivation, arboriculture and deforestation, the lives of animals, and the relationship between the military and the tourist industry.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Multisystemic Resilience', 'abstract': 'Abstract Multisystemic Resilience brings together for the first time in one volume a wide range of resilience experts. By placing side-by-side the writing of psychologists, epigeneticists, ecologists, architects, disaster specialists, engineers, sociologists and public health researchers (to name just a few of the disciplines represented), this innovative volume provides insights into how to research resilience across systems and the many possible solutions to problems that threaten the physical and mental health of individuals, the wellbeing of our communities and the sustainability of our planet. Every chapter provides a detailed review of resilience from one disciplinary perspective, then uses examples drawn from research and case studies to show that thinking about the resilience of multiple systems is a better way to understand processes of change and sustainability.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "title": "Comprehensive Landscape Map for Research on Efficient Continual Learning Techniques in Adaptive World Knowledge Updating for Large Language Models",
    "current_research_landscape": "The analyzed research cluster centers on the concept of the 'predictive brain,' highlighting how cognitive systems actively anticipate streams of sensory information to enable rapid and efficient problem-solving routines in a dynamic technological world. The core focus lies in understanding and modeling these predictive mechanisms to inform adaptive learning and updating processes, mirroring embodied cognition and continuous self-anticipation. Dominant methods involve theoretical modeling of predictive cognition, interdisciplinary synthesis from neuroscience and cognitive science, and conceptual frameworks integrating embodiment and action to shape adaptive knowledge systems. The thematic clusters underscore two linked dimensions: a cognitive-scientific core (predictive brain, problem-solving, sensory information flow), and a meta-analytical dimension reflecting scholarly evaluation, modernization, and knowledge dissemination (book reviews, personal comments).",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps stem from the absence of direct bridges connecting the cognitive predictive paradigms with the meta-analysis and scholarly feedback dimensions, pointing to a fragmentation between foundational theoretical insights and their critical community validation or application feedback. Furthermore, foundational works acknowledge conceptual complexity but lack concrete computational models or empirical frameworks specific to continual learning in large language models — an application-critical gap. External and novel gaps emerge from the global context revealing latent interdisciplinary bridges: notably, the intersection of 'predictive brain' with domains such as neuropsychological assessment, mild traumatic brain injury studies, and cognitive performance testing (from second-order co-occurrence analysis). This indicates an overlooked opportunity to translate empirical cognitive and neurological assessment methods into validating continual learning mechanisms in adaptive AI systems. Such integration could address real-world validation deficits and foster robust adaptive updating grounded in human-like cognitive performance metrics.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Leverage neuropsychological evaluation techniques (e.g., performance validity tests used in traumatic brain injury assessment) to develop novel benchmarks and validation protocols for adaptive continual learning algorithms in large language models. This bridges the cognitive predictive theory in local thematic clusters with empirical clinical methodologies revealed as hidden bridges in global analysis.\n\nOpportunity 2: Integrate embodied cognition frameworks from 'predictive brain' research with interactive user feedback loops ('personal comments' cluster) to create dynamic, self-correcting continual learning architectures that adapt based on real-time human interaction data, thereby closing the existing gap between theoretical models and practical, user-centered adaptation.\n\nOpportunity 3: Develop interdisciplinary methodologies combining cognitive science paradigms of prediction and action with advanced computational heuristics (hinted in associated foundational works) to innovate efficient, scalable continual learning techniques specifically designed for real-time world knowledge updating in large language models, addressing both theoretical abstraction and application scalability challenges."
