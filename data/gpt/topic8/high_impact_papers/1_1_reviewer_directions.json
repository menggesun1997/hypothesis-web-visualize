    "title": "Channel-Equalized Commonsense Dialogue for Real-Time HRI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Real-time human-robot communication using LLMs is limited by computational overhead and communication noise, which degrade commonsense knowledge integration and response quality under dynamic environments.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external gap of underexploited channel estimation and equalization techniques from classical communication theory to improve robustness and efficiency in LLM-driven, real-time HRI systems, corresponding to opportunity 2 in the landscape map.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Incorporate adaptive channel estimation and equalization modules inspired by communication theory before language model processing. These modules denoise, compress, and adaptively filter sensor and dialogue signals ensuring that the LLM receives clearer contextual inputs. Additionally, propose a feedback mechanism where the LLM's output quality metrics inform channel adaptation parameters dynamically, balancing computational efficiency and commonsense reasoning fidelity.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Use real noisy HRI communication logs with accompanying sensor noise profiles. 2. Baselines: Standard LLM pipelines without channel equalization, state-of-the-art denoisers. 3. Metrics: Dialogue quality, inference latency, computational cost, and error rates under varying noise conditions. 4. Evaluation: Test adaptability under simulated channel noise and hardware constraints.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Audio command with background noise 'Please hand me the book.' Output after equalization and LLM: 'I understand you want the book; I will pick it up now.' Demonstrates noise filtering and maintained commonsense context comprehension.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If feedback-adaptive equalization shows instability, fallback to fixed equalization parameters tuned per environment. Alternatively, replace digital signal processing modules with learned denoising autoencoders integrated before LLM input embedding stages."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes incorporating adaptive channel estimation and equalization modules inspired by classical communication theory to preprocess inputs before feeding them into an LLM. However, the explanation lacks clarity on how these modules interface with the LLM input pipeline, especially considering differences between signal-level processing and high-level semantic embeddings. More details are needed on whether these modules operate on raw sensor signals, audio waveforms, or on the tokenized language inputs, and how the feedback mechanism quantitatively informs channel adaptation parameters in real time. Clarifying these design choices will strengthen the technical soundness of the approach and enable better reproducibility and evaluation design assumptions to be verified rigorously. Please elaborate on the exact signal processing architecture, data flow, and integration points with the LLM components in the final paper or proposal version, including formal definitions or diagrams if feasible to ensure the mechanism is both sound and implementable as described in the hypothesis phase. This clarity is critical, especially given the cross-disciplinary fusion of digital communication theory and language modeling targeted here, which can otherwise cause ambiguity or feasibility misalignment in downstream experiment steps and evaluations.

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the extensive prior art in LLMs and noise robustness, a promising way to further elevate impact and distinguish this work is to integrate deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques from the 'deep reinforcement learning' and 'ambient intelligence' concept clusters to optimize the channel equalization feedback loop dynamically. For example, the system could employ DRL agents to continuously adapt channel parameters based on multi-modal sensor signals and dialogue quality metrics, which would enable more robust policies that generalize across diverse environmental conditions and user behaviors. This would unite the proposed classic communication theory approach with state-of-the-art machine learning strategies in human-computer interaction and smart environments, broadening novelty and potential applicability. Exploring synergy with reinforcement learning algorithms also aligns well with the adaptive goals and may yield superior system efficiency and commonsense dialogue fidelity over manually tuned or purely heuristics-based methods. I suggest adding this direction as either an extension path or a core component, depending on resource availability, to sharpen the scientific contribution and competitive edge.
