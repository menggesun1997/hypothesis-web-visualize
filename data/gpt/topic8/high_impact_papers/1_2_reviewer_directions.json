    "title": "Cultural Commonsense Augmentation via Media-Informed Neural Machine Translation for HRI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Robots struggle to understand and express culturally nuanced commonsense knowledge leading to unnatural or contextually inappropriate human-robot interactions, due to insufficient integration of media studies insights with neural machine translation and multimodal speech recognition.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the external gap identified regarding the weak incorporation of media studies’ communication dynamics into computational models by proposing an interdisciplinary framework combining cultural media analysis with neural machine translation (NMT) for culturally-aware commonsense knowledge in LLM-based HRI systems.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a framework combining a media studies-driven cultural knowledge base with a multimodal speech recognition frontend feeding into a neural machine translation module that maps diverse cultural expressions into a normalized commonsense representation layered atop an LLM. The system enables context-aware translation of cultural idioms, gestures, and speech acts into robot responses tailored for the user's cultural background. Media studies methodologies inform data annotation and cultural context modeling.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Curate cross-cultural HRI datasets with annotated idioms, gestures, speech acts from diverse demographics. 2. Baselines: Conventional LLM without cultural modeling vs. proposed NMT + cultural KB approach. 3. Metrics: Appropriateness of responses, user satisfaction surveys, cross-cultural understanding accuracy. 4. Ablation: Remove cultural knowledge base or NMT step to quantify their contributions.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user says a culturally specific phrase with gesture (e.g., Japanese bowing with 'yoroshiku onegaishimasu'). Output: Robot replies with culturally appropriate, commonsense informed response acknowledging respect and intent rather than a literal translation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cultural data is sparse, generate synthetic cultural interaction examples using transfer learning from related languages/cultures. Alternatively, implement an adaptive user feedback loop to iteratively capture cultural nuances during interactions."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes an interdisciplinary framework combining cultural media analysis, neural machine translation (NMT), and multimodal speech recognition layered on LLMs, but it lacks clarity on critical technical details. For instance, the mechanism by which media studies methodologies inform data annotation and cultural context modeling is not concretely specified. How the system normalizes diverse cultural expressions into a unified commonsense representation, and how this interacts with the LLM, requires elaboration. Providing a clear end-to-end system architecture or pipeline with algorithmic modules and their interfaces would greatly strengthen the soundness and reproducibility of the method. Clarify the interaction between components and the data flow, especially how cultural nuances are integrated and utilized in real-time HRI scenarios. This will enhance confidence in the proposed method’s validity and implementation feasibility. Suggestions: include pseudo-code, model diagrams, or examples illustrating these mechanisms in detail to remove ambiguity and demonstrate technical viability. Target section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is a sound starting point but is optimistic about practicality without addressing some key feasibility challenges. For example, the curation of rich, cross-cultural HRI datasets with annotated idioms, gestures, and speech acts from diverse demographics is very resource-intensive and may suffer data sparsity. Additionally, how the annotation process incorporates media studies methodologies is unclear, which poses reproducibility and quality risks. Evaluation metrics such as user satisfaction surveys and appropriateness are subjective and require rigorous definition and scaling. The ablation study plans are promising but need detailed descriptions about experimental controls and statistical significance tests to ensure scientific rigor. To improve feasibility, the plan should explicitly consider dataset augmentation strategies, annotation guidelines rooted in media studies, and define benchmark tasks or simulation environments. Providing a timeline and resource estimates would also help. Target section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
