    "title": "Adaptive Knowledge Distillation Incorporating Policy Constraints for Sustainable LLM QA Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Distilling large encyclopedic knowledge into smaller efficient LLMs for open-domain QA often loses critical contextual and policy-aligned information, risking inaccurate or non-compliant responses.",
    "Motivation": "This idea bridges the internal gaps about failure modes and emergent capabilities of foundational models with the external gap linking policy and digital transformation, innovating an adaptive distillation process embedding policy constraints intrinsically.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a policy-aware knowledge distillation framework where the teacher LLM’s output is filtered and weighted by policy compliance modules during the student model training. The distillation loss is augmented with policy adherence constraints, resulting in a compressed student model that retains both encyclopedic coverage and dynamic policy constraints. The framework uses reinforcement signals from policy modules to adaptively focus on sensitive knowledge areas during distillation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use large teacher LLM trained on encyclopedic data annotated with policy constraints. 2. Train student models of varying sizes with adaptive policy-weighted distillation losses. 3. Evaluate on standard open-domain QA benchmarks with policy-sensitive questions. 4. Measure compliance, accuracy, and generalization compared to conventional distillation. 5. Perform robustness tests against policy changes and out-of-distribution questions.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'What are the licensing considerations for AI-generated music?'\nOutput: Student model answers reflecting licensing policy nuances retained from teacher’s policy-aware knowledge encoding.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive weighting destabilizes training, try curriculum learning where simpler policy-aligned knowledge is distilled first, progressively adding complexity. Alternatively, separate policy and encyclopedic heads in student models."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a policy-aware adaptive knowledge distillation framework but lacks explicit detail on how policy compliance modules generate reinforcement signals and integrate with distillation loss during training. Clarify the architecture and interaction between policy modules, teacher outputs, and student training, including how weighting is dynamically adjusted without destabilizing the training process to better validate the soundness of the method's mechanism and practical implementation feasibility. Consider formalizing the policy constraint representation and how feedback signals are computed and backpropagated within the student model training loop to assure clear technical grounding and reproducibility potential; this clarity is critical as the interplay of reinforcement signals with distillation loss is a complex novelty point of the idea. This will also aid in assessing risks such as training instability or convergence issues upfront rather than relying on fallback plans empirically later. Section targeted: Proposed_Method."

          "feedback_content": "To elevate the impact and novelty beyond the competitive baseline, integrate the idea with federated learning from the given globally-linked concepts. Specifically, propose a federated adaptive knowledge distillation framework where policy-aware distillation occurs across decentralized student models on edge devices or organizational silos, preserving local policy constraints and data privacy. This extension would enable real-time adaptation to varying regional or domain-specific policies in large-scale deployments, thereby enhancing the practical utility and generalization of compressed LLM QA systems. Including incremental learning to continuously refine policy compliance post-deployment under this federated setup can further bolster sustainability and compliance robustness. This direction addresses both the internal complexity and external transformational linkage, significantly broadening the scope and application impact relevant for premier conferences.
