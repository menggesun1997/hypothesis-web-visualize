    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of structured, dynamically updated commonsense knowledge graphs informed by media studies perspectives reduces the richness and contextual relevance of multimodal LLM outputs in HRI.",
    "Motivation": "Calls on the external gap of weak integration of media studies and neural methods by building media-informed commonsense knowledge graphs that fuse communication dynamics insights with multimodal sensory data feeding LLMs, aiming to enrich commonsense knowledge representation for human-robot dialogue and interaction.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a dynamic commonsense knowledge graph leveraging media content analysis techniques (e.g., narrative structures, interaction patterns) to represent contextual and relational commonsense knowledge. Sensor data from HRI settings dynamically update the graph state. The LLM queries this evolving graph during response generation for grounded and context-specific answers. The architecture blends graph neural networks, media analysis pipelines, and LLM conditioning.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Media-rich HRI interaction logs paired with media studies annotations. 2. Evaluate: Dialogue richness, grounding accuracy, commonsense reasoning improvements. 3. Compare: Static knowledge base approaches vs. dynamic media-informed graph approach.",

    "Fallback_Plan": "If graph updates are slow or inaccurate, precompute graphs offline and use attention mechanisms to weight static commonsense subgraphs. Alternatively, simplify graph structure focusing on core relational triples to reduce complexity."

        "title": "Media-Informed Commonsense Knowledge Graph Generation for Multimodal LLMs in HRI",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) used in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) lack access to structured, dynamically updated commonsense knowledge graphs that effectively integrate media studies insights with real-time sensory data, limiting the richness, contextual relevance, and cultural awareness of robot responses during interactions.",
        "Motivation": "Despite advancements in multimodal LLMs and knowledge graph integration, existing methods often fail to computationally formalize media narrative structures and interaction patterns within dynamic commonsense knowledge representations, weakening robot intelligence in social contexts. By bridging media studies and natural language understanding through a novel computational framework that fuses media-informed commonsense with multimodal sensory data, this work addresses a critical external gap and advances agent reasoning for culturally aware, empathetic, and context-sensitive HRI responses. This approach emphasizes scalability and operational robustness, distinguishing it from static or narrowly focused knowledge base integrations.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-stage computational pipeline combining natural language processing and vision-language models to extract and represent media narrative structures and interaction patterns from annotated media-rich HRI datasets. Media studies insights are formalized into ontology-driven relational schemas capturing narrative arcs, emotional cues, and communicative dynamics. Concurrently, multimodal sensory inputs (visual, auditory, physiological) are processed in real-time using sensor fusion algorithms to detect affective and contextual signals. A dynamic commonsense knowledge graph is then incrementally updated by synchronizing ontology-based media annotations with sensor-derived context via a graph neural network (GNN) architecture designed for consistency and latency-aware updates. The GNN incorporates attention mechanisms to reconcile potential data mismatches and prioritize relevant relational triples grounded in cultural and situational context. During response generation, the LLM is conditioned on graph embeddings combined with media-informed commonsense to produce grounded, culturally aware, and empathetic dialogues. Robust interaction protocols and system-level soundness are ensured via asynchronous update queues and temporal alignment algorithms, minimizing latency and ensuring reproducibility. This framework uniquely integrates media narrative schemas, vision-language model outputs, and scalable graph reasoning for enhanced HRI dialogue intelligence.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Curate a media-rich HRI interaction corpus by collecting multimodal interaction logs from controlled social robot deployments, augmented with expert media studies annotations following a standardized protocol capturing narrative structures, emotional states, and interaction patterns. Dataset size target: 500+ sessions with diverse demographics to ensure domain representativeness. 2. System Integration: Implement the multimodal pipeline including NLP and vision-language models for media insight extraction, sensor fusion for real-time contextual updates, and GNN-based dynamic commonsense graph construction with asynchronous update protocols. 3. Evaluation Metrics: Employ quantitative metrics such as BLEU and METEOR for dialogue naturalness; grounding accuracy measured via alignment between LLM responses and graph context; commonsense reasoning assessed through established benchmarks (e.g., CommonsenseQA adapted to HRI); and culturally-aware empathy scored using human-rated scales. Statistical significance will be tested with paired t-tests and bootstrapping over multiple runs. 4. Comparative Baselines: Contrast the proposed dynamic media-informed graph approach against static knowledge graphs, pure sensor-driven updates, and state-of-the-art multimodal LLM baselines with no graph integration. 5. Ablation Studies: Isolate effects of media narrative schemas, sensor fusion, and attention-based graph updates by selectively disabling components. 6. Scalability and Latency Analysis: Measure graph update times and response generation latency under varying data loads and sensor noise. 7. Reproducibility: Release code, dataset annotations, and protocols to promote reproducible research.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: In an interactive scenario, the robot detects user frustration through speech prosody and facial expression analysis in a visually rich multimedia environment. The dynamic knowledge graph, continuously updated with media narrative context like conflict-resolution patterns, is queried. Output: The LLM generates responses exhibiting empathetic understanding, referencing culturally appropriate media-informed dialogue strategies, and proposing context-relevant solutions acknowledging the user's emotional state while maintaining natural flow and engagement. Another test: Robot handles ambiguous user commands by leveraging disambiguation patterns learned from media interaction narratives combined with real-time sensor cues to ask clarifying questions, exhibiting intelligent decision-making and model reasoning.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time graph updating introduces unacceptable latency or synchronization challenges, we will implement a hybrid approach where core media-informed subgraphs are precomputed offline with incremental, low-dimensional sensor-driven updates applied online via lightweight attention weighting. We will also simplify graph schemas focusing on high-impact relational triples related to emotion and dialogue intent. Additionally, we will incorporate adversarial robustness techniques to maintain graph integrity against noisy or incomplete sensor input, ensuring stable LLM conditioning. If integrating vision-language models proves infeasible at scale, we will pivot to modular NLP-only models enriched with pre-trained language models fine-tuned on media narratives to approximate media insights."

However, the mechanism by which these heterogeneous components interface remains under-specified, particularly how media studies insights are computationally formalized and fused with sensory data in real-time. Clarify the computational models or algorithms that will extract and represent media narrative structures and interaction patterns, and explicate the process for synchronizing these with sensor updates to maintain graph consistency and relevance during LLM querying. Address potential latency or data mismatch issues in dynamic graph updates to establish robust operational semantics and system-level soundness of the method's pipeline and interaction protocols. Without this, the core technical contribution risks being insufficiently grounded and difficult to implement or reproduce effectively, weakening the overall research soundness and credibility of the proposal. This refinement is critical before progressing to experimentation stages to avoid costly redesigns or non-convergent outcomes in later phases."
