        "title": "Psychologically Grounded Uncertainty Modeling for Enhanced Interpretability in LLM Moderation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language model (LLM) moderation systems provide uncertainty estimates primarily as calibrated confidence scores without a rigorous theoretical foundation linking these metrics to human psychological experiences of uncertainty, such as ambiguity and conflict in cognitive processing. This gap limits the interpretability and practical utility of uncertainty outputs in real-world moderation decision-making, where human moderators face complex psychological states that influence content interpretation. The core assumption that psychological uncertainty constructs can be meaningfully quantified and mapped to statistical uncertainty metrics in LLMs requires empirical validation and stronger theoretical backing to ensure that model interpretability enhancements truly align with moderator cognitive processes and improve moderation outcomes.",
        "Motivation": "Although existing LLM moderation frameworks utilize uncertainty estimation techniques (e.g., Bayesian methods, ensembles) to provide confidence scores, these approaches often lack interpretability aligned with human cognitive states, reducing moderators' trust and effectiveness. Our approach bridges this critical gap by integrating well-established psychological theories of uncertainty—specifically, constructs of ambiguity and conflict from cognitive science—into the probabilistic bias interpretation frameworks of LLM moderation. By grounding uncertainty estimation in explicit psychological constructs and validating this linkage through empirical studies, our method advances beyond mere calibration to deliver human-aligned uncertainty rationales that promote technological transparency, enhancing moderators' decision confidence and reducing error rates. This novelty leverages AI-assisted decision-making principles and incorporates structural equation modeling to rigorously quantify the relationships between model uncertainty and human psychological uncertainty. Ultimately, our research contributes a robust, theoretically grounded, and empirically validated framework for uncertainty modeling in LLM moderation — a significant advancement over prior work that treats uncertainty as abstract probabilistic outputs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose to augment LLM moderation systems with uncertainty estimations explicitly mapped to psychological constructs of ambiguity and conflict, supported by a comprehensive theoretical framework and empirical validation. First, we will conduct a preliminary validation study to quantify human moderators' psychological uncertainty (rated as ambiguity and conflict levels) on moderation examples and correlate these with probabilistic uncertainty metrics from Bayesian and ensemble LLM variants, using structural equation modeling to establish latent variable relationships. Second, guided by the Technology Acceptance Model and determinants of users’ intention, we will design human-interpretable uncertainty explanations tied to psychological constructs to enhance technological transparency and moderator trust. Third, we will develop a replicable, data-driven mapping function (e.g., regression and factor analysis) linking model uncertainty scores to psychological uncertainty annotations to produce enriched output: calibrated confidence intervals alongside human-aligned uncertainty rationales emphasizing ambiguity and conflict. Finally, we integrate this framework into a human-in-the-loop LLM moderation system and assess its impact on moderator decision-making, confidence, and error rates. This approach also incorporates adaptive learning system principles to iteratively refine annotation quality and mapping validity through pilot annotation cycles.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Preliminary validation study: Collect a pilot dataset with moderation cases rated by expert human moderators for perceived ambiguity and conflict using a standardized annotation protocol informed by cognitive theory and detailed annotator guidelines. Incorporate training sessions to reduce inter-annotator variability and bias.\n2. Obtain uncertainty estimates from Bayesian and ensemble-based LLM moderation models on the same dataset.\n3. Use structural equation modeling and regression analyses to quantify and validate the mapping between psychological uncertainty constructs (ambiguity and conflict) and model uncertainty metrics.\n4. Develop the mapping function from model uncertainty outputs to psychologically grounded uncertainty explanations.\n5. Expand annotation dataset with multiple iterative annotation cycles to improve label consistency and coverage.\n6. Integrate the mapping into a human-in-the-loop moderation tool presenting calibrated confidence and psychologically informed uncertainty rationales.\n7. Conduct controlled usability experiments comparing this system against baseline LLM moderation with generic uncertainty scores, measuring error rates, calibration metrics (e.g., Expected Calibration Error), moderator decision confidence (self-reports), perceived technological transparency, and acceptance using standardized scales.\n8. Analyze results to establish empirical gains and refine the approach.\n\nThroughout, mitigate risks by managing annotation noise, ensuring sufficient sample diversity, and performing pilot annotations to calibrate procedures.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example inputs:  \n- Ambiguous social media post containing sarcasm or cultural references that might trigger varying interpretations.\n- Moderation cases with conflicting cues leading to uncertainty about policy compliance.\n\nExpected outputs:  \n- Moderation classification (e.g., safe, flagged) annotated with a calibrated confidence interval.\n- Human-interpretable uncertainty rationale describing the level and nature of uncertainty in terms of psychological ambiguity and conflict constructs.\n\nFor instance, the model may output: \"Flagged with 75% confidence; moderate ambiguity due to conflicting cues in user sentiment and policy context, highlighting potential interpretation variability.\"",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the empirical mapping between psychological uncertainty constructs and model uncertainty metrics does not achieve satisfactory alignment, we will pivot to integrating externally defined psychological uncertainty heuristics derived from established cognitive theories as post-hoc interpretability overlays on deterministic interpretability scores produced by LLM moderation models. This includes augmenting moderation explanations with context-sensitive uncertainty flags reflecting typical human cognitive conflict or ambiguity indicators identified in literature. Additionally, we will employ semi-supervised techniques to expand annotation datasets and explore alternative uncertainty estimation methods (e.g., conformal prediction) to improve alignment. Ultimately, we will ensure that even fallback systems prioritize technological transparency and moderator usability, maintaining partial human-in-the-loop interpretability benefits."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that psychological uncertainty constructs can be effectively quantified and integrated into LLM moderation uncertainty estimates requires stronger foundational support. The proposal should more clearly justify why and how psychological ambiguities—like conflict and ambiguity in human cognition—map onto model uncertainties. Clarify the theoretical backing and any prior empirical evidence that connects these cognitive constructs with uncertainty estimation in machine learning models to strengthen the assumption validity and avoid conceptual gaps that could undermine the model's interpretability and trust claims. This will ensure the approach is theoretically grounded and the interpretability gains are meaningful and aligned with human moderators' cognitive processing patterns rather than being a speculative overlay of psychological theory onto probabilistic uncertainty metrics.\n\nSpecifically, elaborate on how ambiguous/conflicting psychological states translate into statistical uncertainty and why this will realistically improve moderator decision-making beyond the current state of calibrated confidence scores alone. This will enhance soundness by validating the foundational premise in the Problem Statement and Proposed Method sections, reducing the risk of a theoretical mismatch between psychological concepts and model outputs without empirical grounding or falsifiability in the planned experiments.\n\nRecommendation: Include citations of prior work bridging psychological uncertainty and probabilistic modeling, or plan a preliminary validation study linking human psychological uncertainty ratings with computational uncertainty metrics to confirm this assumption early in the research cycle."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step-by-Step Experiment Plan lacks detailed consideration of the practical challenges in procuring high-quality human uncertainty annotations and establishing reliable mappings between psychological uncertainty constructs and model uncertainty outputs. Human annotation of uncertainty/confidence levels is notoriously noisy and subjective, which may impact data quality and downstream model calibration.\n\nTo enhance feasibility, the plan should articulate clear strategies for:\n1. Defining annotation protocols to minimize inter-annotator variability and bias, potentially through training or guidelines informed by cognitive theory.\n2. Ensuring a sufficient quantity and diversity of annotated examples to robustly train and evaluate Bayesian or ensemble-based models.\n3. Designing the mapping methods between model uncertainty and psychological constructs with concrete, replicable metrics or modeling approaches (e.g., regression, correlation analyses).\n4. Incorporating pilot studies or iterative annotation cycles to refine label quality and model fit.\n\nIn addition, the evaluation criteria in Step 4 and the usability testing in Step 5 require more explicit metrics and benchmarks to demonstrate concrete improvements over baseline moderation systems. Define which error rates, calibration scores, and decision-confidence measures will quantify success and how these relate to practical moderation scenarios.\n\nOverall, strengthen the experimental plan with more operational detail and risk mitigation strategies to ensure scientific rigor and the demonstration of compelling empirical gains on the proposed integrated uncertainty modeling approach."
