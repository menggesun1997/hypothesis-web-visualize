    "Problem_Statement": "Semantic encoding of encyclopedic knowledge in LLMs is often opaque, limiting trust and usability in human-AI collaborative open-domain question answering scenarios.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external gap between 'practical robots' and 'digital transformation' via socio-technical frameworks and interpretability research, addressing internal limitations around transparency and trust in LLMs’ encyclopedic knowledge representations.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a socio-technical framework integrating human-in-the-loop interaction into LLM semantic encoding. The method uses explainable AI (XAI) techniques to visualize and modulate the semantic knowledge layers interacting in real time with users. Inspired by human-robot collaboration interfaces, it enables users to query, correct, or augment the LLM’s world knowledge encoding interactively, promoting transparency and co-adaptation. The system architecture pairs an LLM with an XAI module exposing knowledge attribution and semantic pathways, alongside a user interface for feedback and knowledge refinement.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop a prototype integrating explainability tools (like attention visualization) with a base LLM. 2. Recruit human participants to perform open-domain QA tasks requiring complex knowledge queries. 3. Measure transparency, trust, and answer accuracy compared to non-interactive baselines. 4. Analyze how user feedback modifies semantic encoding and improves performance. 5. Evaluate system usability with standard socio-technical assessment scales. 6. Test scenarios include multi-turn QA and corrections of hallucinated facts.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User asks, 'Explain the role of photosynthesis in the carbon cycle.'\nSystem provides transparent attention heatmaps showing contributing facts.\nUser identifies a knowledge gap and inputs correction: 'Include recent findings on oceanic carbon absorption.'\nSystem adapts semantic encoding accordingly, improving subsequent QA responses.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time human intervention slows system responsiveness, develop offline batch human feedback loops. Alternatively, improve interpretability via intrinsic model designs (e.g., modular semantic layers) reducing dependency on interactive interfaces."

        "title": "Human-Robot Collaboration Inspired Transparency Framework for Semantic Encoding in LLMs via Dynamic Graph Neural Integration and Multimodal Interaction",
        "Problem_Statement": "Semantic encoding of encyclopedic knowledge in large language models (LLMs) remains largely opaque and static, restricting user trust, interpretability, and adaptive co-learning in human-AI collaborative open-domain question answering. Existing approaches lack clear, scalable methods to incorporate real-time user feedback into the model's underlying semantic representations while maintaining model stability and performance.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the critical external gap between practical robotic interfaces and digital transformation demands innovative socio-technical frameworks that enable transparent, trustworthy, and adaptable LLM semantic knowledge representations. This work targets the internal limitation of current LLM semantic encoding by pioneering an interactive co-adaptation mechanism grounded in graph neural networks (GNNs) and multimodal deep learning techniques. By integrating structured graph-encoded encyclopedic knowledge with human-in-the-loop feedback through rich, multimodal interfaces, the framework promises to surpass state-of-the-art interpretability and user-guided refinement capabilities, opening pathways for impactful applications including electronic health records and public health knowledge bases where explainability is paramount. This re-engineered approach distinctly advances beyond prior work by operationalizing real-time model semantic graph updates driven by user input, verified with rigorous quantitative metrics, thereby elevating feasibility, reliability, and impact in the highly competitive NLP landscape.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a socio-technical framework that fuses large language models with dynamic graph neural networks to represent semantic encyclopedic knowledge as structured graphs amenable to user-driven refinement. The system's architecture pairs: (1) a base LLM producing semantic knowledge graphs via extracted entities and relations; (2) a graph neural network module that encodes and updates these graphs in light of user corrections or augmentations; (3) an explainable AI (XAI) interface harnessing multimodal deep learning to produce interpretable visualizations including attention heatmaps, graph visualizations, and domain-specific diagrams; and (4) a multimodal user interface that supports natural language, graphical annotations, and visual inputs for interactive feedback. User corrections trigger controlled, fine-grained updates to the semantic graph embeddings via a novel, efficient graph-level fine-tuning algorithm that preserves model stability and performance, enabling real-time or batched model co-adaptation without retraining the entire LLM. This graph-centric updating mechanism leverages prompt-tuning on graph representations and modular adapters external to the core LLM weights, thereby maintaining integrity and scalability. By encoding encyclopedic knowledge and user feedback as graph-structured data, our approach endows the framework with structured interpretability and richer semantic pathways beyond traditional attention maps. Integration of multimodal deep learning elements enhances grounding and explanation depth, particularly valuable for complex, domain-specific QA domains like healthcare.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop the prototype integrating an LLM with semantic knowledge graph extraction and a graph neural network (GNN) module capable of dynamic updates through fine-tuning on graph embeddings. 2. Construct multimodal XAI visualizations (graph views, heatmaps, domain-specific diagrams) and interactive feedback UI supporting natural language and visual annotations. 3. Recruit human participants with domain expertise for open-domain QA tasks across general and specialized knowledge areas (e.g., public health). Provide standardized training on system use to control cognitive load. 4. Create baseline conditions: (a) LLM without interaction, (b) LLM with static explanations, (c) full interactive co-adaptation with feedback updates. 5. Measure quantitative metrics: (i) Changes in semantic graph structure and embeddings pre- and post-user feedback via graph similarity and embedding distance metrics; (ii) QA performance improvements on held-out queries; (iii) Trust and transparency using validated psychometric scales; (iv) System usability and cognitive load using SUS and NASA-TLX scales; (v) Model stability by monitoring performance variance on unrelated tasks post-update. 6. Design controlled experiments to counterbalance task order and feedback frequency to measure interaction overhead and responsiveness impacts. 7. Evaluate real-time versus batch update mechanisms for practicality and scalability. 8. Conduct case studies in complex multi-turn QA involving correction of hallucinated facts and incorporation of new domain knowledge.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User asks, 'Explain the role of photosynthesis in the carbon cycle, including recent advances in oceanic carbon absorption.' System generates an initial semantic knowledge graph illustrating related biological and chemical processes, with attention heatmaps and oceanic diagrams. User detects missing links related to marine carbon uptake and employs natural language feedback and graphical annotations to add new nodes and edges. The graph neural network module integrates these modifications via prompt-tuning-based graph refactoring, updating embeddings without retraining the entire LLM. Subsequent queries reflect enriched knowledge, and the system visually highlights the updated pathways. Quantitatively, embedding similarity metrics confirm semantic graph adaptation, while QA accuracy improves on related questions. Trust and usability surveys show increased user confidence and satisfaction compared to baseline conditions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time interactive graph updates cause system latency or instability, we will implement an offline batched update pipeline where user feedback is accumulated and used to fine-tune graph embeddings during scheduled maintenance cycles ensuring system responsiveness. Alternatively, the framework can revert to enhanced intrinsic interpretability by constraining LLM outputs to predefined modular semantic components represented as stable graphs, enabling lightweight user feedback incorporation through modular adapter tuning rather than full graph refactoring, preserving core model integrity and scalability."

However, the mechanism by which user feedback effectively 'modulates' or 'adapts' the LLM's internal semantic encoding lacks clarity and technical detail. For instance, how the corrections or augmentations provided by the user are incorporated back into the model—whether via fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or another approach—is not specified. This creates uncertainty about the actual model update or adaptation mechanism, its scalability, and its impact on model integrity. A clearer, detailed explanation or design of the interaction between user input and model internals would strengthen the soundness of the method substantially. Please clarify or provide a concrete technical implementation plan to realize this interactive co-adaptation step, including how semantic knowledge representation is modifiable in real time or through batch updates without compromising model stability or performance constraints. This will enhance the reviewer's confidence in the proposed framework's feasibility and reliability in practical deployment scenarios. (Target section: Proposed_Method)"

However, the plan lacks detailed methodology on how the semantic encoding modifications made by users will be quantitatively measured and validated.

Additionally, the recruitment and training design for human participants, strategies to control for cognitive load in interaction, and measures to counterbalance potential slowdowns from interactive feedback loops should be articulated. Without such details, the feasibility of reliably concluding improvements in semantic encoding and real-time co-adaptation remains uncertain.
