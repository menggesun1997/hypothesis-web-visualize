    "title": "Psychologically Informed Uncertainty Modeling for Bias Interpretation in LLM Moderation",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM bias detection rarely incorporates human psychological uncertainty factors, missing opportunities to align model interpretability with real-world content moderation cognitive challenges.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external critical gap through integration of psychological uncertainty and cognitive control theories into probabilistic bias interpretation frameworks, enhancing moderation transparency and user trust.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Augment LLM moderation models with probabilistic uncertainty estimations reflecting psychological constructs of ambiguity and conflict in interpretation. The model outputs include calibrated confidence intervals and human-aligned uncertainty explanations guiding moderator attention to uncertain or borderline cases.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets annotated with uncertainty/confidence levels by human experts.\n2. Implement Bayesian or ensemble-based LLM variants estimating predictive uncertainty.\n3. Develop mapping from model uncertainty to psychological uncertainty constructs.\n4. Evaluate calibration and correlation with human uncertainty ratings.\n5. Test usability in moderation setups measuring decision confidence and error rates.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Ambiguous social media text that can be interpreted variably.\nExpected Output: Moderation classification with calibrated confidence score and human-readable uncertainty rationale.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If uncertainty estimates lack alignment, fallback to deterministic interpretability scores combined with external psychological uncertainty heuristics or semi-supervised uncertainty annotation augmentation."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that psychological uncertainty constructs can be effectively quantified and integrated into LLM moderation uncertainty estimates requires stronger foundational support. The proposal should more clearly justify why and how psychological ambiguities—like conflict and ambiguity in human cognition—map onto model uncertainties. Clarify the theoretical backing and any prior empirical evidence that connects these cognitive constructs with uncertainty estimation in machine learning models to strengthen the assumption validity and avoid conceptual gaps that could undermine the model's interpretability and trust claims. This will ensure the approach is theoretically grounded and the interpretability gains are meaningful and aligned with human moderators' cognitive processing patterns rather than being a speculative overlay of psychological theory onto probabilistic uncertainty metrics.\n\nSpecifically, elaborate on how ambiguous/conflicting psychological states translate into statistical uncertainty and why this will realistically improve moderator decision-making beyond the current state of calibrated confidence scores alone. This will enhance soundness by validating the foundational premise in the Problem Statement and Proposed Method sections, reducing the risk of a theoretical mismatch between psychological concepts and model outputs without empirical grounding or falsifiability in the planned experiments.\n\nRecommendation: Include citations of prior work bridging psychological uncertainty and probabilistic modeling, or plan a preliminary validation study linking human psychological uncertainty ratings with computational uncertainty metrics to confirm this assumption early in the research cycle."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step-by-Step Experiment Plan lacks detailed consideration of the practical challenges in procuring high-quality human uncertainty annotations and establishing reliable mappings between psychological uncertainty constructs and model uncertainty outputs. Human annotation of uncertainty/confidence levels is notoriously noisy and subjective, which may impact data quality and downstream model calibration.\n\nTo enhance feasibility, the plan should articulate clear strategies for:\n1. Defining annotation protocols to minimize inter-annotator variability and bias, potentially through training or guidelines informed by cognitive theory.\n2. Ensuring a sufficient quantity and diversity of annotated examples to robustly train and evaluate Bayesian or ensemble-based models.\n3. Designing the mapping methods between model uncertainty and psychological constructs with concrete, replicable metrics or modeling approaches (e.g., regression, correlation analyses).\n4. Incorporating pilot studies or iterative annotation cycles to refine label quality and model fit.\n\nIn addition, the evaluation criteria in Step 4 and the usability testing in Step 5 require more explicit metrics and benchmarks to demonstrate concrete improvements over baseline moderation systems. Define which error rates, calibration scores, and decision-confidence measures will quantify success and how these relate to practical moderation scenarios.\n\nOverall, strengthen the experimental plan with more operational detail and risk mitigation strategies to ensure scientific rigor and the demonstration of compelling empirical gains on the proposed integrated uncertainty modeling approach."
