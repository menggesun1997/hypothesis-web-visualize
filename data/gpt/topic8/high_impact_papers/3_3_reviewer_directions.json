    "title": "Neuro-Psycholinguistic Continual Learning Inspired by Second Language Acquisition",
    "Problem_Statement": "Continual learning in LLMs does not currently simulate human-like incremental language and world knowledge learning processes observed in second language acquisition, limiting robustness and generalization.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap of overlooked psychological paradigms (advanced second language acquisition and adaptive information processing) by integrating human-inspired incremental learning strategies into LLM continual learning, thereby improving learning stability and knowledge transfer efficiency.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a multi-stage continual learning framework that mimics stages of human second language acquisition: initial comprehension with high plasticity, followed by structural consolidation and incremental semantic expansion. Use curriculum learning with adaptive information complexity schedules and incorporate meta-cognitive control modules emulating human attentional and memory mechanisms to regulate knowledge integration and retrieval.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Create staged datasets modeling incremental language complexity and domain shift.\n2) Train baseline LLM continual learners.\n3) Implement curriculum schedules inspired by language acquisition theories.\n4) Add meta-cognitive regulation modules controlling plasticity.\n5) Evaluate retention, transfer learning, and robustness to noisy input.\n6) Compare to vanilla continual learning methods.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Incremental exposure to technical jargon and morphological variants in a new domain.\nExpected output: Smooth incremental knowledge representation growth with minimal catastrophic forgetting and improved generalization on downstream tasks.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If acquisition-stage inspired curricula do not produce gains, experiment with alternative forgetting mitigation techniques or embedding regularization aligned with psycholinguistic principles."

          "feedback_content": "The 'Proposed_Method' outlines an ambitious multi-stage learning framework inspired by human second language acquisition, invoking plasticity phases, curriculum learning, and meta-cognitive control modules. However, the description remains high-level and does not specify concrete architectural choices, calibration strategies, or precise mechanisms for implementing these stages within LLMs. Clarifying how meta-cognitive regulation will be operationalized (e.g., via gating mechanisms, attention modulation, or memory replay systems), and detailing the curriculum design specifics, will enhance the soundness and reproducibility of this approach. Without these clarifications, it is challenging to assess if the mechanism is implementable or to benchmark it against existing continual learning models effectively. Strengthening this section with a schematic or pseudo-code would be valuable for convincing reviewers of the method's novelty and feasibility, beyond conceptual inspiration from psycholinguistics and cognitive science frameworks. This is critical given the competitive nature of the field and existing approaches with similar cognitive analogies applied to LLMs.  \n\nRecommendation: Provide explicit method components, their interactions, and hypothesized improvements over baseline continual learners at a mechanistic level in the Propose_Method section to substantiate claims and enable precise evaluation and replication."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the broad, yet somewhat generic description of improvements in learning stability and knowledge transfer, the idea could benefit substantially by directly integrating and benchmarking against state-of-the-art continual learning or domain adaptation methods in language models. Explicitly leveraging recent advances in 'word representations' and 'meta-learning' within LLMs and tying the neuro-psycholinguistic principles to measurable improvements on 'human-like tasks' (e.g., contextual understanding, dialogue, or multilingual tasks) would enhance impact and differentiability. \n\nRecommendation: Propose a concrete integration plan that combines this neuro-inspired framework with cutting-edge representation learning techniques or adapter modules, and suggest experiments targeting complex, human-centered benchmarks. This alignment with established global concepts will increase practical relevance and facilitate stronger claims about the approach's competitive edge and real-world utility."
