    "Motivation": "Targets the external gap of underexploited channel estimation and equalization techniques from classical communication theory to improve robustness and efficiency in LLM-driven, real-time HRI systems, corresponding to opportunity 2 in the landscape map.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Incorporate adaptive channel estimation and equalization modules inspired by communication theory before language model processing. These modules denoise, compress, and adaptively filter sensor and dialogue signals ensuring that the LLM receives clearer contextual inputs. Additionally, propose a feedback mechanism where the LLM's output quality metrics inform channel adaptation parameters dynamically, balancing computational efficiency and commonsense reasoning fidelity.",

        "title": "Channel-Equalized Commonsense Dialogue for Real-Time HRI with Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization",
        "Problem_Statement": "Real-time human-robot communication using large language models (LLMs) faces significant challenges due to environmental noise, sensor imperfections, and computational overhead, which hinder the integration of robust commonsense knowledge and degrade response quality under dynamic and noisy conditions.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work has explored noise robustness and denoising methods for LLM-driven dialogue, these approaches often neglect cross-disciplinary integration with classical communication theory techniques and adaptive machine learning strategies. This proposal exploits the external gap in leveraging adaptive channel estimation and equalization from digital communications, combined with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to dynamically optimize signal preprocessing in human-robot interaction (HRI) settings. This fusion is novel as it bridges signal-level noise mitigation with high-level semantic processing via LLMs, thereby improving dialogue robustness and commonsense reasoning fidelity. Addressing this opportunity advances ambient intelligence and real-time HRI by providing a rigorously adaptive, efficient, and semantically aware communication pipeline.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel hybrid architecture comprising three tightly integrated components: (1) a multi-modal adaptive channel estimation and equalization module operating directly on raw multi-sensor signals (audio waveforms, visual sensor streams) to denoise and compress inputs before language tokenization; (2) a large language model pipeline that receives these enhanced semantic-contextual embeddings generated post-equalization; and (3) a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent that dynamically controls channel equalization parameters in real-time based on continuous feedback. The data flow begins with raw sensor input signals processed by digital signal processing blocks that perform adaptive filtering, compression, and noise mitigation informed by statistical channel models. Processed signals are then transformed into semantic embeddings feeding the LLM, preserving commonsense contextual cues. The DRL agent receives multi-modal dialogue quality metrics (e.g., response coherence, latency, comprehension accuracy) and environment conditions as state inputs and learns policies to adjust channel parameters optimizing the tradeoff between computational cost and dialogue fidelity over time. This feedback loop employs proximal policy optimization (PPO) to ensure stable and generalizable adaptation across varying noise profiles and interaction scenarios. Clear architectural diagrams and formal definitions of the signal processing and DRL integration interfaces will be provided to precisely define data tensors, parameter spaces, and update schedules, ensuring reproducibility and rigorous evaluation alignment. This cross-disciplinary synergy unites classical communications and advanced ambient intelligence methods, elevating the state of art beyond heuristic or static denoisers.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Collect and annotate multi-modal HRI datasets featuring noisy audio, visual, and sensor signals with ground truth dialogues and environmental noise profiles. 2. Baselines: Standard LLM pipelines without preprocessing, state-of-the-art heuristic denoisers, and fixed parameter equalization modules. 3. Implementation: Develop the adaptive signal processing pipeline integrated with state-of-the-art LLMs and a DRL agent trained via PPO to regulate channel equalization parameters dynamically. 4. Metrics: Evaluate dialogue quality (coherence, relevance, commonsense reasoning), inference latency, computational cost, and error rates under diverse, simulated and real noisy conditions. 5. Evaluation: Test robustness and adaptability by deploying the system in varied real-world dynamic HRI scenarios and measure policy generalization against unseen noise patterns and user behaviors. 6. Ablation: Assess the contribution of DRL optimization versus static equalization and analyze the tradeoff strategies discovered by the agent.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Noisy audio command 'Please hand me the book,' with overlapping background conversations and moderate reverberation. Visual gesture cues supporting object localization are also corrupted by sensor noise. Output after adaptive equalization and LLM processing with DRL-controlled parameters: 'I understand you want the book; I will locate and pick it up now.' The system shows successful noise filtration, maintains commonsense context comprehension, and dynamically adapts signal processing parameters to optimize communication quality in real time.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If DRL-based adaptive equalization control exhibits instability or slower convergence in complex environments, fallback to a supervised learning approach where the equalization module parameters are tuned via offline optimization based on environment clustering. Alternatively, incorporate learned denoising autoencoders fused with classical signal processing as hybrid modules before embedding stages. These options maintain system robustness while simplifying adaptation mechanisms if resources or real-time constraints limit full DRL implementation."

However, the explanation lacks clarity on how these modules interface with the LLM input pipeline, especially considering differences between signal-level processing and high-level semantic embeddings. More details are needed on whether these modules operate on raw sensor signals, audio waveforms, or on the tokenized language inputs, and how the feedback mechanism quantitatively informs channel adaptation parameters in real time. Clarifying these design choices will strengthen the technical soundness of the approach and enable better reproducibility and evaluation design assumptions to be verified rigorously. Please elaborate on the exact signal processing architecture, data flow, and integration points with the LLM components in the final paper or proposal version, including formal definitions or diagrams if feasible to ensure the mechanism is both sound and implementable as described in the hypothesis phase. This clarity is critical, especially given the cross-disciplinary fusion of digital communication theory and language modeling targeted here, which can otherwise cause ambiguity or feasibility misalignment in downstream experiment steps and evaluations.

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the extensive prior art in LLMs and noise robustness, a promising way to further elevate impact and distinguish this work is to integrate deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques from the 'deep reinforcement learning' and 'ambient intelligence' concept clusters to optimize the channel equalization feedback loop dynamically. For example, the system could employ DRL agents to continuously adapt channel parameters based on multi-modal sensor signals and dialogue quality metrics, which would enable more robust policies that generalize across diverse environmental conditions and user behaviors. This would unite the proposed classic communication theory approach with state-of-the-art machine learning strategies in human-computer interaction and smart environments, broadening novelty and potential applicability. Exploring synergy with reinforcement learning algorithms also aligns well with the adaptive goals and may yield superior system efficiency and commonsense dialogue fidelity over manually tuned or purely heuristics-based methods. I suggest adding this direction as either an extension path or a core component, depending on resource availability, to sharpen the scientific contribution and competitive edge.
