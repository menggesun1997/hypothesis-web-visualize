    "title": "Media-Informed Commonsense Knowledge Graph Generation for Multimodal LLMs in HRI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of structured, dynamically updated commonsense knowledge graphs informed by media studies perspectives reduces the richness and contextual relevance of multimodal LLM outputs in HRI.",
    "Motivation": "Calls on the external gap of weak integration of media studies and neural methods by building media-informed commonsense knowledge graphs that fuse communication dynamics insights with multimodal sensory data feeding LLMs, aiming to enrich commonsense knowledge representation for human-robot dialogue and interaction.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a dynamic commonsense knowledge graph leveraging media content analysis techniques (e.g., narrative structures, interaction patterns) to represent contextual and relational commonsense knowledge. Sensor data from HRI settings dynamically update the graph state. The LLM queries this evolving graph during response generation for grounded and context-specific answers. The architecture blends graph neural networks, media analysis pipelines, and LLM conditioning.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Media-rich HRI interaction logs paired with media studies annotations. 2. Evaluate: Dialogue richness, grounding accuracy, commonsense reasoning improvements. 3. Compare: Static knowledge base approaches vs. dynamic media-informed graph approach.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Robot perceives user frustration signals in a multimedia environment. Output: Consults the knowledge graph to generate empathetic and contextually relevant responses acknowledging user's emotional state, informed by media narrative patterns.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If graph updates are slow or inaccurate, precompute graphs offline and use attention mechanisms to weight static commonsense subgraphs. Alternatively, simplify graph structure focusing on core relational triples to reduce complexity."

However, the mechanism by which these heterogeneous components interface remains under-specified, particularly how media studies insights are computationally formalized and fused with sensory data in real-time. Clarify the computational models or algorithms that will extract and represent media narrative structures and interaction patterns, and explicate the process for synchronizing these with sensor updates to maintain graph consistency and relevance during LLM querying. Address potential latency or data mismatch issues in dynamic graph updates to establish robust operational semantics and system-level soundness of the method's pipeline and interaction protocols. Without this, the core technical contribution risks being insufficiently grounded and difficult to implement or reproduce effectively, weakening the overall research soundness and credibility of the proposal. This refinement is critical before progressing to experimentation stages to avoid costly redesigns or non-convergent outcomes in later phases."

Specify the source, scale, and annotation protocol of the 'media-rich HRI interaction logs' dataset to assess accessibility, domain representativeness, and annotation quality, especially for media studies insights which are typically labor-intensive and subjective. Detail quantitative metrics and statistical significance tests for evaluating dialogue richness, grounding accuracy, and commonsense reasoning improvements to ensure measurable and reproducible evaluation. Given the complexity and multimodality, outline the experimental setup for system integration and ablation studies to isolate contributions of media-informed graph components. Also address computational resource requirements and potential scalability challenges in graph updating and LLM querying. Enhancing these experimental design aspects will solidify feasibility and enhance confidence in the validity of results and conclusions derived from the study."
