        "title": "Working Alliance-Informed Adaptive LLM Interpretability for Ethical and Anxiety-Reduced Content Moderation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Users and moderators interacting with opaque large language model (LLM) content moderation outputs frequently experience cognitive anxiety and mistrust, which undermines ethical acceptance and collaboration. Existing interpretability methods inadequately address the dynamic psychological states of users or foster a trusting human-AI relationship, limiting the system's effectiveness and user wellbeing.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the NOV-COMPETITIVE landscape, this proposal distinguishes itself by integrating interdisciplinary insights from psychological signal processing, human-computer interaction (HCI), and clinical communication theories—specifically the concept of the 'working alliance'—to design adaptive interpretability tools that not only reduce user anxiety but also actively foster a progressive trust bond with LLM moderation systems. By dynamically inferring user anxiety through validated behavioral and linguistic signals, and coupling that with transparent communication about uncertainty and privacy, this approach aims to enhance ethical acceptance, user autonomy, and applicability in domains where mental wellbeing and trust are critical, such as healthcare, thereby broadening impact beyond content moderation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose developing an adaptive LLM moderation interpretability framework grounded in the 'working alliance' concept from clinical psychology, aiming to cultivate collaboration and trust between users and the AI system. The system will dynamically infer user anxiety levels by monitoring multimodal behavioral signals—textual interaction markers (e.g., hesitation, correction frequency, lexical indicators of stress), paralinguistic speech features where applicable (e.g., pitch, speech rate), and real-time physiological proxies if available (e.g., heart rate variability via wearable integration). Anxiety inference will be achieved using machine learning models trained on multimodal datasets linking these signals to validated psychological anxiety scales, while ensuring strict user privacy by design and transparent data usage policies. Anxiety metrics will directly modulate interpretability interface adaptations: progressive disclosure of explanations calibrated to user anxiety, empathetic and reassuring explanatory tone leveraging natural language generation tuned to reduce cognitive load, and clear visualization of model uncertainty to increase transparency. Incorporating privacy notices and explicit consent layers will further foster ethical acceptability. The framework will be implemented in an interactive prototype interface that models trust as a dynamic working alliance, progressively building from initial anxiety reduction to user engagement and ethical acceptance.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect and annotate multimodal datasets (textual interaction logs, speech data, optionally physiological signals) in digital content moderation contexts paired with psychological anxiety assessments.\n2. Develop and validate machine learning models for real-time anxiety inference using these signals, benchmarking accuracy and robustness.\n3. Design an adaptive LLM moderation interface integrating anxiety-informed interpretability adjustments (progressive disclosure, empathetic tone, uncertainty visualization) and privacy transparency components.\n4. Conduct within-subject user studies simulating content moderation scenarios comparing (a) static explanations, (b) anxiety-adaptive explanations without working alliance framing, and (c) full working alliance-informed adaptive interpretability.\n5. Measure effects on user anxiety, trust development (modeled as working alliance components), comprehension, ethical acceptance, and user concerns about privacy.\n6. Analyze interactions between anxiety inference accuracy, interface adaptations, and outcomes to iterate on algorithmic and design improvements.\n7. Conduct exploratory evaluation in healthcare-related AI interaction contexts to assess transferability and broaden impact.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1:\nInput: LLM flags a post as borderline hate speech.\nUser behavioral indicators: Increased pause time before response, lexical markers indicating confusion.\nSystem Response: The interface initially offers a concise, gentle explanation using reassuring language and highlights uncertainty about the borderline nature. Upon detecting ongoing anxiety signals, it progressively reveals deeper rationale in user-friendly terms and offers privacy transparency prompts.\nExpected Output: Reduction in user-reported anxiety and increased trust.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: Healthcare chatbot moderation flags a patient query for sensitive content.\nBehavioral signals include speech hesitations and elevated pitch.\nSystem Response: Uses empathetic explanatory tone enhancing the working alliance, clarifies data handling policies explicitly, and gradually builds user confidence with layered explanations.\nExpected Output: Enhanced user collaboration willingness and ethical acceptance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time anxiety inference from multimodal signals proves unreliable or privacy-sensitive, fallback to user self-report mechanisms within the interface to guide adaptive interpretability. Alternatively, implement a static but well-researched simplified explanation template based on clinical communication best practices emphasizing transparency and user autonomy. If trust-building via working alliance framing is insufficient alone, integrate third-party psychological support chatbots to accompany moderation feedback providing reassurance and ethical guidance."

Clarify the specific behavioral signals to be monitored, their measurement modalities, and the underlying models or algorithms for anxiety inference. Explain how these anxiety metrics concretely influence interpretability adjustments (e.g., progressive disclosure or tone changes) within the interface. Solidifying this causal mechanism is critical to establish methodological soundness and justify the expected user impact, ensuring the approach can be rigorously implemented and evaluated as claimed in the experiment plan. This will also aid reproducibility and technical validation of the approach's novelty and effectiveness in anxiety reduction during LLM moderation use cases from the user’s perspective. Consider integrating interdisciplinary insights from psychological signal processing and human-computer interaction literature to support the mechanism design and validation strategy explicitly in your method description and experiments planning stage, focusing on the interaction between anxiety inference and adaptive explanation presentation dynamics for ethical content moderation contexts.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and the interdisciplinary nature of this idea, explicitly incorporate concepts from 'working alliance' and 'human-computer interaction' to strengthen the user-centered design and ethical acceptance framework. For example, leverage the 'working alliance' concept to design interpretability tools that not only reduce anxiety but actively foster a collaborative relationship or trust bond between users and the LLM moderation system. This could include modeling user trust development as a progressive interaction aligned with psychological frameworks in clinician-patient communication. Additionally, integrating user concerns and privacy considerations explicitly—perhaps by addressing transparency about uncertainty and data usage—can boost ethical acceptability and real-world impact. Extending the scope towards healthcare applications or broader user wellbeing contexts where anxiety and trust in AI are critical could broaden the idea’s impact and novelty, positioning it as a cornerstone for ethical NLP systems beyond content moderation. This integration will elevate the research’s theoretical grounding and practical significance while differentiating it within a competitive research space."
