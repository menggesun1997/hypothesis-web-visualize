    "title": "Cultural Commonsense Augmentation via Media-Informed Neural Machine Translation for HRI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Robots struggle to understand and express culturally nuanced commonsense knowledge leading to unnatural or contextually inappropriate human-robot interactions, due to insufficient integration of media studies insights with neural machine translation and multimodal speech recognition.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the external gap identified regarding the weak incorporation of media studies’ communication dynamics into computational models by proposing an interdisciplinary framework combining cultural media analysis with neural machine translation (NMT) for culturally-aware commonsense knowledge in LLM-based HRI systems.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a framework combining a media studies-driven cultural knowledge base with a multimodal speech recognition frontend feeding into a neural machine translation module that maps diverse cultural expressions into a normalized commonsense representation layered atop an LLM. The system enables context-aware translation of cultural idioms, gestures, and speech acts into robot responses tailored for the user's cultural background. Media studies methodologies inform data annotation and cultural context modeling.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Curate cross-cultural HRI datasets with annotated idioms, gestures, speech acts from diverse demographics. 2. Baselines: Conventional LLM without cultural modeling vs. proposed NMT + cultural KB approach. 3. Metrics: Appropriateness of responses, user satisfaction surveys, cross-cultural understanding accuracy. 4. Ablation: Remove cultural knowledge base or NMT step to quantify their contributions.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user says a culturally specific phrase with gesture (e.g., Japanese bowing with 'yoroshiku onegaishimasu'). Output: Robot replies with culturally appropriate, commonsense informed response acknowledging respect and intent rather than a literal translation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cultural data is sparse, generate synthetic cultural interaction examples using transfer learning from related languages/cultures. Alternatively, implement an adaptive user feedback loop to iteratively capture cultural nuances during interactions."

        "title": "Cultural Commonsense Augmentation via Media-Informed Neural Machine Translation and Intelligent Decision-Making for Multimodal HRI",
        "Problem_Statement": "Robots face significant challenges in understanding and generating culturally nuanced commonsense knowledge, leading to interactions that feel unnatural or contextually inappropriate in diverse human-robot interaction (HRI) settings. This is primarily due to insufficient integration of media studies insights, lack of clear technical frameworks for culture-aware normalization in neural machine translation (NMT), and limited real-time adaptation capabilities in multimodal speech and gesture recognition systems.",
        "Motivation": "Despite progress in neural machine translation and large language models, current HRI systems lack transparent, reproducible methods for embedding cultural media dynamics into computational pipelines. Our approach addresses the competitive novelty gap by concretely detailing the integration of interdisciplinary media studies methodologies with machine learning and intelligent decision-making frameworks, yielding a systematic, scalable, and adaptive cultural commonsense augmentation method. This ensures not only richer contextual awareness but also greater robustness and responsiveness in cross-cultural HRI scenarios than prior work.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an end-to-end, modular system architecture comprising: (1) a Media-Informed Cultural Knowledge Base (MICKB), constructed via rigorously defined media studies annotation protocols that encode cultural nuances extracted from multimodal datasets; (2) an Enhanced Multimodal Interface integrating speech recognition and gesture detection that preprocesses input signals into symbolic cultural feature vectors; (3) a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) module augmented with culture-specific embedding layers that normalize diverse cultural expressions into a unified commonsense latent space; (4) a Contextual Commonsense Normalizer that reconciles variant idioms and gestures via media-theoretic semantic alignment, explicitly informed by MICKB; (5) a Large Language Model (LLM) augmented with an Intelligent Decision-Making engine enabling real-time adaptation to user cultural profiles and interaction logs for personalized response generation. We provide clear data flow diagrams and pseudocode to detail inter-module communication and algorithmic operations. The MICKB annotation involves defined schemas and algorithms derived from media studies frameworks, ensuring reproducibility and integrative cultural context modeling. During live HRI, the system continually updates cultural state estimates using reinforcement learning and feedback, achieving dynamic real-time cultural alignment.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset Collection & Annotation: Collaborate with media studies experts to define annotation guidelines for cross-cultural idioms, gestures, and speech acts; curate a multimodal HRI dataset across at least 3 diverse cultures; employ crowdsourcing augmented by expert review for scalability and consistency. 2. Data Augmentation: Generate synthetic cultural interaction data via conditional transfer learning and style transfer from related cultures to alleviate sparsity. 3. Benchmark Tasks: Develop standardized simulation environments and benchmark interaction scenarios focusing on culturally sensitive response appropriateness and commonsense interpretation. 4. Baselines: Compare proposed method to (a) LLM only, (b) LLM+NMT without cultural knowledge base, (c) ablated systems removing Intelligent Decision-Making layers. 5. Metrics: Combine objective measures including cross-cultural semantic alignment score, response appropriateness (via expert raters), and user satisfaction measured by validated Likert-scale surveys with defined anchors. Employ statistical significance testing (ANOVA with post-hoc analyses) for rigor. 6. Timeline and Resources: Outline 12-month project with milestones for annotation schema development (3 months), dataset curation (3 months), model training and integration (4 months), and evaluation (2 months). Allocate human resources accordingly.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input Example: User performs a Japanese bow accompanied by the phrase 'yoroshiku onegaishimasu.' The Enhanced Multimodal Interface extracts gesture features and speech tokens, passes them to NMT for normalization into a commonsense representation of respect and cooperative intent. The Intelligent Decision-Making engine cross-references cultural profile and interaction history, enabling the LLM to generate the response: 'I appreciate your kind greeting. I look forward to assisting you respectfully.' This response reflects a culturally sensitive understanding beyond literal translation. Additional test cases include greetings, humor, and taboo-avoidance scenarios tailored to multiple cultures.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "To address potential data sparsity, we integrate synthetic data augmentation via style transfer and domain adaptation from linguistically or culturally related domains. If initial annotations prove inconsistent, we implement iterative annotation cycles with quality control and active learning to focus expert effort on high-uncertainty samples. In absence of rich prior cultural data, the system uses adaptive online learning driven by real-time user feedback through reinforcement learning, progressively refining cultural commonsense models and user profiles. This ensures continuous improvement even under limited initial resources."

For instance, the mechanism by which media studies methodologies inform data annotation and cultural context modeling is not concretely specified. How the system normalizes diverse cultural expressions into a unified commonsense representation, and how this interacts with the LLM, requires elaboration. Providing a clear end-to-end system architecture or pipeline with algorithmic modules and their interfaces would greatly strengthen the soundness and reproducibility of the method. Clarify the interaction between components and the data flow, especially how cultural nuances are integrated and utilized in real-time HRI scenarios. This will enhance confidence in the proposed method’s validity and implementation feasibility. Suggestions: include pseudo-code, model diagrams, or examples illustrating these mechanisms in detail to remove ambiguity and demonstrate technical viability. Target section: Proposed_Method"

For example, the curation of rich, cross-cultural HRI datasets with annotated idioms, gestures, and speech acts from diverse demographics is very resource-intensive and may suffer data sparsity. Additionally, how the annotation process incorporates media studies methodologies is unclear, which poses reproducibility and quality risks. Evaluation metrics such as user satisfaction surveys and appropriateness are subjective and require rigorous definition and scaling. The ablation study plans are promising but need detailed descriptions about experimental controls and statistical significance tests to ensure scientific rigor. To improve feasibility, the plan should explicitly consider dataset augmentation strategies, annotation guidelines rooted in media studies, and define benchmark tasks or simulation environments. Providing a timeline and resource estimates would also help. Target section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
