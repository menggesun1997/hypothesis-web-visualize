    "Problem_Statement": "Scalability of continual learning in LLMs remains challenged by computational costs and abstract theoretical models lacking operational heuristics for efficient real-time world knowledge updating.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the gap of absent computational frameworks by marrying cognitive science paradigms of prediction/action with new heuristic algorithms that smartly approximate knowledge updates, balancing theoretical abstraction with scalable application.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a heuristic-driven continual learning framework inspired by predictive processing theories, implementing sparse update triggers based on surprise and prediction error signals. Integrate reinforcement schedules modeled after cognitive action selection to prioritize resource allocation, enabling large-scale, real-time knowledge updating with minimal computational overhead.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Design prediction-error-based heuristics to identify knowledge update necessity.\n2) Implement sparse update modules within existing LLM architectures.\n3) Train on streaming world knowledge datasets (e.g., news, scientific publications).\n4) Benchmark against standard continual learning baselines on update efficiency and accuracy.\n5) Perform ablation studies isolating heuristic components.\n6) Validate on real-time query tasks requiring updated knowledge.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Continuous feed of scientific facts with sudden breakthrough discovery.\nOutput: Model selectively updates knowledge relevant to the breakthrough without large-scale retraining, maintaining stable performance on unaffected topics.\nExample: Not updating unrelated domains despite high-volume incoming data, thus saving computation and enhancing efficiency.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If heuristic triggers miss critical updates, incorporate lightweight meta-learning to refine trigger thresholds dynamically. Alternatively, combine with small episodic memory buffers capturing key knowledge samples for fallback updates."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method's description of leveraging predictive processing theories and cognitive action selection to create heuristic trigger signals is conceptually promising but lacks critical specificity. For example, the exact nature of surprise and prediction error signals, how they are quantified within LLM architectures, and how reinforcement schedules concretely modulate resource allocation are not clearly defined. Providing a more formalized characterization or computational pseudocode of these heuristics would strengthen the mechanism's clarity and validate its plausibility before implementation. Consider integrating or referencing existing computational models of predictive processing to ground these heuristics rigorously within LLM continual learning contexts, which will aid both reproducibility and scientific rigor, addressing soundness concerns in mechanism design effectively. This clarity is crucial given the complex interplay of cognitive-inspired signals within large-scale neural systems to ensure trustworthy, interpretable triggers for updating knowledge at scale in real time without excessive computation overheads. The paper must explicitly detail these operationalizations to move beyond high-level conceptual alignment toward actionable algorithmic procedures and better justify the methodological soundness of this hybrid approach in subsequent sections like Experiment_Plan and Test_Case_Examples, increasing confidence in the research idea's technical feasibility and scientific merit as a novel heuristic continual learning framework for LLMs with scalability benefits over existing baselines.  \n\n---\n\n[This feedback addresses the core soundness issue impacting the foundation of the proposed solution and should be remedied prior to empirical validation.]  \n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty screening result as NOV-COMPETITIVE, it is advisable to integrate the established 'framework of meta-learning' to enhance both the novelty and practical adaptability of the proposed heuristics. Specifically, framing the heuristic trigger threshold adaptation within a meta-learning paradigm would allow dynamic refinement of the surprise and prediction error signals over time, guided by episodic feedback from continuous learning performance. This could be realized by embedding lightweight meta-learners to optimize heuristic parameters or trigger policies based on feedback from knowledge updating outcomes, thus systematically improving update precision and reducing false negatives/positives in triggers. This approach would also align well with the fallback plan involving lightweight meta-learning, providing a unified conceptual framework that better contextualizes and strengthens the methodological foundation. By explicitly incorporating meta-learning mechanisms, the research can leverage well-studied optimization techniques for rapid adaptation to non-stationary data streams while overcoming the challenge of heuristic brittleness and trigger efficacy â€” a known difficulty in heuristic-based continual learning systems. Moreover, this integration can widen the method's applicability and appeal, maximizing the impact of the contribution in the competitive continual learning domain by positioning it as a hybrid cognitive-computational-metacognitive framework for scalable knowledge updating, rather than a heuristic-only solution. Explicitly detailing this meta-learning synergy and embedding it in the experimental design will also help to delineate clearer performance improvement pathways beyond baseline heuristic designs.  \n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
