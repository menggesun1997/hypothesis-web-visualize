    "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Reader's Guide Embedding for Psychological Context in LLM Moderation",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM moderation lacks incorporation of fine-grained psychological and clinical interpretation guides derived from communication research, limiting nuanced bias detection and world knowledge encoding comprehension.",
    "Motivation": "Fulfills the external critical gap by embedding 'Reader’s Guide' themes from communication research, enriched with biomedical and psychological interpretation schemas, into LLM architectures to enhance moderation interpretability and ethical bias assessment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct embedding modules capturing psychological constructs (e.g., cognitive load, interpretive frames) and Reader’s Guide thematic annotations, integrating these embeddings into LLM input representations via adapter layers. The model jointly optimizes to leverage these psychological contexts for improved ethical moderation and bias sensitivity.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Digitize and structure Reader’s Guide themes with psychological annotations.\n2. Develop embedding adapters and integrate into pretrained LLMs.\n3. Fine-tune on social media moderation datasets with psychological interpretative labels.\n4. Evaluate improvement in bias detection metrics and interpretability.\n5. Conduct user studies to validate human-alignment of moderation rationales.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Ambiguous social media narrative requiring contextual psychological interpretation.\nExpected Output: Moderation decision reflecting nuanced bias detection informed by embedded Reader’s Guide psychological themes.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If embedding adaptation yields modest improvement, fallback to multi-task learning paradigms combining clinical communication classification with moderation or utilize external interpretative modules in pipeline architecture."

          "feedback_content": "While the Proposed_Method outlines embedding psychological constructs through adapter layers in LLMs, the explanation lacks clarity on how these embeddings concretely influence the moderation decision process. The narrative would benefit from a more detailed mechanistic description of how the psychological Reader's Guide themes interplay with LLM internal representations to improve bias detection and interpretability. Specifically, clarifying whether these embeddings alter attention mechanisms, augment token representations, or guide output calibration would strengthen the soundness of the approach. Incorporate pseudocode or diagrams in future drafts to concretely illustrate this mechanism and justify its validity based on prior work in adapter fusion or psychological embedding integration techniques. This would help reviewers understand how the psychological context is operationalized rather than conceptually assumed, thus improving the internal reasoning soundness of the method section."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and the globally linked concepts of 'commonsense reasoning', 'organizational behavior', and 'organizational structure', an impactful enhancement would be to extend the embedding architecture to incorporate commonsense reasoning modules. These modules could provide the LLM with a richer context for human communication nuances, anchoring psychological frames in broader social and organizational contexts. For instance, integrating commonsense knowledge about organizational behavior and communication hierarchies could enhance bias detection subtlety, especially in social media moderation scenarios involving group dynamics or structural biases. This cross-disciplinary fusion would distinguishedly position your work by adding a layered interpretative schema that goes beyond psychological annotations alone. Explicitly propose such integration either as an extension of adapter layers or as additional multi-task learning signals to increase novelty and broaden impact."
