        "title": "Neuroadaptive Continual Learning via ERP-Guided Feedback Loops",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current continual learning techniques for LLMs lack integration of neurocognitive signals that could offer real-time indicators of model prediction confidence and error, limiting adaptability in breaking knowledge shifts.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of bridging predictive brain theory with scalable learning mechanisms by incorporating event-related potentials (ERP) from neuroscience as feedback signals to guide knowledge updating; exploits hidden bridge between predictive brain and neurocognitive metrics revealed in global GPS analysis.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a continual learning framework where the LLM's outputs are augmented with simulated ERP-inspired confidence signals derived from internal attention and activation patterns. These signals will feed into a meta-controller that dynamically adjusts learning rates and update priorities. We will design a neural module inspired by mental state attribution models that predicts the model's own error likelihood and guides knowledge integration.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets with time-sequenced knowledge updates (e.g., Wikipedia snapshots).\n2) Train baseline continual learning LLMs on these data.\n3) Implement ERP-inspired signal generation module from internal activations.\n4) Train meta-controller using reinforcement learning to optimize update decisions.\n5) Evaluate on knowledge retention, update speed, and prediction accuracy metrics.\n6) Compare with standard continual learning baselines.\n7) Perform ablation testing of ERP signal components.",

        "Fallback_Plan": "If simulated ERP signals do not improve adaptability, revert to direct uncertainty quantification from model probabilities or attention entropy. Alternatively, use externally collected EEG-ERP datasets to pretrain meta-controllers before integration."

        "title": "Embodied Predictive Feedback Loops for Dynamic Knowledge Refinement in LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM continual learning algorithms rarely incorporate embodied predictive models or dynamic user feedback loops comprehensively, leading to siloed and inefficient knowledge updates.",
        "Motivation": "Directly addresses the gap of disconnect between predictive brain-inspired embodied cognition frameworks and technological feedback loops (book reviews, community evaluation) to create a hybrid continual learning architecture enabling interactive and context-sensitive knowledge updating.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a two-tier system combining an embodied predictive model that simulates environmental interaction states and a user feedback-driven knowledge evaluation loop. The embodied model predicts knowledge relevancy shifts based on sensory-like inputs (news streams, user queries), while the feedback loop uses real-time community evaluations ('book reviews') to score and refine knowledge update quality, integrating these scores dynamically into the LLM update process.",

        "Fallback_Plan": "If embodied prediction and feedback loop coupling is unstable, decouple system components and optimize separately; alternatively, explore semi-supervised learning to incorporate user signals more gradually."

        "Proposed_Method": "Create a continual learning architecture that monitors incremental prediction error signals via simulated ERPs computed from intermediate representations. This method leverages cross-modal embeddings from textual and virtual sensory inputs to predict neurocognitive markers representing learning difficulty, adjusting update strength accordingly. Incorporate mental state attribution-inspired modules to estimate model uncertainty and context alignment during updates.",

Use curriculum learning with adaptive information complexity schedules and incorporate meta-cognitive control modules emulating human attentional and memory mechanisms to regulate knowledge integration and retrieval.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Create staged datasets modeling incremental language complexity and domain shift.\n2) Train baseline LLM continual learners.\n3) Implement curriculum schedules inspired by language acquisition theories.\n4) Add meta-cognitive regulation modules controlling plasticity.\n5) Evaluate retention, transfer learning, and robustness to noisy input.\n6) Compare to vanilla continual learning methods.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Incremental exposure to technical jargon and morphological variants in a new domain.\nExpected output: Smooth incremental knowledge representation growth with minimal catastrophic forgetting and improved generalization on downstream tasks.",
