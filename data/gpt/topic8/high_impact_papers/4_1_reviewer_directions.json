    "title": "Implementation Science-Guided Participatory Dataset Curation for Ethical LLM Moderation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Dataset curation and fine-tuning for LLMs in social media moderation lack systematic, ethically-grounded participatory frameworks that align with diverse stakeholder values, risking perpetuation or amplification of unseen biases.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to the internal gaps by leveraging implementation science methodologies and health communication qualitative research criteria to create a participatory framework that directly integrates stakeholder input into dataset development, ensuring ethical oversight and value alignment beyond technical fixes.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-phase participatory framework involving: (1) stakeholder mapping (content creators, moderators, affected communities); (2) design and deployment of iterative qualitative workshops to identify sensitive bias areas; (3) co-curation of datasets with stakeholder annotation and value-sensitive adjustments; (4) continuous feedback-enabled fine-tuning pipelines that integrate qualitative insights with quantitative performance metrics.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Identify diverse social media communities and moderator groups.\n2. Conduct qualitative interviews and workshops to gather bias concerns.\n3. Collect social media datasets annotated with participatory guidelines.\n4. Fine-tune LLMs on curated datasets.\n5. Evaluate with standard NLP metrics and novel ethical alignment metrics reflecting stakeholder satisfaction.\n6. Iterate cycles of feedback and refinement.\n7. Compare with standard dataset curation to quantify ethical and performance improvements.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Posts from a marginalized community flagged by standard LLM moderation as toxic.\nExpected Output: Participatory re-annotated labels reducing false positives, leading to fine-tuned models respecting community discourse norms ethically.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If participatory datasets are insufficient, fallback to synthetic data augmentation guided by stakeholder-elicited ethical rules or integrating expert-in-the-loop annotation to supplement participatory gaps."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a multi-phase participatory framework that relies heavily on qualitative workshops and stakeholder annotations to identify and mitigate biases. However, the mechanism by which qualitative insights will be systematically integrated with quantitative fine-tuning pipelines is not sufficiently detailed. Specifically, how qualitative feedback and value-sensitive adjustments quantitatively influence model updates remains unclear, which undermines the soundness and reproducibility of the approach. It is recommended to clearly define methods for converting qualitative stakeholder inputs into model features, loss functions, or parameter adjustments to strengthen the conceptual clarity and scientific rigor of the method component, ensuring the interplay between qualitative and quantitative stages is concrete and well-justified. This clarification will improve confidence in the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach as a whole. (Target Section: Proposed_Method)\"} ,{\"feedback_code\":\"FEA-EXPERIMENT\",\"feedback_content\":\"The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan proposes qualitative workshops, dataset curation, and iterative fine-tuning cycles followed by evaluation with both conventional and novel ethical alignment metrics. While promising, feasibility concerns arise regarding the scalability and diversity of stakeholder engagement: identifying and recruiting sufficiently diverse communities and moderators, conducting multiple iterative qualitative workshops, and collecting a participatory annotated dataset could be resource- and time-intensive, potentially limiting representativeness. The plan also omits detailed risk management for incomplete or biased stakeholder participation and does not specify concrete criteria or protocols for the novel ethical alignment metrics. To improve feasibility, the experiment plan should include explicit strategies for scaling stakeholder involvement across diverse demographics, protocols for ethical metric validation, and contingency plans beyond synthetic data augmentation — such as expert panel validation — to ensure robust dataset creation. This will increase the practical viability of the research in real-world settings. (Target Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)\"}]}"
