    "title": "Ethical Oversight Dashboard Using Implementation Science for LLM Social Media Datasets",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is an absence of systematic ethical oversight tools integrating stakeholder feedback and implementation science principles during iterative dataset curation impacting transparent, ethical LLM development for moderation.",
    "Motivation": "Builds from Opportunity 2's call for implementation science-guided frameworks by proposing a real-time, participatory ethical oversight dashboard that tracks dataset curation activities, metrics, and stakeholder concerns, operationalizing ethical standards in LLM dataset development.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a dashboard platform that incorporates implementation science frameworks and consolidated qualitative research criteria to monitor dataset composition, annotation bias indicators, environmental costs, and ethical compliance. The tool supports stakeholder input collection, version-tracking, and impact visualization enabling transparent dataset governance aligned with ethical approval workflows.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Establish key ethical metrics based on literature and stakeholder interviews.\n2. Design dashboard interface and backend data ingestion pipelines.\n3. Pilot the dashboard in ongoing social media dataset curation projects.\n4. Evaluate impact through surveys, auditing dataset bias statistics pre- and post- intervention.\n5. Iterate based on user feedback and broaden adoption efforts.\n6. Assess correlations with improved moderation model ethical outcomes.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Real-time feed of dataset annotations showing emerging bias skew.\nExpected Output: Dashboard alerts and visualizations prompting curator interventions informed by stakeholder values.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If dashboard adoption is limited, fallback to lightweight report modules or integration into existing dataset platforms with automated ethical risk flagging without active stakeholder interface."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section introduces the use of implementation science frameworks and qualitative research criteria to monitor diverse ethical and bias indicators, but it lacks a clear, detailed description of how these components concretely integrate within the dashboard architecture. Specifically, the mechanisms by which real-time data ingestion, bias detection algorithms, and stakeholder inputs converge and how ethical compliance is quantified or operationalized remain underdefined. This impedes confidence in the method's internal coherence and functional viability. To improve, provide a detailed schematic or workflow demonstrating data flow, stakeholder feedback incorporation, and how alerts or metrics are generated and validated to ensure the dashboard's sound functioning as an ethical oversight tool. Clarify algorithmic or analytical techniques employed to assess annotation bias and environmental costs as well as the linkage to ethical standards enforcement workflows to strengthen this critical mechanism explanation within the Proposed_Method section and increase the idea’s soundness and clarity."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a sensible progression from metric establishment through rollout and evaluation but lacks clarity on concrete evaluation criteria, statistical rigor, and scalability assessment for the dashboard’s real-world deployment. For instance, the plan mentions surveys and bias statistics auditing but does not specify precise evaluation metrics, sample sizes, control conditions, or how ethical outcomes of moderation models will be quantitatively or qualitatively measured. Additionally, the feasibility of integrating multi-stakeholder input processes and complex implementation science frameworks into existing curation workflows is not addressed. To enhance feasibility confidence, incorporate detailed experimental design elements such as: defining quantifiable metrics for ethical compliance improvement, planned statistical tests, benchmarks for user adoption rates, timeline contingencies, and fallback strategy implementation. Explicating these details will allow for a more scientifically sound, practical testing phase framework and better gauge the method’s real-world viability."
