        "title": "Implementation Science-Guided Participatory Dataset Curation with Quantitative Integration and Scalable Ethical Validation for Trustworthy LLM Moderation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current dataset curation and fine-tuning methodologies for LLMs intended for social media moderation often lack systematic, ethically-grounded, and scalable participatory frameworks that effectively integrate diverse stakeholder values. This absence risks perpetuating or amplifying hidden biases, undermining AI trustworthiness and inclusivity in moderation outcomes.",
        "Motivation": "While prior approaches incorporate participatory annotation or qualitative workshops, they often fall short on clearly connecting stakeholder qualitative insights with rigorous quantitative model fine-tuning and fail to address scalability and robustness of stakeholder engagement and ethical evaluation. Our proposal innovates by embedding implementation science principles into a comprehensive, participatory, and reproducible framework that combines qualitative inputs with concrete quantitative model adjustments. Furthermore, we integrate concepts from data governance and AI trustworthiness to establish transparent, scalable protocols for stakeholder engagement and ethical metric validation. This synergy offers a fundamentally novel methodology that transcends prior work by harmonizing value-sensitive design with reproducible machine learning pipelines for impactful ethical LLM moderation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-phase, implementation science-guided framework integrating participatory and quantitative elements through the following mechanisms: 1) Stakeholder Mapping and Data Governance Setup: Identify diverse communities (content creators, moderators, vulnerable groups) and establish a transparent data governance framework ensuring ethical data stewardship and participant trust. 2) Iterative Qualitative Workshops: Conduct facilitated workshops and semi-structured interviews to elicit nuanced bias concerns and value priorities. 3) Qualitative-to-Quantitative Translation: Develop systematic methods to encode qualitative insights into model features, custom loss functions, and parameter regularizations (e.g., bias-sensitive penalties, fairness constraints), operationalized via interpretable annotation schemas and mapping protocols. 4) Participatory Dataset Co-Curation: Collaborate with stakeholders to annotate datasets guided by these encodings, overseen by an expert panel that validates annotations’ consistency and alignment with ethical norms. 5) Scalable Engagement Strategy: Employ mixed modes (in-person, digital platforms) and stratified sampling to ensure demographic representativeness and mitigate participation bias; use engagement analytics for ongoing quality control. 6) Fine-tuning Pipelines with Feedback Loops: Integrate stakeholder-driven quantitative loss functions into iterative fine-tuning procedures alongside conventional NLP objectives. 7) Ethical Alignment Metrics: Design, validate, and deploy multi-dimensional ethical metrics (including stakeholder satisfaction surveys, fairness disparity indices, and robustness measures) following rigorous psychometric protocols. 8) Continuous Monitoring and Refinement: Institutionalize processes for ongoing stakeholder feedback incorporation, model auditing, and data governance compliance. This combined approach operationalizes qualitative-to-quantitative integration concretely and ensures reproducibility, robustness, and scalability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble a diverse panel of stakeholders representing at-risk and mainstream social media communities; define and implement a data governance framework aligned with AI trustworthiness best practices.\n2. Conduct iterative qualitative workshops and interviews to identify context-specific bias and ethical concerns.\n3. Systematically translate qualitative data into formal annotation guidelines, loss function designs, and model constraints with expert panel validation.\n4. Co-curate a representative participatory dataset with stakeholder annotations, applying stratified recruitment and digital engagement tools to enhance scalability and diversity.\n5. Fine-tune LLM moderation models integrating stakeholder-informed loss functions alongside standard objectives.\n6. Define and validate ethical alignment metrics via psychometric validation and stakeholder feedback loops.\n7. Evaluate models using standard NLP metrics and these novel ethical metrics; conduct comparative analyses against baseline models without participatory integration.\n8. Implement continuous monitoring protocols to iteratively refine datasets and models based on ongoing stakeholder engagement and metric performance.\n9. Establish fallback protocols including expert panel augmentation and synthetic data synthesis if stakeholder participation is incomplete or biased, monitored through governance and quality-control dashboards.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Social media posts from marginalized communities frequently misclassified as toxic under standard moderation pipelines.\nExpected Output: Participatory re-annotated labels that incorporate stakeholder contextual insights, resulting in fine-tuned models with reduced false positive rates and improved fairness across demographic groups; measurable gains in ethical alignment metrics and stakeholder satisfaction scores.\nAdditional: Use engagement platform analytics to demonstrate equitable participation; expert panel assessments confirming annotation quality and ethical metric validity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If stakeholder participation proves insufficient or biased despite scaling strategies, fallback plans include: (1) Expert panel augmentation to review and refine annotations and model constraints, ensuring continued ethical oversight; (2) Synthetic data augmentation guided by stakeholder-elicited ethical rules and expert knowledge to simulate underrepresented perspectives; (3) Deployment of adaptive engagement protocols leveraging digital tools and incentives to enhance participation; (4) Implementation of robust data governance monitoring dashboards to detect and address participation gaps rapidly—thus maintaining dataset robustness and model fairness despite engagement challenges."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a multi-phase participatory framework that relies heavily on qualitative workshops and stakeholder annotations to identify and mitigate biases. However, the mechanism by which qualitative insights will be systematically integrated with quantitative fine-tuning pipelines is not sufficiently detailed. Specifically, how qualitative feedback and value-sensitive adjustments quantitatively influence model updates remains unclear, which undermines the soundness and reproducibility of the approach. It is recommended to clearly define methods for converting qualitative stakeholder inputs into model features, loss functions, or parameter adjustments to strengthen the conceptual clarity and scientific rigor of the method component, ensuring the interplay between qualitative and quantitative stages is concrete and well-justified. This clarification will improve confidence in the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach as a whole. (Target Section: Proposed_Method)\"} ,{\"feedback_code\":\"FEA-EXPERIMENT\",\"feedback_content\":\"The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan proposes qualitative workshops, dataset curation, and iterative fine-tuning cycles followed by evaluation with both conventional and novel ethical alignment metrics. While promising, feasibility concerns arise regarding the scalability and diversity of stakeholder engagement: identifying and recruiting sufficiently diverse communities and moderators, conducting multiple iterative qualitative workshops, and collecting a participatory annotated dataset could be resource- and time-intensive, potentially limiting representativeness. The plan also omits detailed risk management for incomplete or biased stakeholder participation and does not specify concrete criteria or protocols for the novel ethical alignment metrics. To improve feasibility, the experiment plan should include explicit strategies for scaling stakeholder involvement across diverse demographics, protocols for ethical metric validation, and contingency plans beyond synthetic data augmentation — such as expert panel validation — to ensure robust dataset creation. This will increase the practical viability of the research in real-world settings. (Target Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)\"}]}"
