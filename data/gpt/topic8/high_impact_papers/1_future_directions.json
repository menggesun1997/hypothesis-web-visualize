        "title": "Unified Multi-Modal Commonsense Fusion via U-Net Guided LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language models (LLMs) struggle to effectively incorporate multimodal commonsense knowledge, particularly under hardware constraints and within dynamic human-robot interaction (HRI) contexts. This limits the naturalness and adaptability of robot communication with humans.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient multi-modal grounding in LLMs for nuanced HRI by leveraging the innovation opportunity of applying U-Net architectures from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to fuse multimodal sensory data with language models, enhancing context awareness and commonsense integration.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design an integrated model where visual and audio sensor inputs are processed through a U-Net inspired CNN to generate semantic embeddings that dynamically condition the LLM generation process. The U-Net decoder features enable restoration and emphasis of relevant multimodal context cues. The language model is fine-tuned with these aligned embeddings to produce context-aware responses. The architecture is optimized for low-latency hardware deployment via pruning and quantization techniques.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Collect a multimodal HRI dataset including video, audio, and corresponding human-robot dialogue with annotated commonsense aspects. 2. Baselines: Compare to standard LLM-only methods and multimodal fusion using concatenation or attention without U-Net. 3. Metrics: Use dialogue coherence, context relevance, commonsense reasoning accuracy, and latency on embedded hardware. 4. Ablations: Test effect of various U-Net depths and conditioning methods on performance.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Video of a human holding a cup and saying 'Could you get me some water?' Output: Robot response 'I see you have a cup, I will get water to fill it.' This demonstrates multimodal visual grounding (cup) enriching language understanding via the U-Net conditioned LLM.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct U-Net conditioning underperforms, try hierarchical multimodal embedding models merging at transformer layers. Alternatively, employ knowledge distillation from larger multimodal teacher models or simulate hardware constraints in training to increase model robustness."

        "title": "Channel-Equalized Commonsense Dialogue for Real-Time HRI",
        "Problem_Statement": "Real-time human-robot communication using LLMs is limited by computational overhead and communication noise, which degrade commonsense knowledge integration and response quality under dynamic environments.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the external gap of underexploited channel estimation and equalization techniques from classical communication theory to improve robustness and efficiency in LLM-driven, real-time HRI systems, corresponding to opportunity 2 in the landscape map.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Incorporate adaptive channel estimation and equalization modules inspired by communication theory before language model processing. These modules denoise, compress, and adaptively filter sensor and dialogue signals ensuring that the LLM receives clearer contextual inputs. Additionally, propose a feedback mechanism where the LLM's output quality metrics inform channel adaptation parameters dynamically, balancing computational efficiency and commonsense reasoning fidelity.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Use real noisy HRI communication logs with accompanying sensor noise profiles. 2. Baselines: Standard LLM pipelines without channel equalization, state-of-the-art denoisers. 3. Metrics: Dialogue quality, inference latency, computational cost, and error rates under varying noise conditions. 4. Evaluation: Test adaptability under simulated channel noise and hardware constraints.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Audio command with background noise 'Please hand me the book.' Output after equalization and LLM: 'I understand you want the book; I will pick it up now.' Demonstrates noise filtering and maintained commonsense context comprehension.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If feedback-adaptive equalization shows instability, fallback to fixed equalization parameters tuned per environment. Alternatively, replace digital signal processing modules with learned denoising autoencoders integrated before LLM input embedding stages."

        "title": "Cultural Commonsense Augmentation via Media-Informed Neural Machine Translation for HRI",
        "Problem_Statement": "Robots struggle to understand and express culturally nuanced commonsense knowledge leading to unnatural or contextually inappropriate human-robot interactions, due to insufficient integration of media studies insights with neural machine translation and multimodal speech recognition.",
        "Motivation": "Fills the external gap identified regarding the weak incorporation of media studiesâ€™ communication dynamics into computational models by proposing an interdisciplinary framework combining cultural media analysis with neural machine translation (NMT) for culturally-aware commonsense knowledge in LLM-based HRI systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a framework combining a media studies-driven cultural knowledge base with a multimodal speech recognition frontend feeding into a neural machine translation module that maps diverse cultural expressions into a normalized commonsense representation layered atop an LLM. The system enables context-aware translation of cultural idioms, gestures, and speech acts into robot responses tailored for the user's cultural background. Media studies methodologies inform data annotation and cultural context modeling.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Curate cross-cultural HRI datasets with annotated idioms, gestures, speech acts from diverse demographics. 2. Baselines: Conventional LLM without cultural modeling vs. proposed NMT + cultural KB approach. 3. Metrics: Appropriateness of responses, user satisfaction surveys, cross-cultural understanding accuracy. 4. Ablation: Remove cultural knowledge base or NMT step to quantify their contributions.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user says a culturally specific phrase with gesture (e.g., Japanese bowing with 'yoroshiku onegaishimasu'). Output: Robot replies with culturally appropriate, commonsense informed response acknowledging respect and intent rather than a literal translation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If cultural data is sparse, generate synthetic cultural interaction examples using transfer learning from related languages/cultures. Alternatively, implement an adaptive user feedback loop to iteratively capture cultural nuances during interactions."

        "title": "Hierarchical U-Net-Led Multimodal Commonsense Reasoning Backbone for Embodied Agents",
        "Problem_Statement": "Embodied agents lack a hierarchical mechanism to integrate complex multimodal commonsense signals dynamically, limiting their interactive understanding and adaptability in real-world HRI contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of bridging communication theory and neural methods by innovatively adapting hierarchical U-Net CNN architectures to decompose and reconstruct multimodal signals for commonsense reasoning within LLM-based embodied agents, advancing opportunity 1.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a multi-level U-Net architecture that separately processes raw sensory modalities (vision, audio, tactile) into layered semantic embeddings. These embeddings feed into corresponding hierarchical transformer layers of an LLM, enabling the agent to reason at different abstraction levels simultaneously. Skip connections fuse low-level cues with high-level semantics. The model is trained end-to-end on commonsense reasoning tasks involving dynamic multimodal inputs in HRI.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect a multimodal HRI dataset covering sensor fusion and commonsense interaction tasks. 2. Train U-Net encoders jointly with an LLM transformer backbone. 3. Compare against flat multimodal fusion models. 4. Evaluate on commonsense reasoning benchmarks adapted for embodiment and interaction quality metrics.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Video of a person dropping an object with audio feedback (crash) and tactile sensor triggers. Output: Robot interprets event correctly as accidental dropping and offers assistance or verbal reassurance contextually.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If joint training is unstable, pre-train U-Net modules separately for modal feature extraction before fine-tuning transformers. Alternatively, experiment with attention-based fusion layers replacing skip connections."

        "title": "Cross-Domain Commonsense Adaptation via Channel-Aware Neural Translation for Robot Dialogue",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current HRI dialogue systems fail to adapt commonsense knowledge effectively across domains due to communication noise and lack of integrated channel-aware processing tied to language translation and reasoning.",
        "Motivation": "Bridges external gaps related to communication research and neural nets by combining channel estimation algorithms with neural machine translation techniques focused on cross-domain commonsense adaptation during human-robot dialogues, expanding on innovation opportunity 2.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a channel-awareness module that estimates data reliability and context drift during ongoing dialogue transmission, feeding into a neural machine translation network that adapts commonsense representations dynamically according to detected environmental and communicative channel states. This enables the robot to maintain coherent, commonsense dialogue even when switching contexts or domains during interaction.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Simulate dialogue datasets with domain switches and communication noise. 2. Baselines: Non-adaptive NMT and LLM systems. 3. Metrics: Dialogue coherence, context retention, commonsense integrity under channel perturbations. 4. Perform user studies to assess perceived naturalness and adaptability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User abruptly changes topic from cooking to gardening with background noise. Output: Robot adapts response maintaining commonsense understanding relevant to gardening, despite noisy channel.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If channel estimations are noisy, use confidence-based rejection mechanisms or fallback to previous stable dialogue states. Alternatively, incorporate reinforcement learning to optimize channel adaptation policies."

        "title": "Media-Informed Commonsense Knowledge Graph Generation for Multimodal LLMs in HRI",
        "Problem_Statement": "Lack of structured, dynamically updated commonsense knowledge graphs informed by media studies perspectives reduces the richness and contextual relevance of multimodal LLM outputs in HRI.",
        "Motivation": "Calls on the external gap of weak integration of media studies and neural methods by building media-informed commonsense knowledge graphs that fuse communication dynamics insights with multimodal sensory data feeding LLMs, aiming to enrich commonsense knowledge representation for human-robot dialogue and interaction.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a dynamic commonsense knowledge graph leveraging media content analysis techniques (e.g., narrative structures, interaction patterns) to represent contextual and relational commonsense knowledge. Sensor data from HRI settings dynamically update the graph state. The LLM queries this evolving graph during response generation for grounded and context-specific answers. The architecture blends graph neural networks, media analysis pipelines, and LLM conditioning.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Media-rich HRI interaction logs paired with media studies annotations. 2. Evaluate: Dialogue richness, grounding accuracy, commonsense reasoning improvements. 3. Compare: Static knowledge base approaches vs. dynamic media-informed graph approach.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Robot perceives user frustration signals in a multimedia environment. Output: Consults the knowledge graph to generate empathetic and contextually relevant responses acknowledging user's emotional state, informed by media narrative patterns.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If graph updates are slow or inaccurate, precompute graphs offline and use attention mechanisms to weight static commonsense subgraphs. Alternatively, simplify graph structure focusing on core relational triples to reduce complexity."
