        "title": "Neuropsychological Benchmarking for Continual Learning in LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current continual learning techniques in large language models (LLMs) lack robust, human-inspired validation frameworks, limiting their real-world adaptability and trustworthiness.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses internal and external critical gaps by bridging cognitive predictive paradigms with neuropsychological assessment methods, specifically leveraging performance validity tests used in mild traumatic brain injury studies to create novel, empirically grounded benchmarks for continual learning in LLMs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a benchmarking suite for continual learning algorithms inspired by neuropsychological performance validity tests. This suite simulates cognitive task performance with built-in stressors and perturbations to evaluate LLMs' ability to maintain adaptive knowledge updating resiliently. The method involves translating clinical assessment protocols into computational validation tasks focused on prediction consistency, memory retention, and adaptability under varying input perturbations.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate neuropsychological task protocols and performance validity tests relevant to cognitive resilience.\n2) Translate these into synthetic dataset challenges for LLM continual learning benchmarking.\n3) Implement baseline continual learning models (e.g., Elastic Weight Consolidation, replay-based) and test on the suite.\n4) Evaluate performance via metrics including consistency, adaptation speed, knowledge retention, and robustness to noise.\n5) Analyze correlation between neuropsychological-inspired scores and standard continual learning metrics.\n6) Refine benchmarks based on empirical results and clinical expert feedback.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A progression of context changes mirroring memory load and distraction conditions.\nOutput: The LLM updates its knowledge about related topics without catastrophic forgetting and displays consistent predictive fluency even under perturbation.\nExample: Input: \"Facts about historical events X and Y; now introduce contradictory new info on Y.\" Expected output: Updated knowledge on Y while retaining accurate info on X and demonstrating sustained reasoning coherence.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the neuropsychologically inspired benchmarks fail to discriminate model performance effectively, pivot to designing hybrid synthetic and empirical tasks integrating neurocognitive signal modeling (e.g., simulated EEG patterns) for richer evaluation. Alternatively, incorporate user feedback loops to iteratively refine benchmarks in an embodied interaction setting."

        "title": "Interactive Embodied Continual Learning with Real-Time User Feedback",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing continual learning architectures for LLMs inadequately integrate real-time interactive user feedback, leading to limited adaptability to user-specific knowledge dynamics.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the gap between theoretical predictive brain models and practical, user-centered adaptation by fusing embodied cognition frameworks with dynamic interaction mechanisms (from the 'personal comments' cluster), enabling LLMs to self-correct based on ongoing personalized feedback.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design an embodied continual learning architecture where LLMs engage in a continuous dialogue loop with users. User feedback acts as an embodied signal, modulating internal model updates through reinforcement mechanisms inspired by action and prediction cycles in cognitive science. This framework employs multi-modal feedback (text, gestures, sentiment) and adapts via meta-learning to personalize knowledge updating strategies.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop a prototype LLM interface capturing multi-modal user feedback.\n2) Implement continual learning with a feedback-driven self-correction module.\n3) Collect datasets of user interactions with explicit and implicit correction signals.\n4) Compare adaptive performance vs. baseline static continual learning methods.\n5) Evaluate user satisfaction, adaptation speed, and knowledge retention.\n6) Iterate to optimize reinforcement strategies and interaction fidelity.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User corrects LLM's outdated fact about a current event through a chat message and sentiment cues.\nOutput: LLM rapidly updates its internal knowledge of the event and demonstrates consistent accuracy in subsequent queries.\nExample: User states \"No, the event actually happened last week,\" followed by positive reinforcement; the LLM updates the timeline and refrains from repeating the error.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-modal feedback proves too noisy or sparse, fallback to solely textual explicit feedback with confidence-calibrated model updates. Alternatively, simulate synthetic user feedback based on known correction patterns for training before real deployment."

        "title": "Hybrid Cognitive-Computational Heuristics for Scalable World Knowledge Updating",
        "Problem_Statement": "Scalability of continual learning in LLMs remains challenged by computational costs and abstract theoretical models lacking operational heuristics for efficient real-time world knowledge updating.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the gap of absent computational frameworks by marrying cognitive science paradigms of prediction/action with new heuristic algorithms that smartly approximate knowledge updates, balancing theoretical abstraction with scalable application.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create a heuristic-driven continual learning framework inspired by predictive processing theories, implementing sparse update triggers based on surprise and prediction error signals. Integrate reinforcement schedules modeled after cognitive action selection to prioritize resource allocation, enabling large-scale, real-time knowledge updating with minimal computational overhead.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Design prediction-error-based heuristics to identify knowledge update necessity.\n2) Implement sparse update modules within existing LLM architectures.\n3) Train on streaming world knowledge datasets (e.g., news, scientific publications).\n4) Benchmark against standard continual learning baselines on update efficiency and accuracy.\n5) Perform ablation studies isolating heuristic components.\n6) Validate on real-time query tasks requiring updated knowledge.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Continuous feed of scientific facts with sudden breakthrough discovery.\nOutput: Model selectively updates knowledge relevant to the breakthrough without large-scale retraining, maintaining stable performance on unaffected topics.\nExample: Not updating unrelated domains despite high-volume incoming data, thus saving computation and enhancing efficiency.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If heuristic triggers miss critical updates, incorporate lightweight meta-learning to refine trigger thresholds dynamically. Alternatively, combine with small episodic memory buffers capturing key knowledge samples for fallback updates."
