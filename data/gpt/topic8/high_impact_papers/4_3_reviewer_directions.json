    "title": "Cognitive Anxiety-Reduction Inspired LLM Interpretability for Ethical Content Moderation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Users and moderators face anxiety when interacting with opaque LLM moderation outputs, impacting trust and ethical acceptance; current interpretability methods do not address psychological anxiety components during interaction.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external gap linking psychological anxiety reduction models from clinical communication to LLM interpretability frameworks, proposing innovative user-centered designs to soften mistrust and ethical concerns related to LLM moderation decisions.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop interpretability tools for LLM moderation based on psychological models of anxiety reduction, utilizing progressive disclosure, explanatory tone adjustment, and uncertainty quantification tailored to reduce cognitive load and stress. The framework adapts LLM output presentation dynamically based on inferred user anxiety metrics (via behavioral signals or feedback).",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Replicate psychological anxiety scales relevant to digital communication contexts.\n2. Design prototype LLM moderation interfaces implementing adaptive interpretability methods.\n3. Conduct user studies simulating social media moderation scenarios, measuring anxiety, trust, and comprehension metrics.\n4. Compare adaptive interpretability with standard explanation methods.\n5. Analyze correlations between interpretability features and ethical acceptance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM flags a post as borderline hate speech.\nExpected Output: Explanation interface gradually reveals reasoning with reassuring wording and uncertainty indicators, easing user anxiety about false positives.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive interface fails to reduce anxiety, fallback to static yet simplified explanation templates based on clinical communication best practices or integrate third-party psychological support chatbots to accompany moderation feedback."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a psychological anxiety reduction approach via adaptive LLM interpretability tools but lacks sufficient detail on how the system dynamically infers user anxiety from behavioral signals or direct feedback. Clarify the specific behavioral signals to be monitored, their measurement modalities, and the underlying models or algorithms for anxiety inference. Explain how these anxiety metrics concretely influence interpretability adjustments (e.g., progressive disclosure or tone changes) within the interface. Solidifying this causal mechanism is critical to establish methodological soundness and justify the expected user impact, ensuring the approach can be rigorously implemented and evaluated as claimed in the experiment plan. This will also aid reproducibility and technical validation of the approach's novelty and effectiveness in anxiety reduction during LLM moderation use cases from the user’s perspective. Consider integrating interdisciplinary insights from psychological signal processing and human-computer interaction literature to support the mechanism design and validation strategy explicitly in your method description and experiments planning stage, focusing on the interaction between anxiety inference and adaptive explanation presentation dynamics for ethical content moderation contexts.  \n\n"

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and the interdisciplinary nature of this idea, explicitly incorporate concepts from 'working alliance' and 'human-computer interaction' to strengthen the user-centered design and ethical acceptance framework. For example, leverage the 'working alliance' concept to design interpretability tools that not only reduce anxiety but actively foster a collaborative relationship or trust bond between users and the LLM moderation system. This could include modeling user trust development as a progressive interaction aligned with psychological frameworks in clinician-patient communication. Additionally, integrating user concerns and privacy considerations explicitly—perhaps by addressing transparency about uncertainty and data usage—can boost ethical acceptability and real-world impact. Extending the scope towards healthcare applications or broader user wellbeing contexts where anxiety and trust in AI are critical could broaden the idea’s impact and novelty, positioning it as a cornerstone for ethical NLP systems beyond content moderation. This integration will elevate the research’s theoretical grounding and practical significance while differentiating it within a competitive research space."
