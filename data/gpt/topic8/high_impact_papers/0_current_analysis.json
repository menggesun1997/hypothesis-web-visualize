The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Springer Handbook of Robotics', 'abstract': 'The second edition of this handbook provides a state-of-the-art cover view on the various aspects in the rapidly developing field of robotics. Reaching for the human frontier, robotics is vigorously engaged in the growing challenges of new emerging domains. Interacting, exploring, and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly touch people and their lives. The credible prospect of practical robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics as a modern scientific discipline. The ongoing vibrant expansion and strong growth of the field during the last decade has fueled this second edition of the Springer Handbook of Robotics. The first edition of the handbook soon became a landmark in robotics publishing and won the American Association of Publishers PROSE Award for Excellence in Physical Sciences & Mathematics as well as the organization’s Award for Engineering & Technology. The second edition of the handbook, edited by two internationally renowned scientists with the support of an outstanding team of seven part editors and more than 200 authors, continues to be an authoritative reference for robotics researchers, newcomers to the field, and scholars from related disciplines. The contents have been restructured to achieve four main objectives: the enlargement of foundational topics for robotics, the enlightenment of design of various types of robotic systems, the extension of the treatment on robots moving in the environment, and the enrichment of advanced robotics applications. Further to an extensive update, fifteen new chapters have been introduced on emerging topics, and a new generation of authors have joined the handbook’s team. A novel addition to the second edition is a comprehensive collection of multimedia references to more than 700 videos, which bring valuable insight into the contents.

Beyond folk psychology and its naïve theories of learning, psychological learning theories can be grouped into some basic categories, such as behaviorist learning theories, connectionist learning theories, cognitive learning theories, constructivist learning theories, and social learning theories. Learning theories are not limited to psychology and related fields of interest but rather we can find the topic of learning in various disciplines, such as philosophy and epistemology, education, information science, biology, and – as a result of the emergence of computer technologies – especially also in the field of computer sciences and artificial intelligence. As a consequence, machine learning struck a chord in the 1980s and became an important field of the learning sciences in general.

    "current_research_landscape": "The core focus of the research cluster lies in integrating state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies primarily from robotics, policy evaluation, sustainability science, and digital transformation of organizations. An underlying theme is optimizing advanced robotic applications and practical robots to enhance human-centric processes, supported by translational insights from policy frameworks and sustainable science and technology. The dominant methods reflect a multidisciplinary approach incorporating AI-driven advances (e.g., foundation models), digital transformation strategies, and policy evaluation techniques. The core paradigms revolve around leveraging large-scale, foundational AI models and socio-technical systems to foster innovation in practical robot deployment and organizational digital integration, along with informed policymaking to shape technology adoption and governance.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: The foundational papers acknowledge critical unknowns in how large foundation models operate, their failure modes, and their emergent capabilities, highlighting the need for deeper interdisciplinary research. The local network’s bridge nodes 'policy evaluation' and 'policy makers' connect thematic islands yet show underexplored interactions between technological innovation (robotics, digital transformations) and governance frameworks. There is a gap in understanding the tightly coupled interactions between organizational transformation, policy making, and the deployment of advanced AI-driven systems, such as large language models (LLMs) encoding encyclopedic knowledge for open-domain QA.\n\nExternal/Novel Gaps: The global context analysis ('Hidden Bridges') reveals underexploited interdisciplinary intersections. First, connecting 'practical robots' with 'policy' through reinforcement learning and dynamic environment adaptation offers a potential to enhance robot autonomy while aligning with regulatory standards. Second, linking 'practical robots' and 'digital transformation of organizations' via human-robot collaboration, robotic process automation, and socio-technical systems suggests biological and organizational adoption challenges remain unaddressed. Third, coupling 'policy' with 'digital transformation' in contexts like health and service management highlights the overlooked criticality of policy frameworks in enabling safe, equitable AI integration. These cross-disciplinary bridges could uniquely address the gap in understanding and operationalizing semantic encoding in LLMs contextualized within organizational and policy ecosystems for open-domain question answering.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate reinforcement learning and imitation learning techniques (from the 'practical robots'–'policy' hidden bridge) with the organizational digital transformation paradigm to develop adaptive, policy-aware AI systems. These systems could dynamically encode and update encyclopedic world knowledge, ensuring open-domain QA tools adhere to evolving ethical and legal standards.\n\nOpportunity 2: Employ human-robot collaboration and socio-technical systems frameworks (highlighted in the 'practical robots'–'digital transformation of organisations' hidden bridge) combined with advanced foundation model interpretability research to enhance semantic encoding transparency in LLMs. This approach would facilitate more trustworthy open-domain question answering in complex, real-world scenarios requiring human-AI synergy.\n\nOpportunity 3: Leverage policy evaluation methods and digital transformation strategies from health and service management domains (from the 'policy'–'digital transformation of organisations' hidden bridge) to create governance models that guide the deployment of LLM-powered encyclopedic QA systems. This would directly address internal limitations around ethical, legal, and bias concerns highlighted in foundational literature, ensuring technology benefits society and minimizes risk."
