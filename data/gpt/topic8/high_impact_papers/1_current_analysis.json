With the technological development of deep learning-based high-precision recognition models and natural generation models, Metaverse is being strengthened with various factors, from mobile-based always-on access to connectivity with reality using virtual currency. The integration of enhanced social activities and neural-net methods requires a new definition of Metaverse suitable for the present, different from the previous Metaverse. This paper divides the concepts and essential techniques necessary for realizing the Metaverse into three components (i.e., hardware, software, and contents) and three approaches (i.e., user interaction, implementation, and application) rather than marketing or hardware approach to conduct a comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, we describe essential methods based on three components and techniques to Metaverse’s representative Ready Player One, Roblox, and Facebook research in the domain of films, games, and studies. Finally, we summarize the limitations and directions for implementing the immersive Metaverse as social influences, constraints, and open challenges.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'The SAGE Encyclopedia of Communication Research Methods', 'abstract': 'Communication research is evolving and changing in a world of online journals, open-access, and new ways of obtaining data and conducting experiments via the Internet. Although there are generic encyclopedias describing basic social science research methodologies in general, until now there has been no comprehensive A-to-Z reference work exploring methods specific to communication and media studies. Our entries, authored by key figures in the field, focus on special considerations when applied specifically to communication research, accompanied by engaging examples from the literature of communication, journalism, and media studies. Entries cover every step of the research process, from the creative development of research topics and questions to literature reviews, selection of best methods (whether quantitative, qualitative, or mixed) for analyzing research results and publishing research findings, whether in traditional media or via new media outlets. In addition to expected entries covering the basics of theories and methods traditionally used in communication research, other entries discuss important trends influencing the future of that research, including contemporary practical issues students will face in communication professions, the influences of globalization on research, use of new recording technologies in fieldwork, and the challenges and opportunities related to studying online multi-media environments. Email, texting, cellphone video, and blogging are shown not only as topics of research but also as means of collecting and analyzing data. Still other entries delve into considerations of accountability, copyright, confidentiality, data ownership and security, privacy, and other aspects of conducting an ethical research program. Features: • 652 signed entries are contained in an authoritative work spanning four volumes available in choice of electronic or print formats. • Although organized A-to-Z, front matter includes a Reader’s Guide grouping entries thematically to help students interested in a specific aspect of communication research to more easily locate directly related entries. • Back matter includes a Chronology of the development of the field of communication research; a Resource Guide to classic books, journals, and associations; a Glossary introducing the terminology of the field; and a detailed Index. • Entries conclude with References/Further Readings and Cross-References to related entries to guide students further in their research journeys. • The Index, Reader’s Guide themes, and Cross-References combine to provide robust search-and-browse in the e-version.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Handbook of Research Methods in Health Social Sciences', 'abstract': 'Research is defined by the Australian Research Council as “the creation of new knowledge and/or the use of existing knowledge in a new and creative way so as to generate new concepts, methodologies, inventions and understandings”. Research is thus the foundation for knowledge. It produces evidence and informs actions that can provide wider benefit to a society. The knowledge that researchers cultivate from a piece of research can be adopted for social and health programs that can improve the health and well-being of the individuals, their communities and the societies in which they live. As we have witnessed in all corners of the globe, research has become an endeavor that most of us in the health and social sciences cannot avoid. This Handbook is conceived to provide the foundation to readers who wish to embark on a research project in order to form knowledge that they need. The Handbook comprises four main sections: Traditional research methods sciences; Innovative research methods; Doing cross-cultural research; and Sensitive research methodology and approach. This Handbook attests to the diversity and richness of research methods in the health and social sciences. It will benefit many readers, particularly students and researchers who undertake research in health and social science areas. It is also valuable for the training needs of postgraduate students who wish to undertake research in cross-cultural settings, with special groups of people, as it provides essential knowledge not only on the methods of data collection but also salient issues that they need to know if they wish to succeed in their research endeavors.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'The Philosophy of Information', 'abstract': 'This book brings together the outcome of ten years of research. It is based on a simple project, which was begun towards the end of the 1990s: information is a crucial concept, which deserves a thorough philosophical investigation. So the book lays down the conceptual foundations of a new area of research: the philosophy of information. It does so systematically, by pursuing three goals. The first is metatheoretical. The book describes what the philosophy of information is, its problems, and its method of levels of abstraction. These are the topics of the first part, which comprises chapters one, two and three. The second goal is introductory. In chapters four and five, the book explores the complex and diverse nature of several informational concepts and phenomena. The third goal is constructive. In the remaining ten chapters, the book answers some classic philosophical questions in information-theoretical terms. As a result, the book provides the first, unified and coherent research programme for the philosophy of information, understood as a new, independent area of research, concerned with (1) the critical investigation of the conceptual nature and basic principles of information, including its dynamics, utilization, and sciences; and (2) the elaboration and application of information-theoretic and computational methodologies to philosophical problems.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Summary of ChatGPT-Related research and perspective towards the future of large language models', 'abstract': \"This paper presents a comprehensive survey of ChatGPT-related (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) research, state-of-the-art large language models (LLM) from the GPT series, and their prospective applications across diverse domains. Indeed, key innovations such as large-scale pre-training that captures knowledge across the entire world wide web, instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have played significant roles in enhancing LLMs' adaptability and performance. We performed an in-depth analysis of 194 relevant papers on arXiv, encompassing trend analysis, word cloud representation, and distribution analysis across various application domains. The findings reveal a significant and increasing interest in ChatGPT-related research, predominantly centered on direct natural language processing applications, while also demonstrating considerable potential in areas ranging from education and history to mathematics, medicine, and physics.

Reaching for the human frontier, robotics is vigorously engaged in the growing challenges of new emerging domains. Interacting, exploring, and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly touch people and their lives. The credible prospect of practical robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics as a modern scientific discipline. The ongoing vibrant expansion and strong growth of the field during the last decade has fueled this second edition of the Springer Handbook of Robotics. The first edition of the handbook soon became a landmark in robotics publishing and won the American Association of Publishers PROSE Award for Excellence in Physical Sciences & Mathematics as well as the organization’s Award for Engineering & Technology. The second edition of the handbook, edited by two internationally renowned scientists with the support of an outstanding team of seven part editors and more than 200 authors, continues to be an authoritative reference for robotics researchers, newcomers to the field, and scholars from related disciplines. The contents have been restructured to achieve four main objectives: the enlargement of foundational topics for robotics, the enlightenment of design of various types of robotic systems, the extension of the treatment on robots moving in the environment, and the enrichment of advanced robotics applications. Further to an extensive update, fifteen new chapters have been introduced on emerging topics, and a new generation of authors have joined the handbook’s team. A novel addition to the second edition is a comprehensive collection of multimedia references to more than 700 videos, which bring valuable insight into the contents. The videos can be viewed directly augmented into the text with a smartphone or tablet using a unique and specially designed app.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Tall Tales about the Mind and Brain', 'abstract': \"Does listening to Mozart make us more intelligent? Is there such a thing as a gay gene? Does the size of the brain matter? Does the moon influence our behaviour? Can we communicate with the dead? Can graphology tell us anything about a person's character? Is the human brain clonable? Can mind conquer matter and diseases? Are out-of-body experiences possible? To some people, the answer to all these questions is a resounding ‘no’, but to many people these questions represent serious beliefs about the mind and brain — beliefs that drive their everyday behaviour. Whole industries have developed founded on these dubious claims about the mind and brain. Even major corporations have dabbled with assessment methods such as those advocated by graphology, accepting and rejecting candidates on the basic of their handwriting. Expectant parents buy books and tapes by the dozen showing them how to improve the intelligence of their child by playing them classical music. People subscribe to expensive therapies founded on beliefs rather than science, or risk their health buying books that tell them how they can conquer illness through positive thinking, perhaps at the expense of more scientifically proven treatments. This book presents a survey of common myths about the mind and brain. In a lighthearted and accessible style, it exposes the truth behind these beliefs, how they are perpetuated, why people believe them, and why they might even exist in the first place.\"}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Simians, Cyborgs, and Women', 'abstract': 'Simians, Cyborgs and Women is a powerful collection of ten essays written between 1978 and 1989. Although on the surface, simians, cyborgs and women may seem an odd threesome, Haraway describes their profound link as \"creatures\" which have had a great destabilizing place in Western evolutionary technology and biology. Throughout this book, Haraway analyzes accounts, narratives, and stories of the creation of nature, living organisms, and cyborgs. At once a social reality and a science fiction, the cyborg--a hybrid of organism and machine--represents transgressed boundaries and intense fusions of the nature/culture split. By providing an escape from rigid dualisms, the cyborg exists in a post-gender world, and as such holds immense possibilities for modern feminists. Haraway\\'s recent book, Primate Visions, has been called \"outstanding,\" \"original,\" and \"brilliant,\" by leading scholars in the field.

    "current_research_landscape": "The core research cluster centers around advancing communication methods and media studies through neural network-based recognition and generative models within hardware-constrained environments, exemplified by platforms like Facebook and related social media research. The Central Nodes highlight 'communication research', 'media studies', and 'neural net method' as core focal points, reinforcing that the main problem addressed is enhancing human-computer/human-robot communication by leveraging sophisticated AI models. The two Thematic Islands reflect: (1) methodological and conceptual frameworks of communication research in multimedia environments, and (2) technical implementations of neural net and generative models in hardware approaches, suggesting a dual emphasis on theory-driven studies and empirical model development. Dominant methods include deep learning architectures, natural language processing (NLP) via large language models, and multimodal recognition models, which are used to simulate and improve naturalistic communication and interaction scenarios. The cluster highlights the significance of integrating multi-media environment data and drawing connections through cross-references and reader's guide themes to systematically augment research rigor and scope.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite significant advances, the current literature exhibits limitations in fully bridging theoretical communication research with applied neural net methods, as evidenced by Bridge Nodes linking 'communication research' and 'media studies' but a less explicit translation into integrated commonsense reasoning within LLMs supporting nuanced human-robot interactions. There is also a lack of detailed treatment on how hardware constraints affect model deployment in dynamic interactive settings, and insufficient exploration of multimodal interaction beyond text and static recognition models. External/Novel Gaps: The Global Context & Hidden Bridges analysis reveals a promising but under-explored nexus between communication research and neural net methodologies found in areas like convolutional neural networks, multimodal interaction, and neural machine translation. Concepts such as U-Net architectures and channel estimation algorithms—commonly used in image segmentation and communication systems—have not been fully leveraged to enhance the grounding of commonsense knowledge in LLMs for embodied agents. Utilizing these hidden bridge concepts from information and computing sciences could address contextual grounding and improve LLM-driven communication robustness in real-time, multimodal human-robot interaction scenarios.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Leverage advanced convolutional neural network techniques, such as U-Net architectures, combined with LLM generative models to improve multimodal context awareness in human-robot interaction, addressing the internal gap related to insufficient multimodal grounding, as highlighted in the second thematic island and local hardware constraints.\n\nOpportunity 2: Integrate channel estimation and equalization algorithms from communication theory into the processing pipeline of LLM-based interaction systems to enhance real-time adaptability and reduce computational complexity while maintaining rich commonsense reasoning capabilities, thus bridging gaps between 'communication research' and 'neural net methods'.\n\nOpportunity 3: Develop interdisciplinary frameworks that combine media studies' insights on communication dynamics with neural machine translation and multimodal speech recognition systems to create enriched, culturally-aware commonsense knowledge bases supporting more naturalistic and personalized human-robot interactions, addressing limitations in current media studies integration detailed in the literature and using the hidden bridge insights from information and computing sciences identified in the GPS analysis."
