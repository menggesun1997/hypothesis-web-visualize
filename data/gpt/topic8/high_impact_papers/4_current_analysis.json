BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'The SAGE Encyclopedia of Communication Research Methods', 'abstract': 'Communication research is evolving and changing in a world of online journals, open-access, and new ways of obtaining data and conducting experiments via the Internet. Although there are generic encyclopedias describing basic social science research methodologies in general, until now there has been no comprehensive A-to-Z reference work exploring methods specific to communication and media studies. Our entries, authored by key figures in the field, focus on special considerations when applied specifically to communication research, accompanied by engaging examples from the literature of communication, journalism, and media studies. Entries cover every step of the research process, from the creative development of research topics and questions to literature reviews, selection of best methods (whether quantitative, qualitative, or mixed) for analyzing research results and publishing research findings, whether in traditional media or via new media outlets. In addition to expected entries covering the basics of theories and methods traditionally used in communication research, other entries discuss important trends influencing the future of that research, including contemporary practical issues students will face in communication professions, the influences of globalization on research, use of new recording technologies in fieldwork, and the challenges and opportunities related to studying online multi-media environments. Email, texting, cellphone video, and blogging are shown not only as topics of research but also as means of collecting and analyzing data. Still other entries delve into considerations of accountability, copyright, confidentiality, data ownership and security, privacy, and other aspects of conducting an ethical research program. Features: • 652 signed entries are contained in an authoritative work spanning four volumes available in choice of electronic or print formats. • Although organized A-to-Z, front matter includes a Reader’s Guide grouping entries thematically to help students interested in a specific aspect of communication research to more easily locate directly related entries. • Back matter includes a Chronology of the development of the field of communication research; a Resource Guide to classic books, journals, and associations; a Glossary introducing the terminology of the field; and a detailed Index. • Entries conclude with References/Further Readings and Cross-References to related entries to guide students further in their research journeys. • The Index, Reader’s Guide themes, and Cross-References combine to provide robust search-and-browse in the e-version.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Handbook of Research Methods in Health Social Sciences', 'abstract': 'Research is defined by the Australian Research Council as “the creation of new knowledge and/or the use of existing knowledge in a new and creative way so as to generate new concepts, methodologies, inventions and understandings”. Research is thus the foundation for knowledge. It produces evidence and informs actions that can provide wider benefit to a society. The knowledge that researchers cultivate from a piece of research can be adopted for social and health programs that can improve the health and well-being of the individuals, their communities and the societies in which they live. As we have witnessed in all corners of the globe, research has become an endeavor that most of us in the health and social sciences cannot avoid. This Handbook is conceived to provide the foundation to readers who wish to embark on a research project in order to form knowledge that they need. The Handbook comprises four main sections: Traditional research methods sciences; Innovative research methods; Doing cross-cultural research; and Sensitive research methodology and approach. This Handbook attests to the diversity and richness of research methods in the health and social sciences. It will benefit many readers, particularly students and researchers who undertake research in health and social science areas. It is also valuable for the training needs of postgraduate students who wish to undertake research in cross-cultural settings, with special groups of people, as it provides essential knowledge not only on the methods of data collection but also salient issues that they need to know if they wish to succeed in their research endeavors.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'The SAGE Encyclopedia of Educational Research, Measurement, and Evaluation', 'abstract': 'In an era of curricular changes and experiments and high-stakes testing, educational measurement and evaluation is more important than ever. In addition to expected entries covering the basics of traditional theories and methods, other entries discuss important sociopolitical issues and trends influencing the future of that research and practice. Textbooks, handbooks, monographs and other publications focus on various aspects of educational research, measurement and evaluation, but to date, there exists no major reference guide for students new to the field. This comprehensive work fills that gap, covering traditional areas while pointing the way to future developments.

These three models reflect different theories about the relationship between markets, the state, and individual and collective rights. They also frequently collide in an international domain, leading to a contested battle over the present and future ethos of the digital economy. The book discusses how governments and tech companies navigate these inevitable conflicts that arise when these contrasting regulatory approaches collide in the international domain, ultimately asking which digital empire will prevail in their mutual contest for global influence. These regulatory conflicts take place at the moment of time when digital societies are at an inflection point. The cascade of digital regulation that is now being drafted around the world will be crucial in shaping the digital economy and digital society for years and decades to come. Governments, technology companies, and digital citizens are making important choices that will shape the future ethos of the digital society and define the soul of the digital economy. This book lays bare the choices we face as societies and individuals, explain the forces that shape those choices, and spell out the stakes involved in making those choices.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'SFPE Handbook of Fire Protection Engineering', 'abstract': 'The definitive reference on fire protection engineering, now expanded to three volumes Available in electronic format for the first time An indispensible source for reliable coverage of fundamentals, fire dynamics, hazard calculations, fire risk analysis, modeling and more SFPE members, please contact SFPE for special discount price'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'The Future of the Professions, How Technology Will Transform the Work of Human Experts', 'abstract': \"<p>This book predicts the decline of today's professions and describes the people and systems that will replace them. In an Internet society, according to Richard Susskind and Daniel Susskind, we will neither need nor want doctors, teachers, accountants, architects, the clergy, consultants, lawyers, and many others, to work as they did in the 20th century. The Future of the Professions explains how 'increasingly capable systems' -- from telepresence to artificial intelligence -- will bring fundamental change in the way that the 'practical expertise' of specialists is made available in society.  The authors challenge the 'grand bargain' -- the arrangement that grants various monopolies to today's professionals. They argue that our current professions are antiquated, opaque and no longer affordable, and that the expertise of their best is enjoyed only by a few. In their place, they propose six new models for producing and distributing expertise in society.  The book raises important practical and moral questions. In an era when machines can out-perform human beings at most tasks, what are the prospects for employment, who should own and control online expertise, and what tasks should be reserved exclusively for people? Based on the authors' in-depth research of more than ten professions, and illustrated by numerous examples from each, this is the first book to assess and question the relevance of the professions in the 21st century.</p>\"}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Encyclopedia of Quality of Life and Well-Being Research', 'abstract': 'This 2nd edition is a definitive resource on issues pertaining to the full range of topics in scientific and other scholarly research on the quality of life, including health-related quality of life research or also called patient-reported outcomes research.

Fifteen years ago, the journal Food Quality and Preference was fairly new. Now it holds an eminent position as a venue for research on sensory test methods (among many other topics).\\xa0 Knowledge of the intricate cellular processes in chemoreception, as well as their genetic basis has undergone nothing less than a revolution, culminating in the award of the Nobel Prize to Buck and Axel in 2004 for their discovery of the olfactory receptor gene super family. Advances in statistical methodology have accelerated as well. Sensometrics meetings are now vigorous and well-attended annual events. And yet, some things stay the same. Sensory testing will always involve human participants. But humans are tough measuring instruments to work with. They come with varying degrees of acumen, training, experiences, differing genetic equipment, sensory capabilities, and of course, different preferences. Human foibles and their associated error variance will continue to place a limitation on sensory tests and actionable results. Although methods continue to evolve, appreciation of the core principles of the field is the key to effective application of sensory test methods. This book has been expanded to reflect the advances in methodologies, theory, and analysis that have transpired in the last 15 years. The chapters are now divided into numbered subsections. This may be of assistance to educators who may wish to assign only certain critical sections to beginning students. In some of the opening sections instructors will find suggestions about which sections are key for fundamental understanding of that topic or method. In many chapters we have gone out on a limb and specified a “recommended procedure.” In cases where there are multiple options for procedure or analysis, we usually chose a simple solution over one that is more complex. This text attempts to be comprehensive, yet understandable to all students at the university level. All the major sensory test methods are illustrated and discussed, including discrimination, descriptive, and affective tests. Some chapters are devoted to special topics, such as thresholds, time-intensity methods, similarity testing, color, texture, sensory quality control, qualitative research methods, consumer test methods and questionnaires, shelf life testing, an introduction to multivariate statistical techniques, and strategic sensory research. The statistical appendix provides basic instruction in the common statistical analyses for sensory evaluation with worked examples. Harry T. Lawless is Professor of Food Science at Cornell University where he teaches sensory evaluation. He has 35 years of experience in chemosensory research and psychophysics. He spent five years in consumer testing in industry, and serves as a consultant to various food and consumer products companies on sensory test methods. Hildegarde Heymann is Professor of Viticulture and Enology at the University of California at Davis where she teaches sensory evaluation of wine and sensometrics. She spent nearly 17 years at the University of Missouri as a professor of sensory science.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "title": "Research Landscape on Ethical and Bias Implications of World Knowledge Encoding in LLMs for Social Media Moderation",
    "current_research_landscape": "The central focus of this research cluster revolves around communication research and media studies, specifically analyzing language models (LMs) and pretrained NLP systems primarily in English, as core tools for interpreting and moderating social media content. Foundational works emphasize the development and evaluation of large language models, the risks inherent in their training datasets and architectures ('On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots'), and the methodological rigor required for researching communication and media phenomena. The research landscape is multidisciplinary, combining computational linguistic techniques (e.g., pretrained models, NLP benchmarks) with social science paradigms related to media studies, communication methods, and sociopolitical considerations. Dominant methods include using large-scale pretrained language models fine-tuned for specific tasks, qualitative and quantitative communication research strategies, and ethical assessment frameworks for technology deployment within societal contexts. The thematic islands indicate a bifurcation between core language technology development and its application within communication/media studies, bridged by research into communication methods that help contextualize and interpret LLM output and influence.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps include a lack of comprehensive integration between communication research epistemologies and the technical design of LLMs, as suggested by the bridging nodes connecting communication research and media studies but absent deep methodological fusion with NLP model development. Foundational papers acknowledge risks due to dataset curation, environmental cost, and ethical trade-offs but offer limited frameworks for systematically addressing biases encoding world knowledge within LLMs specifically in social media content moderation contexts.  \n\nExternally, the global analysis reveals an overlooked opportunity in linking 'Reader’s Guide themes' from communication research with 'language model' technologies informed by biomedical and clinical sciences, psychology, and implementation science concepts. For example, psychological models of cognitive control, anxiety reduction, and interpretation processes (such as automated content analysis inspired by clinical communication models) have not been explicitly leveraged to enhance ethical evaluation, bias detection, or interpretability in LLMs for social media. This hidden bridge offers a cross-disciplinary pathway to embed clinical and psychological insights into understanding how LLMs encode and propagate world knowledge and biases impacting user interactions.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate clinical communication models and psychological constructs (e.g., cognitive control and interpretation frameworks from biomedical sciences) with NLP pretrained models to develop more nuanced ethical evaluation metrics and bias assessment tools that reflect human interpretative processes in social media moderation.\n\nOpportunity 2: Leverage implementation science methodologies and consolidated criteria for qualitative research from health communication to design ethically-grounded, participatory frameworks for dataset curation and fine-tuning of LLMs, addressing the internal gaps of ethical oversight and stakeholder value alignment highlighted in foundational work.\n\nOpportunity 3: Develop hybrid multimodal communication research paradigms combining language modeling with media studies’ insights on multi-media environments and cross-references to related entries to create transparent, explainable LLM-based moderation systems that consider sociopolitical dimensions of digital content regulation, inspired by regulatory model contrasts seen in digital empires research."
