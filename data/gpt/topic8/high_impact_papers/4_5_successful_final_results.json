    "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Reader's Guide Embedding for Psychological Context in LLM Moderation",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM moderation lacks incorporation of fine-grained psychological and clinical interpretation guides derived from communication research, limiting nuanced bias detection and world knowledge encoding comprehension.",
    "Motivation": "Fulfills the external critical gap by embedding 'Reader’s Guide' themes from communication research, enriched with biomedical and psychological interpretation schemas, into LLM architectures to enhance moderation interpretability and ethical bias assessment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct embedding modules capturing psychological constructs (e.g., cognitive load, interpretive frames) and Reader’s Guide thematic annotations, integrating these embeddings into LLM input representations via adapter layers. The model jointly optimizes to leverage these psychological contexts for improved ethical moderation and bias sensitivity.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Digitize and structure Reader’s Guide themes with psychological annotations.\n2. Develop embedding adapters and integrate into pretrained LLMs.\n3. Fine-tune on social media moderation datasets with psychological interpretative labels.\n4. Evaluate improvement in bias detection metrics and interpretability.\n5. Conduct user studies to validate human-alignment of moderation rationales.",

        "title": "Integrative Psychological and Organizational Commonsense Embeddings for Enhanced LLM Moderation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM moderation systems inadequately incorporate fine-grained psychological interpretations and lack integration of commonsense knowledge about organizational behavior and social structures, limiting nuanced bias detection and contextual understanding of communication in diverse social media scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "To address the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty challenge, this proposal innovatively fuses psychological Reader's Guide embeddings with commonsense reasoning about organizational dynamics, creating a multi-layered interpretative schema. This cross-disciplinary approach surpasses existing methods by embedding rich psychological constructs alongside contextual organizational knowledge, thereby enhancing LLM interpretability, bias sensitivity, and ethical moderation in complex social communication settings.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular embedding architecture integrated via specialized adapter layers within pretrained LLMs. This architecture consists of two complementary modules: (1) Psychological Reader's Guide Embeddings capturing cognitive and interpretive frames (e.g., cognitive load, inferential schemas), and (2) Organizational Commonsense Reasoning Embeddings encapsulating structured knowledge about organizational behavior, communication hierarchies, and social group dynamics. \n\nMechanistically, the psychological and organizational embeddings are processed in parallel with token embeddings and fused through cross-attention adapter layers that recalibrate the attention weights based on these interpretive contexts. Concretely, adapter fusion operates as follows: given input token representations H, psychological embeddings P, and organizational embeddings O, the fused representation H' is computed by gated cross-attention modules where P and O dynamically modulate the token-level attention maps. This modulation guides the model's focus on semantically and contextually relevant cues crucial for nuanced bias detection. Output logits are further calibrated through a context-aware output refinement layer that integrates these embeddings to produce moderation decisions with explicit interpretability signals. \n\nPseudocode excerpt:\n\n```\nfor each layer in LLM:\n    H = LLM_layer(H_previous)\n    P_context = AdapterPsych(H, P)\n    O_context = AdapterOrg(H, O)\n    H = CrossAttentionFuse(H, P_context, O_context)\n\nlogits = OutputCalibrationLayer(H, P, O)\n```\n\nThis design is inspired and justified by prior work on adapter fusion and knowledge integration in LLMs, grounding psychological constructs and commonsense organizational knowledge as operationalized input priming rather than conceptual add-ons, ensuring interpretability and model explainability in ethical moderation tasks.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Digitize and structurally annotate Reader's Guide psychological themes with standardized biomedical and cognitive schemas.\n2. Curate and formalize an organizational commonsense knowledge base focused on communication hierarchies, behavioral norms, and group dynamics relevant to social media discourse.\n3. Develop and pretrain dual embedding adapters (psychological and organizational) leveraging transformer-based cross-attention mechanisms.\n4. Integrate adapters into pretrained LLMs, implementing the cross-attention fusion architecture.\n5. Fine-tune the integrated model on enriched social media moderation datasets annotated with psychological and organizational interpretation labels.\n6. Evaluate bias detection improvements using metrics sensitive to subtle semantic and social bias manifestations.\n7. Conduct qualitative user studies to assess moderation rationale interpretability, focusing on transparency of psychological and organizational reasoning.\n8. Perform ablation studies to quantify individual and joint contributions of psychological and organizational embeddings.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A social media post narrating a controversial workplace incident with ambiguous power dynamics and implicit organizational hierarchy references.\nExpected Output: A moderation decision reflecting sensitivity to subtle biases informed both by psychological interpretation of narrative framing and commonsense knowledge of organizational roles and behaviors, accompanied by explainable rationales highlighting these interpretive cues.\n\nAnother Input: Ambiguous social media commentary embedding group communication norms with potential microaggressions.\nExpected Output: Nuanced bias detection that integrates psychological load considerations and organizational communication schema to flag content appropriately, demonstrating layered interpretative schema application.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should adapter fusion complexity hinder training convergence or marginally improve bias detection, fallback involves (1) deploying psychological and organizational embeddings as separate multitask learning objectives guiding auxiliary classification heads, allowing progressive decoupled refinement, or (2) employing external interpretable modules outside the LLM pipeline that post-process model outputs with psychological and organizational reasoning heuristics to augment moderation decisions."

          "feedback_content": "While the Proposed_Method outlines embedding psychological constructs through adapter layers in LLMs, the explanation lacks clarity on how these embeddings concretely influence the moderation decision process. The narrative would benefit from a more detailed mechanistic description of how the psychological Reader's Guide themes interplay with LLM internal representations to improve bias detection and interpretability. Specifically, clarifying whether these embeddings alter attention mechanisms, augment token representations, or guide output calibration would strengthen the soundness of the approach. Incorporate pseudocode or diagrams in future drafts to concretely illustrate this mechanism and justify its validity based on prior work in adapter fusion or psychological embedding integration techniques. This would help reviewers understand how the psychological context is operationalized rather than conceptually assumed, thus improving the internal reasoning soundness of the method section."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and the globally linked concepts of 'commonsense reasoning', 'organizational behavior', and 'organizational structure', an impactful enhancement would be to extend the embedding architecture to incorporate commonsense reasoning modules. These modules could provide the LLM with a richer context for human communication nuances, anchoring psychological frames in broader social and organizational contexts. For instance, integrating commonsense knowledge about organizational behavior and communication hierarchies could enhance bias detection subtlety, especially in social media moderation scenarios involving group dynamics or structural biases. This cross-disciplinary fusion would distinguishedly position your work by adding a layered interpretative schema that goes beyond psychological annotations alone. Explicitly propose such integration either as an extension of adapter layers or as additional multi-task learning signals to increase novelty and broaden impact."
