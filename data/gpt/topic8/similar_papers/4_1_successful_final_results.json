    "title": "Federated Multi-party Privacy-enhancing Bias Mitigation for LLMs in Social Media",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM-based social media moderation systems lack integrated privacy-preserving mechanisms combined with bias mitigation that protect user data while ensuring equitable moderation across demographics.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the external gap around underexplored intersections between social data and privacy protection mechanisms by proposing a federated learning system incorporating advanced privacy-enhancing technologies and bias mitigation strategies.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a federated learning architecture where user data never leaves devices; local models learn personalized bias correction factors based on differential privacy guarantees. Aggregation servers combine locally learned bias mitigation insights without exposing raw data. The system includes adaptive privacy budget allocation sensitive to user trust levels and content sensitivity to balance privacy and utility aggressively.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble a dataset of multilingual social media posts labeled for harmful biases and ethical violations. 2. Implement baseline centralized bias mitigation models and federated counterparts with differential privacy. 3. Measure bias reduction, model accuracy, privacy leakage, and user trust in simulations. 4. Test scalability and robustness on synthetic federated data distributions reflecting real social media user diversity.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A batch of posts with demographic bias issues (e.g., against a minority group) processed locally on user devices. Expected Output: The federated model effectively reduces biased moderation decisions compared to centralized baselines, with quantifiable privacy guarantees and no raw data exposure.",

        "title": "Federated Multi-party Privacy-Enhancing Bias Mitigation for LLMs in Multilingual Social Media with Regulatory Compliance and User-Centric Trust Modeling",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing large language model (LLM)-based social media moderation systems face significant challenges integrating robust privacy-preserving mechanisms with effective bias mitigation across diverse demographics and languages while complying with regulations like GDPR and CCPA. Moreover, existing federated approaches lack formalized personalization and privacy budget adaptation techniques that maintain fairness and convergence without sacrificing utility or user trust.",
        "Motivation": "This work addresses an underexplored intersection of federated learning, bias mitigation, and privacy protection tailored for multilingual social media content moderation. Our approach advances current methods by integrating adaptive privacy budgeting grounded in regulatory frameworks (GDPR, CCPA), incorporating state-of-the-art NLP techniques such as offensive language detection and language identification to enhance granularity, and employing cognitive load theory-inspired user trust modeling to personalize privacy-utility trade-offs. By rigorously formalizing mechanisms to maintain fairness consistency across clients, and grounding experiments in both synthetic and real federated environments, we push the frontier for equitable, privacy-compliant, and user-trusted social media moderation at scale.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a federated learning architecture with detailed, mathematically grounded mechanisms for local bias mitigation personalization and adaptive privacy budgeting, fully compliant with GDPR and CCPA requirements. Key components include:\n\n1. **Personalized Local Bias Correction:** Each client device runs a local bias mitigation model that adjusts corrections based on user- and community-level feedback, using a constrained optimization formulation to ensure consistency and fairness across heterogeneous data distributions. Formally, bias correction parameters \\(\\theta_i\\) at client \\(i\\) are optimized to minimize local bias metrics subject to fairness constraints shared as meta-parameters in aggregation.\n\n2. **Privacy-Preserving Aggregation:** Instead of naive averaging, we design a secure aggregation protocol that anonymizes locally learned bias adjustment parameters, employing differential privacy noise calibrated by per-client sensitivity and content sensitivity scores derived from an NLP pipeline (including offensive language and language detection). This ensures no raw data or sensitive model information is exposed, balancing privacy and utility rigorously.\n\n3. **Adaptive Privacy Budgeting Framework:** We formalize an adaptive budgeting algorithm that adjusts the per-round privacy budget \\(\\epsilon_i^{(t)}\\) based on a composite trust score derived by integrating: \n   - Platform trust indicators (e.g., device trustworthiness, past privacy behaviors),\n   - Content sensitivity classification from NLP models,\n   - User cognitive load measures inspired by adaptive learning system theory to prevent undue privacy burdens.\n\nTrust quantification uses a hybrid scoring model combining quantitative metadata and qualitative user feedback, ensuring a transparent and justifiable privacy-utility trade-off.\n\n4. **Compliance Integration:** The system logs all data handling per GDPR/CCPA audit requirements and includes mechanisms for user consent and data subject rights enforcement.\n\nWe provide pseudocode for bias correction optimization and privacy budget adaptation in the supplementary materials, enabling reproducibility and rigorous peer evaluation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. **Dataset Collection & Annotation:** Collaborate with social media platforms and privacy experts to compile a multilingual dataset of posts labeled for harmful biases, offensive content, and ethical violations. Data collection obeys GDPR and CCPA via federated, on-device labeling tools with differential privacy guarantees, supplemented by small-scale crowdsourced annotation overseen by ethical boards.\n\n2. **Baseline Implementation:** Implement state-of-the-art centralized bias mitigation models including adversarial de-biasing and differential privacy-enhanced training, as well as recent federated bias mitigation frameworks.\n\n3. **Federated Training & Evaluation:** Deploy the proposed federated local bias correction with adaptive privacy budgeting over simulated realistic federated distributions that reflect imbalanced demographic and linguistic groups. Incorporate NLP pipelines for language detection and offensive language classification to stratify analysis.\n\n4. **User Trust Quantification:** Develop a simulation environment with synthetic users modeling varying trust levels using cognitive load theory-inspired metrics. Validate the adaptive privacy budget's efficacy in balancing privacy and utility.\n\n5. **Real-World Pilot:** Collaborate for a limited federated deployment on consenting user devices in a controlled environment to evaluate practical convergence, bias reduction, privacy leakage, and user trust via surveys and telemetry.\n\n6. **Robustness & Scalability Testing:** Stress test the system on synthetic heterogeneous data including highly skewed and adversarial distributions.\n\n7. **Fallback Strategy Integration:** Systematically incorporate fallback mechanisms (hybrid decentralized learning, use of trusted execution environments) with contingency triggers and evaluate their impact compared to baseline and primary method.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A batch of multilingual social media posts from edge devices, including posts exhibiting offensive language and demographic biases (e.g., subtle racial or gender biases), processed locally with NLP-based language and content sensitivity detection.\n\nExpected Output: Federated aggregation produces a global model that significantly reduces biased moderation decisions compared to centralized and standard federated baselines, quantified by bias amplification metrics and offensive content detection accuracy. Privacy loss stays within adaptive, per-client differential privacy budgets aligned with trust and content sensitivity. No raw data or detailed model updates leak.\n\nUser trust scores correlate positively with optimized privacy-utility trade-offs, demonstrating cognitive load-informed personalization benefits.\n\nScenario-specific pseudocode snippets demonstrate local bias correction parameter updates with convergence guarantees and adaptive privacy budget recalculations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated learning convergence or fairness consistency proves suboptimal:\n\n1. Transition to a hybrid federated architecture where trusted execution environments (TEEs) on edge servers secure partial aggregation, increasing model update fidelity while maintaining privacy.\n\n2. Relax privacy budgets selectively for non-sensitive content strata identified via the NLP pipeline to improve model utility, validated through privacy risk analysis.\n\n3. Incorporate robustness-enhancing mechanisms such as fairness regularization or gradient clipping to stabilize convergence.\n\n4. Conduct additional user studies to recalibrate trust metrics and privacy budget adaptation heuristics.\n\nThese fallback strategies will be systematically integrated into the experiment pipeline with performance and privacy trade-offs carefully benchmarked against the primary method."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a federated learning architecture with local personalized bias correction and adaptive privacy budget allocation. However, the mechanism lacks clarity on how bias mitigation models are personalized locally without risking inconsistencies or fairness drifts across clients. The aggregation procedure to synthesize bias mitigation insights without raw data exposure also needs detailed explanation, especially in balancing utility and privacy. The adaptive privacy budget sensitive to trust levels and content sensitivity is promising but requires formalization and justification, as well as addressing practical trust quantification. Improving the mechanistic exposition with concrete algorithmic design, and clarifying privacy-utility trade-offs, will strengthen soundness and reproducibility substantially. Consider including mathematical formulations or pseudocode of the bias correction and budget adaptation processes to solidify the approach's credibility and enable critical evaluation of its assumptions and guarantees. This is critical since federated bias mitigation combined with differential privacy is nontrivial and the core novelty claim depends on this architecture's rigor and clarity (target: Proposed_Method)."

However, it misses concrete details on key scientific and technical challenges critical to feasibility. For instance, how will multilingual and labeled social media data be collected or annotated respecting privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA? How will user trust be quantitatively measured in simulations? The plan also lacks strategies to handle imbalanced demographic and linguistic groups commonly present in social media, which impact bias mitigation and federated learning convergence. Synthetic data testing is helpful but should be supplemented with at least one real federated deployment scenario or user study framework to demonstrate practical viability. Furthermore, the fallback mechanisms are briefly mentioned but not integrated systematically into experimental contingencies. Strengthening the experiment design with clearer dataset sourcing, robust metrics definition, comprehensive baselines reflecting state-of-the-art federated bias mitigation systems, and explicit validation on heterogeneous, realistic data distributions will improve feasibility and credibility (target: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)."

Specifically, leveraging regulatory frameworks like GDPR and California Consumer Privacy Act could contextualize adaptive privacy budget allocation and federated learning privacy guarantees, rendering the system more compliant and practically relevant.
