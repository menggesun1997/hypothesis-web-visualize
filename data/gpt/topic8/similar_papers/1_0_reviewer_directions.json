    "title": "Neuro-Symbolic Commonsense Fusion for Medical LLMs in HRI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs in human-robot interaction (HRI) for healthcare lack robust integration of explicit commonsense and domain expert knowledge, limiting their ethical transparency, context-awareness, and trustworthiness.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical internal gap of missing explicit commonsense knowledge integration and the absence of bridge nodes between language-focused NLP and expert healthcare knowledge. This innovation fuses symbolic knowledge graphs with foundation models, therefore enriching context embedding and enhancing decision support accuracy.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid neuro-symbolic architecture that combines large language models with symbolic commonsense knowledge graphs constructed via automatic knowledge extraction from electronic health records (EHRs). The system dynamically queries the knowledge graph during dialogue to supplement LLM reasoning, enabling transparent, explainable decision-making guided by expert healthcare ontologies and commonsense reasoning modules.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Extract structured knowledge graphs from EHR datasets using named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction. 2) Pretrain/fine-tune LLMs (e.g., GPT, T5) with multi-task objectives incorporating query-answering over the knowledge graph. 3) Implement a neuro-symbolic interface that adaptively queries the graph during generation. 4) Evaluate on patient-robot dialogue datasets for accuracy, contextual coherence, and explainability against standard LLM baselines. 5) Measure trust and transparency via user studies with healthcare professionals.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient description ‘‘I’ve been feeling dizzy after my medication.” Expected Output: LLM consults the underlying knowledge graph indicating the medication’s side effects and responds, ‘‘Dizziness can be a side effect of your medication; would you like me to notify your doctor or adjust your dose?’’ The explanation traces back to the knowledge graph nodes on the medication and symptoms.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic graph querying proves computationally expensive or ineffective, implement a knowledge distillation phase to inject commonsense embeddings directly into the LLM weights. Alternatively, use prompt engineering to incorporate graph summaries in context windows."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a solid multi-phase workflow integrating knowledge extraction, LLM fine-tuning, and neuro-symbolic querying, but it lacks clarity on addressing critical practical challenges: the automatic construction of high-quality, accurate, and comprehensive knowledge graphs from noisy, privacy-sensitive EHR data is highly nontrivial and may require advanced de-identification, domain adaptation, and error correction strategies which are not discussed. Additionally, the plan does not address computational overhead and latency constraints of dynamic querying within real-time HRI settings, especially in healthcare contexts where prompt responsiveness is crucial. It would strengthen feasibility to explicitly incorporate intermediate validation steps for knowledge graph quality and scaling considerations for the neuro-symbolic interface, as well as fallback evaluation metrics for the distillation or prompt-engineering alternatives to ensure graceful degradation if runtime performance bottlenecks emerge. Including such operational contingencies will better demonstrate the experiment plan’s robustness and practical viability in complex healthcare HRI environments.\n\nRecommendation: Detail data preprocessing and knowledge graph validation procedures, benchmark real-time query latencies, and outline performance targets for fallback mechanisms to enhance feasibility confidence in the experiment plan."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment marking this work as NOV-COMPETITIVE, I suggest leveraging related globally-linked concepts to significantly enhance the proposal's impact and differentiate its contribution. Incorporating 'user interface adaptation' and 'human-computer interaction research' perspectives could enable dynamic, personalized explanation delivery to healthcare professionals and patients, thus improving trust and transparency beyond static explainability. Integration of 'data privacy' considerations into the neuro-symbolic framework will address critical ethical constraints in healthcare data usage, offering a compelling, distinctive angle given regulatory pressures. Finally, exploring multi-agent systems or autonomous AI agents for cooperative decision support between robots and clinicians could elevate the applied impact in HRI medical contexts. These global integrations would position the approach not only as a technical neuro-symbolic advance but as a holistic HRI solution addressing practical deployment, user experience, and ethical compliance challenges in healthcare AI environments.\n\nRecommendation: Embed adaptive user interface mechanisms, privacy-preserving knowledge extraction and querying approaches, and multi-agent collaboration scenarios into the research aims to expand novelty and broader applicability."
