    "title": "Prompt Engineering Meets Graph Neural Logic for Enhanced Open-Domain QA",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current prompting strategies lack formal logical structure to guide abductive commonsense inference in LLMs for open-domain QA.",
    "Motivation": "Building on Opportunity 3, this project integrates explicit logical formulae derived from graph neural logic representations into prompt engineering pipelines to enrich LLM reasoning and explanation generation, addressing internal gaps in implicit knowledge reasoning.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop prompts automatically generated from graph neural logic outputs representing commonsense relations and abductive hypotheses. These prompts encode logical constraints and inference patterns, steering LLMs toward logically consistent and abductively plausible answers with traceable justifications.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Use abductive QA datasets. Baselines include manual prompt strategies. Evaluate answer consistency, logical soundness, and explanation quality. Human judges assess abductive plausibility and trustworthiness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'If the lawn is wet, why?' Prompt includes logical constraints about watering systems and weather conditions to guide LLM toward abductive inferences with stepwise explanations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If automatic prompt generation is ineffective, explore fine-tuning LLMs on graph-logic annotated corpora or adopt reinforcement learning to reward logical consistency."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal describes integrating graph neural logic outputs into prompts for LLMs to enforce logical constraints and abductive reasoning. However, the mechanism for translating logic representations into effective prompts is underspecified and may be nontrivial given LLMs' token-based input formats. Clarify how graph neural logic outputs will be encoded as natural language or token sequences that maintain formal logical structure without confusing the LLM. Detail how logical constraints will be operationalized to steer generation and how abductive hypotheses are generated and integrated. Providing an example pipeline with intermediate representations would strengthen confidence in the method's soundness and novelty beyond prior neuro-symbolic prompting approaches, which have only loosely integrated symbolic logic into prompts without formal abductive guidance. Consider also potential challenges due to large-scale LLMs' limited ability to follow complex symbolic constraints solely via prompting, motivating the fallback plans further with more concrete criteria for switching methods or combining approaches within a hybrid framework. This clarity will mitigate risks around the approach's core assumptions and mechanisms, supporting stronger claims of soundness and feasibility. Clarify and expand the methodological details accordingly in the Proposed_Method section."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty is competitive but not groundbreaking, the project could substantially increase its impact and distinctiveness by leveraging neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence techniques from the global concepts list. Specifically, integrating knowledge graph reasoning with the graph neural logic component can enrich the abductive inference with structured knowledge bases, enabling reasoning paths that are both neurally plausible and symbolically interpretable. This could also enhance explainability and trustworthiness of explanations, tying closely with the motivation for logical consistency and abductive plausibility. Moreover, linking the approach to math word problems or visual question answering tasks can provide diverse benchmarks and showcase broader applicability beyond commonsense QA, demonstrating scalability across modalities or task types. Reinforcing the experiment plan with multi-domain datasets from the field of natural language processing research involving textual entailment or domain knowledge of experts can highlight the model's robustness. Incorporating reinforcement learning for model reasoning aligned with axiomatic principles could differentiate the approach from existing static prompt engineering methods, maximizing impact in the current deep learning era. Suggest expanding the project scope in these directions to boost novelty, feasibility, and real-world impact."
