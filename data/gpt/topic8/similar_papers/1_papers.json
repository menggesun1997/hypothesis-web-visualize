    "abstract": "Intelligent decision-making (IDM) is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to automate or augment decision processes. Modern IDM paradigms integrate advanced frameworks to enable intelligent agents to make effective and adaptive choices and decompose complex tasks into manageable steps, such as AI agents and high-level reinforcement learning. Recent advances in multimodal foundation-based approaches unify diverse input modalities-such as vision, language, and sensory data-into a cohesive decision-making process. Foundation models (FMs) have become pivotal in science and industry, transforming decision-making and research capabilities. Their large-scale, multimodal data-processing abilities foster adaptability and interdisciplinary breakthroughs across fields such as healthcare, life sciences, and education. This survey examines IDM's evolution, advanced paradigms with FMs and their transformative impact on decision-making across diverse scientific and industrial domains, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in building efficient, adaptive, and ethical decision systems.",

    "abstract": "The ways people use language can reveal clues to their emotions, social behaviours, thinking styles, cultures and the worlds around them. In the past two decades, research at the intersection of social psychology and computer science has been developing tools to analyse natural language from written or spoken text to better understand social processes and behaviour. The goal of this Review is to provide a brief overview of the methods and data currently being used and to discuss the underlying meaning of what language analyses can reveal in comparison with more traditional methodologies such as surveys or hand-scored language samples.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The modern era of cognitive intelligence in clinical space has led to the rise of 'Medical Cognitive Virtual Agents' (MCVAs) which are labeled as intelligent virtual assistants interacting with users in a context-sensitive and ambient manner. They aim to augment users' cognitive capabilities thereby helping both patients and medical experts in providing personalized healthcare like remote health tracking, emergency healthcare and robotic diagnosis of critical illness, among others. The objective of this study is to explore the technical aspects of MCVA and their relevance in modern healthcare.\nMethods: In this study, a comprehensive and interpretable analysis of MCVAs are presented and their impacts are discussed. A novel system framework prototype based on artificial intelligence for MCVA is presented. Architectural workflow of potential applications of functionalities of MCVAs are detailed. A novel MCVA relevance survey analysis was undertaken during March-April 2023 at Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India to understand the current position of MCVA in society.\nResults: Outcome of the survey delivered constructive results. Majority of people associated with healthcare showed their inclination towards MCVA. The curiosity for MCVA in Urban zone was more than in rural areas. Also, elderly citizens preferred using MCVA more as compared to youths. Medical decision support emerged as the most preferred application of MCVA.\nConclusion: The article established and validated the relevance of MCVA in modern healthcare. The study showed that MCVA is likely to grow in future and can prove to be an effective assistance to medical experts in coming days.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language models are of interest in various domains, including automated driving, where computer vision techniques can accurately detect road users, but where the vehicle sometimes fails to understand context. This study examined the effectiveness of GPT-4V in predicting the level of 'risk' in traffic images as assessed by humans. We used 210 static images taken from a moving vehicle, each previously rated by approximately 650 people. Based on psychometric construct theory and using insights from the self-consistency prompting method, we formulated three hypotheses: (i) repeating the prompt under effectively identical conditions increases validity, (ii) varying the prompt text and extracting a total score increases validity compared to using a single prompt, and (iii) in a multiple regression analysis, the incorporation of object detection features, alongside the GPT-4V-based risk rating, significantly contributes to improving the model's validity. Validity was quantified by the correlation coefficient with human risk scores, across the 210 images. The results confirmed the three hypotheses. The eventual validity coefficient was <i>r</i> = 0.83, indicating that population-level human risk can be predicted using AI with a high degree of accuracy. The findings suggest that GPT-4V must be prompted in a way equivalent to how humans fill out a multi-item questionnaire.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have raised concerns about the ethical, moral, and legal safeguards. There is a pressing need to improve metrics for assessing security and privacy of AI systems and to manage AI technology in a more ethical manner. To address these challenges, an AI Trust Framework and Maturity Model is proposed to enhance trust in the design and management of AI systems. Trust in AI involves an agreed-upon understanding between humans and machines about system performance. The framework utilizes an \"entropy lens\" to root the study in information theory and enhance transparency and trust in \"black box\" AI systems, which lack ethical guardrails. High entropy in AI systems can decrease human trust, particularly in uncertain and competitive environments. The research draws inspiration from entropy studies to improve trust and performance in autonomous human-machine teams and systems, including interconnected elements in hierarchical systems. Applying this lens to improve trust in AI also highlights new opportunities to optimize performance in teams. Two use cases are described to validate the AI framework's ability to measure trust in the design and management of AI systems.",
