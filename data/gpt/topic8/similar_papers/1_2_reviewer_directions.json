    "title": "Continuous Commonsense Learning via Dialogue Entity Recognition Feedback in Medical HRI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current healthcare virtual agents do not adapt commonsense knowledge dynamically from real-time interactions, limiting personalization and the effectiveness of human-robot communication.",
    "Motivation": "Directly tackles the gap of isolated language analysis and virtual agent integration by enabling continuous learning from entity recognition in physician-verified dialogues, enhancing personalization and contextual decision-making in clinical HRI.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an adaptive dialogue system that leverages entity recognition and knowledge summarization modules to incrementally update a commonsense knowledge base. The agent uses this evolving knowledge to personalize interactions and decision support, employing reinforcement learning to optimize dialogue strategies based on expert feedback.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement an entity recognition pipeline fine-tuned on medical dialogue data. 2) Develop online summarization algorithms to extract commonsense insights from new interactions. 3) Integrate reinforcement learning algorithms to update dialogue policy based on expert validation signals. 4) Evaluate on longitudinal patient-robot dialogue datasets measuring personalization improvements, task success rate, and expert satisfaction.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient mentions new symptom not covered before. Output: System recognizes new entity, updates knowledge base, and adapts next dialogue turns accordingly, e.g., ‘‘Noted your new symptom of intermittent chest pain, shall I notify your cardiologist?’’",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time updates degrade performance, implement periodic batch updates of the commonsense knowledge base. Also, fall back to supervised retraining cycles triggered by expert review."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposal outlines a high-level framework involving entity recognition, knowledge summarization, and reinforcement learning for continuous commonsense learning, the exact mechanism how these components interact dynamically remains under-specified. For example, it is unclear how the system decides which recognized entities translate into commonsense knowledge updates, how conflicts or noisy signals are resolved, and how reinforcement learning feedback is precisely integrated with knowledge base updates. Clarifying the data flow, update triggers, and algorithmic details with respect to incremental learning and handling errors would strengthen confidence in the method's soundness and operational clarity. Consider providing concrete algorithm pseudocode or system architecture diagrams to elucidate these mechanisms in the 'Proposed_Method'. This will help reviewers understand feasibility and innovativeness in a competitive area where detailed implementation strategies matter significantly for impact and novelty assessment."

          "feedback_content": "Given the 'novelty' evaluation as only NOV-COMPETITIVE and the globally-linked concepts around human-centered AI, socially interactive agents, and multi-agent systems, the proposal could enhance its impact and distinctiveness by exploring integration of the adaptive commonsense dialogue system within multi-agent clinical environments. For example, enabling the virtual agent to collaborate or negotiate with other AI agents (e.g., scheduling assistants, monitoring agents) or to personalize not only the physician-patient dialogue but also support team workflows could broaden applicability. Additionally, leveraging approaches from intelligent environments and user interface adaptation could ground the system within broader smart healthcare contexts, increasing relevance and interdisciplinary impact. Expanding the scope in this manner may better position the work in top conferences where cross-domain, human-centered AI advances are highly valued."
