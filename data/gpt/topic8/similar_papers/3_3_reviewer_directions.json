    "title": "Semantic Feature-Driven Generative Replay for Privacy-Aware Continual Learning in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Data replay techniques improve continual learning but storing past raw data conflicts with privacy concerns, especially in federated or sensitive domains. There is a need for efficient, privacy-aware replay methods leveraging semantic features in LLM continual adaptation.",
    "Motivation": "This addresses the external novel gap of connecting semantic feature representations with data replay under privacy constraints identified as a hidden bridge in the analysis. It innovates by combining generative replay of semantic feature representations with continual updating, advancing beyond existing replay buffer or raw data storage approaches.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a semantic feature-driven generative replay approach where a generative model (e.g., a lightweight VAE or GAN) learns to generate compressed semantic embeddings of prior data classes instead of raw text. The LLM leverages these generated embeddings in replay during continual learning phases without accessing original data. The semantic generative model is trained jointly with the main LLM but stored and transmitted as benign feature representations, ensuring privacy and communication efficiency. Replay frequency and sampling are dynamically controlled based on importance scores derived from knowledge distillation losses.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select incremental NLP tasks with privacy-sensitive data (e.g., personal conversation datasets). 2) Train base LLM and semantic generative replay models. 3) Perform continual learning experiments comparing standard replay, no replay, and generative semantic replay. 4) Evaluate retention accuracy, privacy leakage risks (via membership inference attacks), and computational cost. 5) Assess scalability with increasing numbers of incremental classes and clients in federated setups.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Scenario: A financial institution updates an LLM with new incremental customer intents while ensuring no raw personal data is stored or shared. The system generates semantic embeddings replayed during training, maintaining intent classification accuracy without privacy compromise.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If generative replay quality is insufficient, try distilling semantic embeddings from larger pretrained encoders or use hybrid replay combining partial raw data for benign classes. Alternatively, investigate differential privacy noise addition combined with replay buffers."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method's core mechanism—training a semantic feature-driven generative replay model jointly with the main LLM—is conceptually sound but lacks sufficient detail on critical aspects. Specifically, the proposal should clarify how semantic embeddings are defined and ensured to preserve task-relevant information while guaranteeing privacy. Additionally, the mechanism to dynamically control replay frequency and sampling based on knowledge distillation losses requires clearer formalization and justification. Defining architectures, training objectives, and privacy guarantees more concretely will significantly strengthen soundness and reproducibility prospects within the design section of Proposed_Methods, making the approach more convincing for adoption and evaluation in privacy-sensitive continual learning contexts especially with LLMs acting on textual embeddings rather than raw data directly. Providing more precise algorithmic descriptions or pseudocode could also improve clarity and robustness in understanding this novel approach’s practicality and theoretical underpinnings at scale in federated or incremental learning setups.  Targeting the Proposed_Method section explicitly for these enhancements is critical to solidify the foundation of the research idea's novelty and validity in competitive settings involving privacy-preserving replay and semantic feature manipulation for LLMs.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the competitive novelty rating and the strong thematic overlap with federated incremental learning and human-centric AI, integrating federated learning (FL) system design explicitly into the research scope would substantially broaden impact and novelty. For example, incorporating a multi-client federated continual learning scenario where semantic generative replay models are collaboratively trained and shared without raw data exchange leverages the concept of federated incremental learning and privacy-preserving model sharing. This integration can align well with emerging human-centric AI requirements by addressing personalized model updates across diverse sensitive domains (e.g., finance, health sensing) while maintaining communication efficiency and privacy. \n\nExplicitly linking and benchmarking the approach under realistic FL system constraints (e.g., communication overhead, client heterogeneity, privacy budgets) and exploring intelligent decision-making strategies for replay scheduling could provide a compelling, novel contribution beyond existing replay buffer or raw data approaches. Positioning the work at this intersection can transform the idea from a narrowly scoped incremental learning method into a robust, scalable privacy-aware continual learning framework for decentralized environments, which is a timely and high-impact direction. Encouraging the authors to leverage the provided globally-linked concepts to structure future extensions or experimental setups is highly recommended for elevating the submission's significance and competitiveness in premier venues.\n\nThis suggestion targets broadening the Problem_Statement, Proposed_Method, and Experiment_Plan sections to strategically integrate federated incremental learning and human-centric AI dimensions, thus enhancing the research’s visibility and relevance in the community."
