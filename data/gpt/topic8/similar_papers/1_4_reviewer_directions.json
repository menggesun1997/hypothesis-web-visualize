    "title": "Expert-Guided Multitask Benchmark for Evaluating Commonsense Integration in Healthcare LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of standardized benchmarks explicitly measuring commonsense knowledge integration and ethical reasoning in medical LLMs for HRI limits research progress and comparison.",
    "Motivation": "Fulfills a major infrastructure gap by providing a unified benchmark derived from expert-annotated dialogues, EHR-derived knowledge graphs, and ethical scenario tests, emphasizing the critical internal and external gaps of knowledge integration and trustworthiness.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multitask benchmark suite combining tasks such as dialogue-based clinical decision support, commonsense inference question answering, ethical compliance classification, and knowledge graph reasoning. Benchmark includes physician-labeled ground truths and scenario-based trust assessment metrics.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect and curate datasets from clinical dialogues, expert annotations, and synthetic ethical dilemmas. 2) Define tasks covering language understanding, knowledge graph reasoning, and ethical safeguards. 3) Create scoring metrics focused on correctness, contextual appropriateness, transparency, and trust. 4) Release benchmark for public evaluation and analyze state-of-the-art LLMs' performance gaps.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Task: Given a patient report with ambiguous symptoms, model must infer plausible commonsense explanations and select ethically sound treatment suggestions matching expert consensus.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If data scarcity arises for some tasks, consider data augmentation using expert-driven simulations or synthetic data creation. Provide modularity to allow incremental task additions later."

To enhance feasibility, the plan should clearly specify how data privacy, consent, and clinical diversity issues will be addressed, detail validation methods for synthetic ethical dilemmas, and embed concrete milestones with resource and timeline estimates to ensure the benchmark's development can be realistically executed within typical research constraints and ethical frameworks. Without this, the ambitious multitask nature risks becoming unmanageable or ethically problematic in practice, undermining the benchmark's reliability and acceptance by the community. This enhancement would bolster the scientific rigor and practical viability of the experimental phase. Target section: Experiment_Plan.  \n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating, the idea stands to gain significant impact and distinctiveness by integrating 'vision-language models' and 'multimodal interactions' into the benchmark. For example, incorporating healthcare robots' perception input (e.g., images or videos of patient environments) alongside dialogue and clinical data could enable evaluation of LLMs' commonsense and ethical reasoning in more lifelike HRI scenarios. Additionally, embedding health equity considerations as a key metric could advance trustworthiness and fairness evaluation within clinical decision support. This global integration would deepen the benchmark's relevance across multiple research domains, increase novelty, and align it with emerging trends in multimodal AI and trustworthy healthcare robotics, broadening its utility and appeal.
