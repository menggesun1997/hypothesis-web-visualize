    "title": "Iterative Theory-of-Mind Explanation Dialogue for LLM QA",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing Explainable AI techniques for LLMs primarily produce shallow, single-turn explanations that fail to build sustained human trust and do not capture iterative, theory-of-mind-driven explanatory dynamics needed for nuanced open-domain QA.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical internal gap where XAI methods lack multi-turn, interactive explanations. Inspired by theory-of-mind frameworks from vision models and CX-ToM, this method brings iterative, user-adaptive explanation dialogues to large-scale language models.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an interactive system where after each LLM answer, a theory-of-mind-enabled explanation module simulates possible user misconceptions and generates personalized counterfactual explanations. Users can ask follow-up 'why' or 'what-if' questions, and the system iteratively refines explanations in a dialogue until satisfactory understanding is achieved. This module employs meta-reasoning over the LLM's internal states, past interaction context, and counterfactual analysis to produce explanations adapting to user beliefs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Use Open-Domain QA datasets enhanced with human explanation dialogues (or collect via crowdworkers). Baseline is static XAI outputs like attention heatmaps. Implement the iterative explanation dialogue with multi-turn user simulation and real human trials. Metrics include user trust/satisfaction, explanation completeness, and response latency. Test generalization across question types and knowledge domains.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input question: \"Why is the sky blue?\" User receives initial answer plus explanation. User asks \"What if it had different gases?\" System generates a counterfactual explanation about atmospheric composition affecting scattering. The interaction continues until the user signals understanding.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-turn explanations overly degrade response time or confuse users, experiment with summarizing iterative explanations into concise, multi-aspect single messages or adding interactive visual explanation aids. Alternatively, limit iteration depth to optimize performance."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed iterative Theory-of-Mind-enabled explanation module is compelling, the mechanism by which it performs meta-reasoning over the LLM's internal states, past interactions, and counterfactual analyses is described at a high level without sufficient clarity or rigor. For example, it is unclear how user misconceptions are detected and modeled, how counterfactual scenarios are generated systematically, or how the system dynamically adapts explanations based on evolving user beliefs. Providing a detailed and concrete computational framework or algorithmic approach would strengthen the soundness of the method. Consider elaborating on the architecture or processes that operationalize these meta-reasoning and theory-of-mind components to ensure reproducibility and clear rationale for expected performance gains and user trust improvements. This will also help clarify assumptions and validate that the method can deliver on its promises rather than relying on conceptual inspiration alone. Thus, please expand the Proposed_Method section with a rigorous, unambiguous description of the explanation dialogue mechanism and how it integrates with LLM internals and user modeling in practice."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan proposes multi-turn human-in-the-loop evaluations with metrics like trust, satisfaction, completeness, and latency, which is appropriate. However, the plan lacks detail on how user misconception simulations and real human dialogues will be reliably conducted and validated. Critical challenges include collecting high-quality explanation dialogues that reflect real user thought processes, designing robust multi-turn user simulators, and balancing latency trade-offs inherent in iterative explanations. Additionally, the plan does not sufficiently discuss statistical power, participant diversity, or how generalization across question types and domains will be operationalized and measured beyond anecdotal examples. Clarify concrete experimental protocols, data collection methods, user simulator design, evaluation criteria, and contingency plans. Also, ensure that quantitative metrics (e.g., statistical significance of trust improvements) will be rigorously used to judge success. Addressing these will bolster feasibility and scientific soundness of the evaluation."
