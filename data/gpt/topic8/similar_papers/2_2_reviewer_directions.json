    "title": "Crossmodal Lifelong Learning for Social Cognition Enhancement in Embodied AI with Clinical and Legal Knowledge Integration",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs currently lack the capability for complex social cognition needed to navigate nuanced ethical and legal decision-making in real-world clinical and forensic settings due to insufficient lifelong crossmodal learning integrating diverse disciplinary knowledge.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the critical external interdisciplinary gap by combining crossmodal lifelong learning with forensic psychiatry and legal knowledge representation, creating socially-aware embodied AI systems capable of evolving world knowledge acquisition and ethical decision support.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a lifelong learning framework where an embodied AI continuously integrates multimodal inputs (language, visual, sensorimotor) with structured clinical and legal knowledge graphs. Incorporate ethical reasoning modules grounded in social cognition theories. Employ curriculum learning to progressively expose the AI to increasingly complex social scenarios with feedback loops enabling continual updating of semantic and pragmatic knowledge representations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compile multimodal datasets spanning clinical interviews, courtroom transcripts, and social interactions. 2) Develop multimodal encoders paired with knowledge graph embedding modules. 3) Train the model on staged tasks from basic social cue recognition up to complex ethical judgments. 4) Evaluate on benchmarks measuring social cognition abilities, legal reasoning accuracy, and clinical decision support performance. 5) Deploy ablation studies to test lifelong learning efficacy and knowledge transfer.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Video and transcript of a forensic interview where subtle body language and speech imply deception about a crime. Output: AI assessment integrating visual and linguistic cues with legal statutes to form an ethically and legally sound risk evaluation report.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If knowledge integration proves brittle, modularize clinical and legal knowledge representations for separate training with later fusion layers. Alternatively, leverage continual pretraining on domain-specific corpora to stabilize knowledge accumulation."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an ambitious lifelong learning framework integrating multimodal inputs with clinical and legal knowledge graphs and ethical reasoning modules. However, critical components need clearer specification: how exactly the lifelong learning updates and integrates these heterogeneous knowledge sources in real-time remains underspecified; the mechanisms for integrating social cognition theories into ethical reasoning modules are not detailed, risking conceptual vagueness; curriculum learning and feedback loops are referenced but lack concrete algorithmic or architectural designs, making it challenging to assess the method's internal coherence and robustness. Clarify these procedural and modeling details to strengthen the soundness of your approach and enable reproducibility and evaluation by others in the field. Consider providing schematic diagrams or pseudo-code illustrating key algorithmic steps, knowledge updating strategies, and crossmodal integration processes to concretize your design assumptions and mechanisms in the Proposed_Method section."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Experiment_Plan proposes a sequence from dataset compilation through multitask training to evaluation and ablation studies, which is conceptually sound and aligns with the method's goals. Nonetheless, the feasibility is questionable without more concrete planning details: multimodal datasets encompassing clinical interviews, courtroom transcripts, and social interactions are scarce, sensitive, and challenging to acquire and annotate for ethical and legal nuances, threatening data availability and model training; no discussion is provided on data privacy, patient consent, or legal restrictions, which critically affect the feasibility of these experiments; the plan lacks risk mitigation strategies for dataset shortcomings, such as constructing synthetic or simulated data; the progressive task complexity schedule and feedback loop mechanisms are not operationalized in experimental terms, impairing the reproducibility and practical validation of the lifelong learning claims. Address these concerns by detailing data sources, ethical approvals, annotation schemes, and fallback data strategies, strengthening experiment viability. Providing initial data samples or synthetic data protocols and explicit curriculum incremental complexity criteria would improve confidence in practical execution."
