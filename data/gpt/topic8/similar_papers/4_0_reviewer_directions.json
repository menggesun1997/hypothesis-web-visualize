    "title": "Cross-Contextual Ethical Auditing Frameworks for LLMs in Social Media Moderation",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of integrative frameworks that dynamically audit ethical implications and biases of LLMs across diverse sociocultural contexts during social media content moderation, resulting in siloed and static evaluations that fail to generalize or adapt.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical gap of siloed treatment of ethical challenges, privacy, and sociocultural contexts by proposing a framework that integrates these factors dynamically, enabling auditing mechanisms tailored to diverse contexts as identified in the critical gaps section.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-layered auditing framework that combines real-time cultural context embeddings, privacy calculus theories, and bias detection modules to evaluate LLM outputs dynamically. The system employs federated learning to collect anonymized contextual feedback from multiple geographic regions, integrating sociocultural norms and privacy preferences into the auditing process, and uses explainable AI methods to surface potential ethical breaches or biases in content moderation decisions.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate a cross-cultural social media dataset with annotated content reflecting diverse ethical norms. 2. Implement the multi-layered auditing framework integrated with a state-of-the-art LLM moderating social content. 3. Compare performance against baseline static auditing tools focusing only on bias detection. 4. Evaluate metrics including bias mitigation effectiveness, false positive/negative rates, user trust through surveys, and privacy preservation measured through information leakage analysis.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A social media post containing culturally sensitive political commentary that may be flagged differently in Western vs. East Asian contexts. Expected Output: The auditing framework flags potential bias in content moderation decisions reflecting different cultural norms and provides an explanation for context-dependent moderation decisions, preserving user privacy and fairness.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic auditing proves too resource-intensive, fallback to modular offline assessments incorporating periodic cultural updates. Additionally, reduce dimensionality of context embeddings or switch to rule-based ethical constraints if federated learning data collection faces privacy hurdles."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed multi-layered auditing framework combines cultural context embeddings, privacy calculus theories, bias detection, federated learning, and explainable AI, but it lacks detailed clarity on how these components will be integrated technically and how they interact dynamically in real-time. The explanation should include the architecture design, data flow, specific modeling techniques for embeddings and bias detection, and how federated learning will be orchestrated to securely and efficiently update context models across regions. Clarifying these elements will improve perceived soundness and reproducibility of the approach, ensuring the mechanism is well reasoned rather than an abstract conceptual proposal, thus helping reviewers and implementers assess feasibility and correctness more concretely. Without this, the idea risks being seen as overly high-level or conceptually scattered rather than a grounded, implementable system as currently described in the Proposed_Method section, which is critical before conducting experiments or claiming impact potentials. Please provide more technical specifics and system-level design sketches within your method description to improve soundness and clarity of your core methodological contributions and assumptions about integration complexity and dynamic operation constraints in real-world social media moderation scenarios where latency and data privacy must be balanced carefully with auditing depth and fidelity."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "While the experiment plan thoughtfully includes dataset curation, integration, baseline comparison, multidimensional metrics including bias mitigation, user trust, and privacy evaluation, it omits important practical considerations such as how to reliably annotate and validate cross-cultural ethical norms at scale, the method for continuous ground truth updates for dynamic auditing accuracy, and the feasibility of conducting federated learning across heterogeneous social media platforms with varying data policies and technical ecosystems. Also missing is a detailed risk mitigation and fallback operationalization protocol under resource constraints and privacy challenges as outlined in the Fallback_Plan section. Addressing the complexity of assembling culturally grounded annotations, validating ethical audit assessments rigorously over time, and verifying the federated learning pipeline's security and efficiency are essential experimental planning elements that determine feasibility. You should elaborate on measures to handle annotation biases, domain shifts, scalability of real-time auditing, and legal compliance issues across regions, ensuring the experiment plan is not only conceptually sound but practically executable to support your claims robustly."
