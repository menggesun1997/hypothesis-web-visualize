This study examined the effectiveness of GPT-4V in predicting the level of 'risk' in traffic images as assessed by humans. We used 210 static images taken from a moving vehicle, each previously rated by approximately 650 people. Based on psychometric construct theory and using insights from the self-consistency prompting method, we formulated three hypotheses: (i) repeating the prompt under effectively identical conditions increases validity, (ii) varying the prompt text and extracting a total score increases validity compared to using a single prompt, and (iii) in a multiple regression analysis, the incorporation of object detection features, alongside the GPT-4V-based risk rating, significantly contributes to improving the model's validity. Validity was quantified by the correlation coefficient with human risk scores, across the 210 images. The results confirmed the three hypotheses. The eventual validity coefficient was <i>r</i> = 0.83, indicating that population-level human risk can be predicted using AI with a high degree of accuracy. The findings suggest that GPT-4V must be prompted in a way equivalent to how humans fill out a multi-item questionnaire.\"}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Targeting Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Algorithms in Health Care to Reduce Bias and Improve Population Health', 'abstract': 'Policy Points Artificial intelligence (AI) is disruptively innovating health care and surpassing our ability to define its boundaries and roles in health care and regulate its application in legal and ethical ways. Significant progress has been made in governance in the United States and the European Union. It is incumbent on developers, end users, the public, providers, health care systems, and policymakers to collaboratively ensure that we adopt a national AI health strategy that realizes the Quintuple Aim; minimizes race-based medicine; prioritizes transparency, equity, and algorithmic vigilance; and integrates the patient and community voices throughout all aspects of AI development and deployment.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) Trust Framework and Maturity Model: Applying an Entropy Lens to Improve Security, Privacy, and Ethical AI', 'abstract': 'Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have raised concerns about the ethical, moral, and legal safeguards. There is a pressing need to improve metrics for assessing security and privacy of AI systems and to manage AI technology in a more ethical manner. To address these challenges, an AI Trust Framework and Maturity Model is proposed to enhance trust in the design and management of AI systems. Trust in AI involves an agreed-upon understanding between humans and machines about system performance. The framework utilizes an \"entropy lens\" to root the study in information theory and enhance transparency and trust in \"black box\" AI systems, which lack ethical guardrails. High entropy in AI systems can decrease human trust, particularly in uncertain and competitive environments. The research draws inspiration from entropy studies to improve trust and performance in autonomous human-machine teams and systems, including interconnected elements in hierarchical systems. Applying this lens to improve trust in AI also highlights new opportunities to optimize performance in teams. Two use cases are described to validate the AI framework\\'s ability to measure trust in the design and management of AI systems.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "title": "Evaluating the Integration of Commonsense Knowledge in LLMs for Human-Robot Interaction: Research Landscape Map",
    "current_research_landscape": "The core focus of this research cluster revolves around leveraging natural language processing (NLP) — particularly the analysis of spoken and written language samples — to enhance user cognitive capabilities and healthcare delivery via intelligent virtual agents. The literature emphasizes using foundation models and multimodal AI systems to interpret complex language inputs for decision-making in healthcare contexts. Central to these studies are natural language processing techniques aligned with modern healthcare applications, where virtual agents assist medical experts by augmenting cognitive tasks, personalized healthcare, and decision support. Dominant paradigms include foundation models applied for multimodal integration, virtual agent frameworks in clinical scenarios, and language analysis tools to better understand human behavior and social processes. These paradigms collectively aim to create intelligent systems capable of interpreting nuanced human language to improve interaction quality and healthcare outcomes.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps stem from a lack of explicit integration of commonsense knowledge within large language models (LLMs) directed at human-robot interaction, specifically in healthcare virtual agents. Despite progress, current AI trust frameworks and intelligent decision-making systems reveal limitations in ethical transparency, context understanding, and embedding domain expert knowledge robustly within natural language processing pipelines. Moreover, the absence of bridge nodes between thematic clusters (language-focused NLP and medical virtual agents) indicates a missed integration of nuanced linguistic understanding directly with expert-driven healthcare knowledge. Externally, the GPS global context uncovers a promising hidden bridge linking 'language samples' and 'medical experts' through advanced knowledge extraction methods such as knowledge graph construction, entity recognition, and summarization tasks tied to electronic health records. This connection remains underexplored locally but offers critical potential to embed expert domain knowledge and commonsense reasoning into LLM-driven virtual agents, addressing limitations in explainability, personalization, and contextual decision-making in human-robot interaction.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate automatic knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction techniques (from Global Hidden Bridge) with natural language processing modules in medical virtual agents (Local Thematic Island) to enrich large language models with structured commonsense healthcare knowledge, addressing the internal gap of limited domain-specific context embedding and enhancing decision support accuracy.\n\nOpportunity 2: Develop hybrid frameworks combining foundation models’ multimodal decision-making capabilities (Part A) with summarization and reasoning approaches tailored for physician-labeled electronic health record language samples (Global Opportunity), to improve the interpretability, transparency, and trustworthiness of AI agents in patient-robot interactions, thus advancing the AI Trust Framework and ethical safeguards gap.\n\nOpportunity 3: Employ dialogue summarization and entity recognition methods from the global research frontier to bridge the current isolation between language analysis methods and virtual agents in healthcare, fostering continuous learning systems that adapt commonsense knowledge dynamically from expert verified language data, enhancing human-robot interaction effectiveness and personalization in real-world clinical settings."
