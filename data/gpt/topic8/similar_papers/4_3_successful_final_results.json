    "Problem_Statement": "Existing prompt engineering techniques inadequately address hallucination and ethical guardrails for multilingual, culturally diverse LLMs used in social media moderation, particularly for non-Western languages such as Chinese.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap around hallucination and contextual ethical guardrails in diverse linguistic models by creatively fusing prompt engineering with sociocultural contextual modeling and privacy technologies to dynamically adapt prompts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an adaptive prompt generation system that leverages cultural knowledge graphs and user privacy profiles to generate context-tailored prompts minimizing hallucinations. The system dynamically adjusts prompt structures based on detected sociocultural context, integrating privacy-preserving filters ensuring ethical compliance with local norms and user preferences.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Gather multilingual social media datasets including Chinese and other underrepresented languages with annotations for hallucination incidences. 2. Develop baseline prompt engineering approaches and compare with adaptive prompt system that incorporates cultural context vectors and privacy filters. 3. Evaluate hallucination frequency, moderation bias, user satisfaction, and cultural appropriateness.",

        "title": "Dynamic Socioculturally Adaptive Prompt Engineering for Hallucination Reduction in Multilingual LLMs with Educational and HCI Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing prompt engineering methods inadequately address hallucination reduction and ethical guardrails for multilingual large language models (LLMs) deployed in culturally diverse social media and educational contexts, especially for underrepresented non-Western languages such as Chinese. Current approaches lack explicit mechanisms to dynamically integrate sociocultural knowledge with user privacy preferences, and their applicability beyond moderation, such as in language education and human-computer interaction (HCI), remains unexplored.",
        "Motivation": "To bridge a critical gap in safe, contextually aware AI usage, this research advances an adaptive prompt engineering framework that not only mitigates hallucinations and enforces ethical guardrails across diverse languages but also innovatively expands impact through integration with language education and human-computer interaction domains. By designing prompts informed by dynamic sociocultural context and incorporating privacy considerations, the approach addresses both the technical challenge of hallucination and the societal importance of culturally respectful AI. Furthermore, aligning with educational practices and HCI theory enables broad interdisciplinary applicability, fostering AI tools that enhance multilingual learning, digital content moderation, and user engagement in varied educational environments. This positions our solution to stand out amid existing methods by explicitly fusing cultural knowledge, privacy, and educational utility in a rigorously specified mechanism.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel Dynamic Socioculturally Adaptive Prompt Engineering (DSAPE) system with a hybrid modular architecture combining: 1) Cultural Knowledge Integration Module (CKIM) that encodes and updates cultural context via multilingual, domain-specific knowledge graphs and culturally nuanced embeddings fine-tuned on local corpora; 2) Privacy Profile Manager (PPM) that dynamically maps individual user privacy preferences and local ethical norms through privacy-preserving federated learning mechanisms; 3) Prompt Adaptation Engine (PAE) that algorithmically fuses CKIM and PPM outputs using a context-weighted gating mechanism to generate adaptive prompts tailored for each sociocultural and privacy context; and 4) Educational and HCI Interface Layer (EHIL) that contextualizes prompt outputs for diverse use cases, including social moderation and interactive language learning environments. \n\nConcretely, the PAE implements an algorithmic workflow where, for each user query, it: \n(a) extracts cultural context vectors C_t from CKIM,\n(b) retrieves user privacy and ethical compliance vectors P_t from PPM,\n(c) computes adaptive prompt weights W_t = sigmoid(α*C_t + β*P_t), where α and β are tunable hyperparameters learned during training,\n(d) combines baseline prompt templates with W_t to output a custom prompt minimizing hallucination risk and maximizing ethical compliance.\n\nWe operationalize hallucination reduction quantitatively via precision and factuality metrics comparing generated outputs against verified annotated datasets, and ethical compliance via cross-validated sociocultural appropriateness scores. This transparent architectural design and algorithmic clarity facilitate reproducibility and systematic evaluation.\n\nInnovatively, the EHIL extends the system to support language teacher education programs and foreign language learning by adapting prompts to pedagogical objectives and learner interaction patterns, enabling HCI-informed feedback loops that measure and optimize learner engagement and content comprehension. This modular integration with educational practice and HCI not only broadens societal impact but also offers novel research pathways at the intersection of AI assistance, language education, and ethical multilingual AI deployment.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Collection: Assemble a multilingual corpus including Chinese and other underrepresented languages spanning social media posts with hallucination annotations and educational language learning dialogues annotated for engagement and pedagogical relevance.\n2. Module Development: Build and pretrain CKIM using public and curated cultural knowledge graphs and fine-tune embeddings on relevant corpora. Develop PPM using federated learning approaches to encode privacy preferences respecting local norms.\n3. Algorithm Implementation: Implement the Prompt Adaptation Engine with gated context-weighted computations and integrate EHIL to interface with both social media moderation and language education platforms.\n4. Baseline Comparison: Develop baseline static prompt engineering models without sociocultural or privacy adaptation.\n5. Evaluation Metrics: Measure hallucination frequency (precision/factuality), ethical compliance (human expert cultural appropriateness rating), learner engagement (interaction logs and surveys), and moderation bias.\n6. User Studies: Conduct controlled studies with bilingual users and language learners interacting through the EHIL layer, assessing perceived prompt relevance, trust, and educational effectiveness.\n7. Iterative Refinement: Use feedback to refine hyperparameters α, β and update modules, ensuring both high performance and scalability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A Chinese social media post using ambiguous idiomatic expression with potential privacy sensitivities.\nExpected Output: The system generates a culturally aware, privacy-respecting prompt that guides the LLM to produce factual, non-hallucinated moderation feedback compliant with local norms.\n\nInput: An English learner using the system for language practice encountering culturally nuanced content.\nExpected Output: The system adapts prompts to scaffold understanding, incorporating culturally relevant examples and explanations, optimizing learner engagement and comprehension as measured by interaction metrics and post-session quizzes.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If integration of large-scale cultural knowledge graphs proves infeasible, fallback to leveraging pretrained contextual embeddings fine-tuned extensively on available cultural corpora to approximate cultural context representation. If privacy-preserving federated learning limits real-time responsiveness or model performance, adaptively relax privacy thresholds in non-sensitive categories with explicit user opt-in mechanisms to maintain balance between ethical compliance and system efficacy. Additionally, if educational and HCI interface integration complexity delays deployment, prioritize a phased rollout starting with social media moderation use cases, progressively incorporating educational functionalities based on user feedback and resource availability."

Clarify mechanisms for integrating cultural knowledge with privacy profiles, specify the adaptation process, and describe how ethical compliance and hallucination reduction are quantitatively operationalized within the system's workflow to strengthen soundness and reproducibility of the approach. Provide concrete algorithmic or architectural design sketches or pseudo-code to elucidate this novel fusion clearly and reduce ambiguity about feasibility and effectiveness in practice. This will help reviewers and practitioners assess the scientific and technical credibility of the proposed solution thoroughly and enable stronger evaluation in experiments, which is critical for a competitive area like this one under the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty status. This also reduces potential risks that core assumptions about system behavior under varied sociocultural contexts remain unsupported due to vagueness in method descriptions, addressing implicit [SOU-ASSUMPTION] concerns tied to mechanism clarity as well, but focusing here on specification of the mechanisms explicitly is primary to improve the proposal quality and confidence in novelty claims.

For example, extending your adaptive prompt engineering approach to support language education or digital library content moderation in diverse educational contexts could substantially broaden impact while driving novel interdisciplinary applications. Partnering with 'language teacher education programs' or 'language learning' researchers might enable new use cases for your system beyond social media moderation, increasing societal usefulness and appeal to a wider audience. You could incorporate evaluation metrics related to language pedagogy effectiveness or learner engagement in multilingual environments, tying your technical advances to measurable educational outcomes. This would heighten both the novelty and impact values, addressing the challenge of a competitive niche by grounding your work in broader human-centered contexts.
