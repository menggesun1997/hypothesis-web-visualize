Prompt engineering is the process of structuring inputs, and it has emerged as a crucial technique for maximizing the utility and accuracy of these models. Both foundational and advanced prompt engineering methodologies-including techniques such as self-consistency, chain of thought, and generated knowledge, which can significantly enhance the performance of models-are explored in this paper. Additionally, the prompt methods for vision language models (VLMs) are examined in detail. Prompt methods are evaluated with subjective and objective metrics, ensuring a robust analysis of their efficacy. Critical to this discussion is the role of prompt engineering in artificial intelligence (AI) security, particularly in terms of defending against adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs. Strategies for minimizing these risks and improving the robustness of models are thoroughly reviewed. Finally, we provide a perspective for future research and applications.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': ': Visualizing and Understanding Commonsense Reasoning Capabilities of Natural Language Models', 'abstract': \"Recently, large pretrained language models have achieved compelling performance on commonsense benchmarks. Nevertheless, it is unclear what commonsense knowledge the models learn and whether they solely exploit spurious patterns. Feature attributions are popular explainability techniques that identify important input concepts for model outputs. However, commonsense knowledge tends to be implicit and rarely explicitly presented in inputs. These methods cannot infer models' implicit reasoning over mentioned concepts. We present CommonsenseVIS, a visual explanatory system that utilizes external commonsense knowledge bases to contextualize model behavior for commonsense question-answering. Specifically, we extract relevant commonsense knowledge in inputs as references to align model behavior with human knowledge. Our system features multi-level visualization and interactive model probing and editing for different concepts and their underlying relations. Through a user study, we show that CommonsenseVIS helps NLP experts conduct a systematic and scalable visual analysis of models' relational reasoning over concepts in different situations.\"}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'CX-ToM: Counterfactual explanations with theory-of-mind for enhancing human trust in image recognition models', 'abstract': \"We propose <i>CX-ToM</i>, short for counterfactual explanations with theory-of-mind, a new explainable AI (XAI) framework for explaining decisions made by a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to the current methods in XAI that generate explanations as a single shot response, we pose explanation as an iterative communication process, i.e., dialogue between the machine and human user. More concretely, our CX-ToM framework generates a sequence of explanations in a dialogue by mediating the differences between the minds of the machine and human user. To do this, we use Theory of Mind (ToM) which helps us in explicitly modeling the human's intention, the machine's mind as inferred by the human, as well as human's mind as inferred by the machine. Moreover, most state-of-the-art XAI frameworks provide attention (or heat map) based explanations. In our work, we show that these attention-based explanations are not sufficient for increasing human trust in the underlying CNN model. In CX-ToM, we instead use counterfactual explanations called <i>fault-lines</i> which we define as follows: given an input image <i>I</i> for which a CNN classification model <i>M</i> predicts class <i>c</i> <sub><i>pred</i></sub> , a fault-line identifies the minimal semantic-level features (e.g., <i>stripes</i> on zebra), referred to as explainable concepts, that need to be added to or deleted from <i>I</i> to alter the classification category of <i>I</i> by <i>M</i> to another specified class <i>c</i> <sub><i>alt</i></sub> . Extensive experiments verify our hypotheses, demonstrating that our CX-ToM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art XAI models.\"}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Usable XAI: 10 Strategies Towards Exploiting Explainability in the LLM Era', 'abstract': \"Explainable AI (XAI) refers to techniques that provide human-understandable\\ninsights into the workings of AI models.

However, LLMs are black-box models, which often fall short of capturing and accessing factual knowledge. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Wikipedia, and Huapu for example, are structured knowledge models that explicitly store rich factual knowledge. KGs can enhance LLMs by providing external knowledge for inference and interpretability. Meanwhile, KGs are difficult to construct and evolve by nature, which challenges the existing methods in KGs to generate new facts and represent unseen knowledge. Therefore, it is complementary to unify LLMs and KGs together and, simultaneously, leverage their advantages. In this article, we present a forward-looking roadmap for the unification of LLMs and KGs. Our roadmap consists of three general frameworks, namely: 1) KG-enhanced LLMs, which incorporate KGs during the pre-training and inference phases of LLMs, or for the purpose of enhancing understanding of the knowledge learned by LLMs; 2) LLM-augmented KGs, that leverage LLMs for different KG tasks such as embedding, completion, construction, graph-to-text generation, and question answering; and 3) Synergized LLMs + KGs, in which LLMs and KGs play equal roles and work in a mutually beneficial way to enhance both LLMs and KGs for bidirectional reasoning driven by both data and knowledge.

Addressing this issue, our study introduces a novel integration of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) as Cross-lingual Readers in information retrieval systems, specifically targeting the complexities of cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR). We present an innovative approach: Activation Steered Multilingual Retrieval (ASMR) that employs \"steering activations\\'\\'-a method to adjust and direct the LLM\\'s focus-enhancing its ability to understand user queries and generate accurate, language-coherent responses. ASMR adeptly combines a Multilingual Dense Passage Retrieval (mDPR) system with an LLM, overcoming the limitations of traditional search engines in handling diverse linguistic inputs. This approach is particularly effective in managing the nuances and intricacies inherent in various languages. Rigorous testing on established benchmarks such as XOR-TyDi QA, and MKQA demonstrates that ASMR not only meets but surpasses existing standards in CLIR, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

    "current_research_landscape": "The central focus of this research cluster is understanding and enhancing how large language models (LLMs), especially pre-trained language models within natural language processing, encode and utilize semantic encyclopedic and commonsense knowledge for improved reasoning and question answering. Core themes include Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies that aim to make the inner workings of these complex models interpretable and trustworthy for human users, with a particular interest in techniques like counterfactual explanations and interactive explanation dialogues to improve human trust. Additionally, convolutional neural networks emerge as key when considering cross-modal or related visual reasoning connections, although primarily as a comparative or foundational baseline. The cluster tightly integrates commonsense knowledge bases as vital external resources to contextualize reasoning, alongside prompt engineering and knowledge graph fusion approaches to augment or steer LLMs. Dominant methods include XAI techniques tailored for LLMs, knowledge graph-enhanced pre-training and inference, prompt engineering strategies for improved knowledge retrieval and reasoning, and leveraging external structured knowledge to ground and explain model predictions.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: A critical limitation lies in the lack of effective bridging between internal model semantic representations and external explicit knowledge bases, hindering transparent and robust semantic encoding of encyclopedic knowledge. The absence of identified bridge nodes in the local concept network highlights a fragmentation between key paradigms such as Explainable AI and commonsense knowledge integration. Moreover, existing XAI techniques often provide shallow or one-shot explanations that fail to capture the iterative, theory-of-mind-driven explanatory processes needed for deeper human trust. Limitations also exist in evaluating the implicit versus explicit knowledge captured by LLMs within open-domain contexts. External/Novel Gaps: Global second-order co-occurrence analysis reveals underexplored opportunities to connect convolutional neural networks with commonsense knowledge and XAI for multi-modal semantic understanding. For example, graph neural networks (GNNs) and graph convolutional networks could serve as powerful, structured intermediaries to unify and interpret semantic knowledge embedded in LLMs. Additionally, the blend of legal reasoning, abductive logic, and dynamic explanation models from other domains offers a promising hidden bridge to improve XAI's handling of incomplete commonsense knowledge and nuanced open-domain QA. The integration of theory-of-mind inspired, interactive explanation frameworks used in vision models with large-scale language models remains an untapped path to foster iterative human-machine dialogue in explanations.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Leverage graph convolutional networks and graph neural networks (from Global Context) as explicit structured intermediaries to connect LLM semantic encodings with external commonsense knowledge bases (Local thematic cluster), addressing the internal gap in transparent semantic grounding and interpretability highlighted by current XAI limitations (Part A). This would unify symbolic and sub-symbolic representations, improving knowledge retrieval and reasoning fidelity in open-domain QA.\n\nOpportunity 2: Integrate theory-of-mind based counterfactual explanation frameworks (inspired by CX-ToM from paper 3) with LLM Explainable AI techniques (local XAI methodologies) to establish an iterative, dialogue-driven explanation system for LLMs. This novel approach addresses the known internal gap of one-shot explanations failing to build sustained human trust and could benefit from cross-modal insights derived from CNN Explainable AI research (hidden bridge).\n\nOpportunity 3: Combine prompt engineering strategies with abductive reasoning and logical frameworks from legal reasoning domains (identified as hidden bridges) to enrich LLM semantic encoding with abductive commonsense inference capabilities. This cross-disciplinary fusion targets the gap in implicit commonsense knowledge reasoning and the challenge of capturing incomplete or evolving knowledge bases, thus enhancing open-domain question answering robustness and explainability."
