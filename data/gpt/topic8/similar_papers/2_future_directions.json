        "title": "Developmental Semantics for Dynamic Risk Assessment in Forensic Psychiatry AI Agents",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs struggle to dynamically update their knowledge with accurate, context-sensitive information particularly in forensic psychiatry risk assessments, where precise semantic understanding of complex psychological states and social context is critical.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal critical gap in dynamically updating knowledge bases for safety-critical scenarios, and leverages the hidden bridge linking developmental robotics with semantic latent analysis and dangerousness assessment to enhance adaptability and interpretability in forensic psychiatric evaluations.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an embodied AI agent architecture integrating developmental robotics principles with a semantic latent representation learner adapted to forensic psychiatric data. The agent will continuously learn and refine risk assessments via embodied interaction simulations and real case data streams. A continual learning module will dynamically update latent semantic patterns reflecting evolving psychiatric knowledge and legal guidelines. Interpretability is enhanced by semantic concept disentanglement aligned with risk factors.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect forensic psychiatry datasets including clinical notes and legal rulings. 2) Pretrain baseline LLM and latent semantic models on general psychiatry and law corpora. 3) Implement embodied simulation environment modeling patient-agent interactions. 4) Train the developmental agent on simulated and real data with dynamic updating enabled. 5) Evaluate risk assessment accuracy, knowledge freshness, and model interpretability against static baselines using metrics like F1, BLEU for explanations, and concept drift detection.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical note describing a patient with emerging psychopathic traits and recent noncompliance with medication. Output: Risk assessment score with transparent semantic rationale highlighting key risk factors and newly updated knowledge from recent legal precedent impacting decision-making.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic updating destabilizes performance, freeze parts of the latent semantic core and incrementally update policy layers. Alternatively, augment data with semi-synthetic cases to stabilize learning curves and introduce hierarchical attention mechanisms to improve semantic disentanglement."

        "title": "Language-Guided Simulation Framework for Rare Autonomous Driving Scenarios Using Foundation Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "Autonomous driving systems fail to robustly handle long-tail, rare traffic scenarios due to scarcity of labeled data and insufficient contextual understanding in current simulation frameworks.",
        "Motivation": "Directly responds to the external gap identified by linking language model methodologies with autonomous driving datasets to simulate rare scenarios. The innovation lies in leveraging powerful language foundation models to guide scenario generation and scene understanding, offering unprecedented coverage and realism in training autonomous agents under uncertainty.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a hybrid simulation platform where a language foundation model generates natural language descriptions of rare traffic events and guides scene composition by conditioning on multimodal driving data. Integrate a semantic scene generator driven by language prompts and an LLM-based evaluator that iteratively refines scenario difficulty and plausibility. The system facilitates scalable generation of annotated rare-event datasets for robust policy training.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather and curate autonomous driving datasets featuring rare events. 2) Fine-tune a large language foundation model to generate scenario descriptions reflecting real-world traffic edge cases. 3) Develop a multimodal scene synthesis engine that translates language prompts into rich driving environment simulations. 4) Use generated scenarios to retrain autonomous driving perception and planning modules. 5) Evaluate improvements on rare-event detection, false-positive reduction, and safety-critical intervention timing, comparing with standard simulated datasets.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt - \"A pedestrian suddenly steps onto the crosswalk from behind a parked truck on a rainy evening.\" Output: A simulated driving scene with occlusions and weather effects requiring urgent braking decisions, accompanied by annotated sensor data and system reactions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct language-to-scene translation is challenging, introduce intermediate semantic templates or scene graph generation as scaffolding. Incorporate human-in-the-loop refinement to iteratively improve scenario realism and alignment with safety objectives."

        "title": "Crossmodal Lifelong Learning for Social Cognition Enhancement in Embodied AI with Clinical and Legal Knowledge Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLMs currently lack the capability for complex social cognition needed to navigate nuanced ethical and legal decision-making in real-world clinical and forensic settings due to insufficient lifelong crossmodal learning integrating diverse disciplinary knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the critical external interdisciplinary gap by combining crossmodal lifelong learning with forensic psychiatry and legal knowledge representation, creating socially-aware embodied AI systems capable of evolving world knowledge acquisition and ethical decision support.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a lifelong learning framework where an embodied AI continuously integrates multimodal inputs (language, visual, sensorimotor) with structured clinical and legal knowledge graphs. Incorporate ethical reasoning modules grounded in social cognition theories. Employ curriculum learning to progressively expose the AI to increasingly complex social scenarios with feedback loops enabling continual updating of semantic and pragmatic knowledge representations.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compile multimodal datasets spanning clinical interviews, courtroom transcripts, and social interactions. 2) Develop multimodal encoders paired with knowledge graph embedding modules. 3) Train the model on staged tasks from basic social cue recognition up to complex ethical judgments. 4) Evaluate on benchmarks measuring social cognition abilities, legal reasoning accuracy, and clinical decision support performance. 5) Deploy ablation studies to test lifelong learning efficacy and knowledge transfer.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Video and transcript of a forensic interview where subtle body language and speech imply deception about a crime. Output: AI assessment integrating visual and linguistic cues with legal statutes to form an ethically and legally sound risk evaluation report.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If knowledge integration proves brittle, modularize clinical and legal knowledge representations for separate training with later fusion layers. Alternatively, leverage continual pretraining on domain-specific corpora to stabilize knowledge accumulation."
