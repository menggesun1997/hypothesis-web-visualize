    "title": "Abductive Commonsense Prompting with Legal Reasoning Frameworks",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs struggle with implicit commonsense reasoning and managing incomplete or evolving knowledge bases, limiting robustness in open-domain QA and explainability.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by hidden bridges linking legal abductive logic frameworks with prompt engineering, this project injects abductive inference mechanisms into LLM prompting strategies to enhance reasoning on incomplete knowledge, targeting the internal gap in semantic encoding and abductive reasoning.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a prompt engineering paradigm that integrates abductive inference templates drawn from legal reasoning (case-based and logic-based argumentation) to guide LLMs to generate plausible hypotheses and fill knowledge gaps during QA. The approach incorporates logical constraint prompts to steer abductive commonsense reasoning and produce justifiable answers with inferred assumptions.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Use datasets requiring abductive reasoning (e.g., abductive NLI). Compare basic LLM prompt approaches vs abductive legal-style prompting. Metrics include correctness, abductive justification quality, and explanation relevance. Conduct human evaluation of reasoning plausibility and robustness under incomplete info. Experiment with dynamic prompt updating based on feedback.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'The floor is wet. Why?' The model outputs: 'Because someone spilled water or it rained recently,' providing abductive reasoning filling incomplete info and explicit justifications.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If pure prompt engineering is insufficient, augment with a lightweight abductive reasoning module external to the LLM that proposes hypothesis candidates post-hoc. Alternatively, blend symbolic abductive solvers with LLM outputs to cross-validate answers."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan should more concretely address how the abductive legal-style prompting will be quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated beyond comparative correctness metrics. For example, precise operationalization criteria for \"abductive justification quality\" and \"explanation relevance\" need definition to ensure replicable and rigorous assessment. Furthermore, the plan should clarify dataset selection breadth and scale, robustness testing protocols under incomplete info, and detail the human evaluation methodology, including evaluator expertise and inter-rater agreement measures. Without these clarifications, assessing feasibility and scientific rigor is difficult, risking inconclusive or noisy experimental results that undermine the proposed approach’s validation and acceptance in competitive peer review environments. Strengthening the experimental design will therefore improve the feasibility and credibility of empirical claims substantially. This refinement is essential before proceeding to full implementation and submission stages, especially given the competitive novelty assessment context where empirical validation quality often distinguishes impactful work from incremental contributions.  This is a MUST-ADDRESS issue for project success and paper acceptance potential at top venues. Target_Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "To substantially boost both novelty and impact, integrate vision-language models into the abductive commonsense prompting paradigm. For example, incorporating visual context or situational imagery as additional input modalities can enrich abductive inference by grounding legal abductive logic in multi-modal evidence, extending applicability to tasks like visual question answering or multimodal reasoning under incomplete info. This could create novel hybrid abductive prompting schemas that synergize language and vision encoding capacities, thereby differentiating the work from existing prompting or abductive reasoning-only approaches. This enhancement leverages the globally linked concept of vision-language models to progress beyond current limitations of purely textual reasoning architectures, potentially unlocking new benchmarks and richer explanations that combine textual and visual abductive justifications. Developing a clear architectural pathway or integration strategy for multi-modal abductive reasoning is recommended here. This strategic recommendation aims to elevate the project’s competitive positioning and real-world relevance in the hot area of multi-modal AI reasoning. Target_Section: Proposed_Method"
