    "title": "Federated Multi-party Privacy-enhancing Bias Mitigation for LLMs in Social Media",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM-based social media moderation systems lack integrated privacy-preserving mechanisms combined with bias mitigation that protect user data while ensuring equitable moderation across demographics.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the external gap around underexplored intersections between social data and privacy protection mechanisms by proposing a federated learning system incorporating advanced privacy-enhancing technologies and bias mitigation strategies.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a federated learning architecture where user data never leaves devices; local models learn personalized bias correction factors based on differential privacy guarantees. Aggregation servers combine locally learned bias mitigation insights without exposing raw data. The system includes adaptive privacy budget allocation sensitive to user trust levels and content sensitivity to balance privacy and utility aggressively.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble a dataset of multilingual social media posts labeled for harmful biases and ethical violations. 2. Implement baseline centralized bias mitigation models and federated counterparts with differential privacy. 3. Measure bias reduction, model accuracy, privacy leakage, and user trust in simulations. 4. Test scalability and robustness on synthetic federated data distributions reflecting real social media user diversity.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A batch of posts with demographic bias issues (e.g., against a minority group) processed locally on user devices. Expected Output: The federated model effectively reduces biased moderation decisions compared to centralized baselines, with quantifiable privacy guarantees and no raw data exposure.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "In case federated learning convergence is suboptimal, switch to hybrid decentralized architectures or apply trusted execution environments for secure model updates. Alternatively, reduce privacy constraints for less sensitive data subsets to improve utility."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a federated learning architecture with local personalized bias correction and adaptive privacy budget allocation. However, the mechanism lacks clarity on how bias mitigation models are personalized locally without risking inconsistencies or fairness drifts across clients. The aggregation procedure to synthesize bias mitigation insights without raw data exposure also needs detailed explanation, especially in balancing utility and privacy. The adaptive privacy budget sensitive to trust levels and content sensitivity is promising but requires formalization and justification, as well as addressing practical trust quantification. Improving the mechanistic exposition with concrete algorithmic design, and clarifying privacy-utility trade-offs, will strengthen soundness and reproducibility substantially. Consider including mathematical formulations or pseudocode of the bias correction and budget adaptation processes to solidify the approach's credibility and enable critical evaluation of its assumptions and guarantees. This is critical since federated bias mitigation combined with differential privacy is nontrivial and the core novelty claim depends on this architecture's rigor and clarity (target: Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_content": "The experiment plan covers assembling datasets, implementing baselines, measuring bias and privacy metrics, and scalability tests on synthetic federated data. However, it misses concrete details on key scientific and technical challenges critical to feasibility. For instance, how will multilingual and labeled social media data be collected or annotated respecting privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA? How will user trust be quantitatively measured in simulations? The plan also lacks strategies to handle imbalanced demographic and linguistic groups commonly present in social media, which impact bias mitigation and federated learning convergence. Synthetic data testing is helpful but should be supplemented with at least one real federated deployment scenario or user study framework to demonstrate practical viability. Furthermore, the fallback mechanisms are briefly mentioned but not integrated systematically into experimental contingencies. Strengthening the experiment design with clearer dataset sourcing, robust metrics definition, comprehensive baselines reflecting state-of-the-art federated bias mitigation systems, and explicit validation on heterogeneous, realistic data distributions will improve feasibility and credibility (target: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the competitive novelty level, enhancing impact and differentiation through integration with globally-linked concepts could be beneficial. Specifically, leveraging regulatory frameworks like GDPR and California Consumer Privacy Act could contextualize adaptive privacy budget allocation and federated learning privacy guarantees, rendering the system more compliant and practically relevant. Moreover, incorporating NLP techniques such as offensive language detection and language identification could improve bias mitigation granularity across multilingual social media platforms. Integrating cognitive load theory or adaptive learning system concepts might inspire novel user trust evaluation or personalization mechanisms, increasing user-centric fairness. Exploring connections to AI techniques in platform integration and risk mitigation of unauthorized access can contextualize security considerations holistically. Such multidisciplinary infusion can boost both the novelty and impact while addressing real-world constraints and user trust, setting the work apart in a competitive space (target: Motivation/Proposed_Method)."
