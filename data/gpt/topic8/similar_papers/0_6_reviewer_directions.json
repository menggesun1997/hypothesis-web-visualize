    "title": "Multimodal Knowledge Graph Convolution for Open-Domain Explanation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing XAI methods for LLMs are primarily unimodal, failing to leverage visual commonsense knowledge to improve semantic encoding and explanations in open-domain QA.",
    "Motivation": "There is a hidden bridge opportunity to integrate CNN-extracted visual knowledge with commonsense KGs via graph convolution for richer semantic understanding and explanation generation, directly addressing external multimodal gaps.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct multimodal knowledge graphs combining visual entity features extracted via CNNs and semantic nodes from commonsense KGs. Use graph convolutional networks to propagate information across modalities and conditions the LLM's response and explanations on these integrated embeddings to foster grounded, visually informed answers.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Use multimodal QA datasets (e.g. TextVQA), integrate with ConceptNet. Baselines: pure LLM QA, LLM+vision without KG. Evaluate for answer accuracy, explanation multimodality, and user trust with human studies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Image of a kitchen scene, question: 'Why is the oven hot?' The output links visual evidence (oven glowing) with knowledge about ovens heating food and explains accordingly.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If joint multimodal KG is challenging, fall back to separate visual and semantic processing pipelines fused by attention. Alternatively, simplify visual features to detected objects for graph nodes."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method's mechanism, while conceptually appealing, lacks sufficient clarity and specificity on key technical details. For example, it is not clear how the graph convolutional network will effectively fuse visual features extracted by CNNs with semantic nodes from commonsense knowledge graphs, considering their different modalities and representations. Additionally, the approach to conditioning the LLM's response on these integrated embeddings requires elaboration—e.g., how embeddings are incorporated into the LLM pipeline (prompt augmentation, fine-tuning, adapter modules). Concrete architectural details or preliminary formalism would strengthen the soundness and reproducibility of the method. I recommend the authors provide a detailed schematic or algorithm description clarifying the interaction between multi-modal KGs, GCN layers, and LLM conditioning steps to demonstrate the feasibility and plausibility of the approach in practice within the paper body or appendix if space constrained, especially in a competitive research area where incremental novelty requires strong methodological rigor and innovation in integration mechanisms (Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the originality has been pre-assessed as competitive but not outstanding, a promising direction to enhance impact and novelty is to integrate relevant advances in vision-language pre-training and neuro-symbolic AI. Specifically, incorporating vision-language pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP, Flamingo) as the basis for visual feature extraction or joint embedding spaces could provide stronger, more semantically aligned embeddings prior to KG graph convolution. Additionally, neuro-symbolic learning techniques or logic tensor networks could be employed to impose symbolic reasoning constraints atop the multimodal KG embeddings to better enforce commonsense consistency in explanations. This direction would align well with ongoing advances in neuro-symbolic systems in NLP and vision, potentially improving not only the quality of explanations but also robustness and interpretability, thereby broadening the idea’s impact beyond QA into neuro-symbolic AI and knowledge representation communities (referencing Globally-Linked Concepts such as vision-language pre-training, neuro-symbolic AI, neuro-symbolic systems, Logic Tensor Networks, knowledge representation). This would also strategically strengthen the novelty profile in a crowded field."
