    "title": "Hybrid Multimodal-EHR Knowledge Graph for Ethical Decision-Making in Robotic Healthcare Agents",
    "Problem_Statement": "Ethical transparency and expert domain embedding in LLM-driven healthcare virtual agents are insufficiently addressed, impairing trust and safety in patient-robot interactions.",
    "Motivation": "Combines high-potential innovation Opportunity 1 and 2 by constructing hybrid knowledge graphs integrating multimodal clinical data with EHR language samples to provide ethical, expert-informed decision layers augmenting language models in robotic agents.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Extract structured ethical AI constraints and clinical guidelines from multimodal EHR data and clinical narratives to build a dynamic knowledge graph. Fuse this graph with LLM reasoning through a gated attention mechanism that flags ethical conflicts and suggests expert-approved alternatives during interaction, ensuring transparent, ethically-sound recommendations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate multimodal clinical datasets with annotated ethical constraints. 2) Develop pipelines for knowledge graph construction encompassing ethical rules and clinical knowledge. 3) Train LLM-graph fusion models that can detect and explain ethical dilemmas in outputs. 4) Evaluate on both clinical decision accuracy and ethical compliance metrics, supplemented by expert panel reviews.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User asks for a medication adjustment with known allergy risks. Output: System responds, ‘‘Based on your allergy history, this medication is contraindicated. I suggest discussing alternative therapies with your doctor.’’",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If integration fails to detect ethical issues reliably, develop post-hoc ethical validation modules to filter or flag risky outputs. Alternatively, incorporate rule-based AI safety layers before reply generation."

          "feedback_content": "While the high-level description of extracting ethical AI constraints and clinical guidelines from multimodal EHR data to build a dynamic knowledge graph and fusing it with LLMs via gated attention is promising, the proposal lacks clarity on key implementation details such as how multimodal data (images, text, signals) are integrated uniformly into the graph, the specific structure and ontologies used to represent ethical constraints, and how the gated attention mechanism operates to detect versus suggest ethical decisions in real time. You must elaborate the technical feasibility and the internal logic of the proposed fusion mechanism to demonstrate soundness and enable reproducibility or peer validation. Without this, the core mechanism remains too abstract and risks being insufficiently grounded for the community to adopt or extend. Please provide detailed architecture sketches or algorithmic descriptions addressing these gaps in the Proposed_Method section."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines sensible stages but could underestimate the complexity and feasibility challenges inherent in curating multimodal clinical datasets with annotated ethical constraints, which is a specialized, labor-intensive task often limited by privacy and annotation costs. Further, training LLM-graph fusion models that can reliably detect and explain ethical dilemmas is a very ambitious goal given current shortcomings in defining, measuring, and operationalizing 'ethical compliance' metrics. The plan also lacks contingencies for noisy, incomplete, or biased EHR data that often complicate knowledge graph construction and subsequent modeling. Please revise the Experiment_Plan with clearer feasibility assessments, timelines, resource needs, and strategies for overcoming data scarcity or annotation bottlenecks, such as synthetic data generation, transfer learning from related domains or incremental module evaluation before end-to-end fusion."
