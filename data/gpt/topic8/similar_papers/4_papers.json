    "abstract": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have raised concerns about the ethical, moral, and legal safeguards. There is a pressing need to improve metrics for assessing security and privacy of AI systems and to manage AI technology in a more ethical manner. To address these challenges, an AI Trust Framework and Maturity Model is proposed to enhance trust in the design and management of AI systems. Trust in AI involves an agreed-upon understanding between humans and machines about system performance. The framework utilizes an \"entropy lens\" to root the study in information theory and enhance transparency and trust in \"black box\" AI systems, which lack ethical guardrails. High entropy in AI systems can decrease human trust, particularly in uncertain and competitive environments. The research draws inspiration from entropy studies to improve trust and performance in autonomous human-machine teams and systems, including interconnected elements in hierarchical systems. Applying this lens to improve trust in AI also highlights new opportunities to optimize performance in teams. Two use cases are described to validate the AI framework's ability to measure trust in the design and management of AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming various aspects of our daily lives and work through their generated content, known as Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). To effectively harness this change, it is essential to understand the limitations within these models. While extensive prior research has addressed biases in OpenAI’s ChatGPT, limited attention has been given to biases present in Chinese Large Language Models (C-LLMs). This study systematically examines biases in five representative C-LLMs. We collected 90 Chinese surnames derived from authoritative demographic statistics and 12 occupations covering various professional sectors as input prompts. Each prompt was generated three times by the C-LLMs, resulting in a dataset comprising 16,200 generated personal profiles. We then evaluated these profiles for biases regarding gender, region, age, and educational background. Our findings reveal that the content produced by each examined C-LLMs exhibits significant gender and regional biases, as well as age and educational stereotypes. Notably, while most models can generate some unbiased content, ChatGLM stands out as the exception. In contrast, Tongyiqianwen is the only model that may refuse to generate certain content, due to its strong privacy protection mechanisms. We also further analyze the underlying mechanisms of bias formation by examining different stages of the model lifecycle and considering the unique characteristics of the Chinese linguistic and sociocultural context. This paper will contribute substantially to the literature on biases in C-LLMs and provide important insights for users aiming to utilize these models more effectively and ethically.",

    "abstract": "This review explores the role of prompt engineering in unleashing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Prompt engineering is the process of structuring inputs, and it has emerged as a crucial technique for maximizing the utility and accuracy of these models. Both foundational and advanced prompt engineering methodologies-including techniques such as self-consistency, chain of thought, and generated knowledge, which can significantly enhance the performance of models-are explored in this paper. Additionally, the prompt methods for vision language models (VLMs) are examined in detail. Prompt methods are evaluated with subjective and objective metrics, ensuring a robust analysis of their efficacy. Critical to this discussion is the role of prompt engineering in artificial intelligence (AI) security, particularly in terms of defending against adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs. Strategies for minimizing these risks and improving the robustness of models are thoroughly reviewed. Finally, we provide a perspective for future research and applications.",

    "abstract": "Collective intelligence underpins the success of groups, organizations, markets and societies. Through distributed cognition and coordination, collectives can achieve outcomes that exceed the capabilities of individuals—even experts—resulting in improved accuracy and novel capabilities. Often, collective intelligence is supported by information technology, such as online prediction markets that elicit the ‘wisdom of crowds’, online forums that structure collective deliberation or digital platforms that crowdsource knowledge from the public. Large language models, however, are transforming how information is aggregated, accessed and transmitted online. Here we focus on the unique opportunities and challenges this transformation poses for collective intelligence. We bring together interdisciplinary perspectives from industry and academia to identify potential benefits, risks, policy-relevant considerations and open research questions, culminating in a call for a closer examination of how large language models affect humans’ ability to collectively tackle complex problems.",

    "abstract": "Social data in digital form-including user-generated content, expressed or implicit relations between people, and behavioral traces-are at the core of popular applications and platforms, driving the research agenda of many researchers. The promises of social data are many, including understanding \"what the world thinks\" about a social issue, brand, celebrity, or other entity, as well as enabling better decision-making in a variety of fields including public policy, healthcare, and economics. Many academics and practitioners have warned against the naïve usage of social data. There are biases and inaccuracies occurring at the source of the data, but also introduced during processing. There are methodological limitations and pitfalls, as well as ethical boundaries and unexpected consequences that are often overlooked. This paper recognizes the rigor with which these issues are addressed by different researchers varies across a wide range. We identify a variety of menaces in the practices around social data use, and organize them in a framework that helps to identify them. \"<i>For your own sanity, you have to remember that not all problems can be solved. Not all problems can be solved, but all problems can be illuminated.\" -Ursula Franklin</i>.",

    "abstract": "The 22nd International Congress of Nutrition (ICN) was organized under the auspices of the International Union of Nutritional Sciences (IUNS) and was celebrated Japan, December 6-11, 2022. The IUNS-ICN is a four-yearly meeting that has been held since 1946. The 2022 IUNS- ICN edition has been conjointly organized by the Japan society of Nutrition and Food Science, The Japanese Society of Nutrition and Dietetics and the IUNS Council with the integrative collaboration of the Organizing, Scientific and Executive Committees under the motto \"The Power of Nutrition: for the smiles of 10 billion people\". The aim of this IUNS 22nd ICN was to promote the global exchange of knowledge in Nutritional Sciences and to encourage communications well as capacity building. The scientific program comprised 2 Opening Lectures, 8 Plenary Lectures, 32 Special Lectures, 8 Special Symposia, 124 Symposia and 2 Panel Discussions and 1 Closing Lecture. The congress focused on every aspect of nutrition issues, going through a wide variety of topics, which were dealt with from different perspectives in order to enrich our attendees' points of view. Let us mention the tracks of the developed program: Advances in Nutrition Research, Nutrients and Nutritional Assessment, Nutrition Through Life Course, Nutrition and Management of Diseases, Food Culture Practices and Nutrition Education, Public Health Nutrition and Environment, Functional Foods and Bioactive Compounds, Agriculture, Food Science and Safety, Additional Global Nutritional The main goal was to offer a high-level scientific meeting focused on addressing the key aspects of nutrition in a multicultural environment, from state-of-the-art reviews to cutting edge nutritional science information. Sessions are planned to deliver latest investigations and outcomes concerning the impact of nutrition on homeostasis and body metabolism, on dietary intake and nutritional status of the population and the individual for precision nutrition as well on the role of dietary prescriptions in disease management and prevention. Translational research orientated to design and implement strategies and approaches to change dietary behaviors and to develop policies, as well as aspects related to public health issues, Nutrition Education and Climate Change, or Food and Agriculture for Health Maintenance, were included in the program. Eight plenary sessions framed the program with eminent speakers covering all health aspects in the life cycle with integrative views on food security. The present supplement accounts for 1798 abstracts from 97 countries, including the summaries of more than 500 selected guest speakers participating in the scientific symposia.",

    "year": 2024,

    "abstract": "This study addresses ethical issues surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs)\nwithin the field of artificial intelligence. It explores the common ethical\nchallenges posed by both LLMs and other AI systems, such as privacy and\nfairness, as well as ethical challenges uniquely arising from LLMs. It\nhighlights challenges such as hallucination, verifiable accountability, and\ndecoding censorship complexity, which are unique to LLMs and distinct from\nthose encountered in traditional AI systems. The study underscores the need to\ntackle these complexities to ensure accountability, reduce biases, and enhance\ntransparency in the influential role that LLMs play in shaping information\ndissemination. It proposes mitigation strategies and future directions for LLM\nethics, advocating for interdisciplinary collaboration. It recommends ethical\nframeworks tailored to specific domains and dynamic auditing systems adapted to\ndiverse contexts. This roadmap aims to guide responsible development and\nintegration of LLMs, envisioning a future where ethical considerations govern\nAI advancements in society.",
