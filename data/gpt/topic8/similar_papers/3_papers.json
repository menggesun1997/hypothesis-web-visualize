    "abstract": "The goal of few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) is to learn new concepts from a limited number of novel samples while preserving the knowledge of previously learned classes. The mainstream FSCIL framework begins with training in the base session, after which the feature extractor is frozen to accommodate novel classes. We observed that traditional base-session training approaches often lead to overfitting on challenging samples, which can lead to reduced robustness in the decision boundaries and exacerbate the forgetting phenomenon when introducing incremental data. To address this issue, we proposed the progressive learning strategy (PGLS). First, inspired by curriculum learning, we developed a covariance noise perturbation approach based on the statistical information as a difficulty measure for assessing sample robustness. We then reweighted the samples based on their robustness, initially concentrating on enhancing model stability by prioritizing robust samples and subsequently leveraging weakly robust samples to improve generalization. Second, we predefined forward compatibility for various virtual class augmentation models. Within base class training, we employed a curriculum learning strategy that progressively introduced fewer to more virtual classes in order to mitigate any adverse effects on model performance. This strategy enhances the adaptability of base classes to novel ones and alleviates forgetting problems. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the CUB200, CIFAR100, and miniImageNet datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed method over state-of-the-art models.",

    "abstract": "As the parameter size of large language models (LLMs) continues to expand, there is an urgent need to address the scarcity of high-quality data. In response, existing research has attempted to make a breakthrough by incorporating federated learning (FL) into LLMs. Conversely, considering the outstanding performance of LLMs in task generalization, researchers have also tried applying LLMs within FL to tackle challenges in relevant domains. The complementarity between LLMs and FL has already ignited widespread research interest. In this review, we aim to deeply explore the integration of LLMs and FL. We propose a research framework dividing the fusion of LLMs and FL into three parts: the combination of LLM sub-technologies with FL, the integration of FL sub-technologies with LLMs, and the overall merger of LLMs and FL. We first provide a comprehensive review of the current state of research in the domain of LLMs combined with FL, including their typical applications, integration advantages, challenges faced, and future directions for resolution. Subsequently, we discuss the practical applications of the combination of LLMs and FL in critical scenarios such as healthcare, finance, and education and provide new perspectives and insights into future research directions for LLMs and FL.",
