    "title": "Dynamic Explanation Framework Combining Legal Abductive Logic and LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs have limited capacity to reason abductively with incomplete information and provide evolving explanations in open-domain QA.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by cross-domain transfer of legal abductive logic frameworks, this approach develops a dynamic explanation system augmenting LLMs with abductive logic modules to handle incomplete knowledge and produce legal-style argumentation explanations, filling key internal gaps.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement a pipeline where LLM answers are post-processed by an abductive reasoning engine modeled after legal argument frameworks. This engine generates abductive hypotheses and constructs reasoning chains as explanations. The system dynamically updates explanations in response to user feedback or new evidence, enabling iterative refinement.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Use QA datasets with incomplete context. Baselines are LLM explanations without abductive refinement. Measure improved answer robustness, explanation plausibility, and adaptive explanation quality with human evaluators.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Question: 'Was the defendant negligent?' The system provides an answer supported by abductive assumptions and argument chains modeled on legal standards.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If hybrid systems prove cumbersome, integrate abductive logic rules directly into LLM prompt templates or fine-tune LLMs on abductive reasoning tasks using synthetic legal reasoning corpora."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a high-level pipeline combining LLMs with a legal abductive reasoning engine, but the mechanism for integrating the two components lacks specificity. For example, it is unclear how abductive hypotheses are generated and selected, how the abductive reasoning engine interfaces with LLM outputs, or how contradictory abductive explanations are resolved. Clarifying the internal workings, data flow, and interaction protocols within the hybrid system is essential to validate feasibility and soundness. Providing technical details on the logic formalism used, hypothesis ranking criteria, and the iterative refinement process would strengthen confidence in the method's soundness and reproducibility, especially given the complexity of legal abductive logic integration with LLMs. This would also help reduce ambiguity regarding dynamic explanation updates based on user feedback or new evidence. Consider a detailed architectural diagram and pseudocode or algorithmic description to concretize the mechanism further in the proposal's next iteration, focusing on key decision points and error handling strategies relevant to open-domain QA scenarios with incomplete knowledge contexts.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan proposes evaluation on QA datasets with incomplete context, using human evaluators for explanation plausibility and adaptation. However, the plan lacks concrete details regarding dataset selection, metrics, and evaluation protocols to robustly validate abductive explanation improvements. For instance, which publicly available or domain-specific datasets best approximate incomplete knowledge scenarios relevant to legal abductive reasoning? How will robustness and explanation quality be operationalized quantitatively, beyond human qualitative judgments? What is the scale and process of human evaluation, and how will inter-annotator agreement be ensured? Moreover, the fallback plan mentions fine-tuning on synthetic corpora, yet no experiment plan currently addresses data creation or training validation details. The proposal would benefit from a more concrete, feasible experimental design specifying dataset choices, metrics (e.g., explanation faithfulness, user trust scores), baseline selection rationale, sample sizes, and statistical testing methods. Explicit timelines and computational resource considerations would further enhance feasibility and reproducibility assurances."
