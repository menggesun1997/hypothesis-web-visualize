    "Problem_Statement": "Current healthcare virtual agents do not adapt commonsense knowledge dynamically from real-time interactions, limiting personalization and the effectiveness of human-robot communication.",
    "Motivation": "Directly tackles the gap of isolated language analysis and virtual agent integration by enabling continuous learning from entity recognition in physician-verified dialogues, enhancing personalization and contextual decision-making in clinical HRI.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an adaptive dialogue system that leverages entity recognition and knowledge summarization modules to incrementally update a commonsense knowledge base.

        "title": "Dynamic Multi-Agent Commonsense Learning and Personalization via Dialogue Entity Feedback in Smart Clinical Environments",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing healthcare virtual agents lack a fully integrated, dynamic commonsense learning mechanism from real-time clinical interactions and do not effectively collaborate within multi-agent intelligent healthcare ecosystems. This limits personalization, adaptability, and workflow integration in human-robot clinical interactions.",
        "Motivation": "While current virtual agents in healthcare support isolated dialogue personalization, they mostly rely on static knowledge and simple update mechanisms. Our approach fundamentally advances this by proposing a tightly coupled multi-agent continuous learning framework that incrementally updates a shared commonsense knowledge base driven by physician-validated entity recognition in dialogues. By embedding our agent within a broader intelligent clinical environment—including scheduling assistants and monitoring systems—we enable rich multi-agent collaboration to enhance personalization, decision support, and team workflows. This integrative, human-centered AI design addresses key gaps in dynamic adaptability and multi-agent cooperation, distinguishing our contribution in an increasingly competitive research space.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular multi-agent architecture consisting of: 1) An adaptive Dialogue Entity Recognition (DER) module fine-tuned on longitudinal clinical dialogues to detect and extract entities relevant to patient conditions and care contexts. 2) A Knowledge Summarization and Validation (KSV) module that incrementally updates a shared Commonsense Knowledge Base (CKB) by executing a conflict-aware update protocol, leveraging Bayesian confidence scores to filter noisy inputs and resolve inconsistencies. This module interfaces with human experts who provide reinforcement learning (RL) feedback signals via validation tokens. 3) An RL-driven Dialogue Policy module that optimizes conversational strategies not only based on individual patient-agent interactions but also incorporates context and signals from coexisting clinical AI agents through a negotiation protocol based on multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques. This enables dynamic adaptation aligned with broader clinical team workflows and user interface adaptations in intelligent environments. Data flow: DER outputs candidate new commonsense facts triggering KSV updates; KSV updates modify CKB and send confidence and conflict metrics to the RL module, which adjusts dialogue policies accordingly; multi-agent communication synchronizes state and policies across agents. We provide detailed algorithm pseudocode and system architecture diagrams illustrating these interactions and update mechanisms, emphasizing incremental learning and error handling strategies.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop and fine-tune the Dialogue Entity Recognition module on a large corpus of physician-annotated clinical dialogues focusing on novel symptom and context extraction. 2) Implement the Knowledge Summarization and Validation module employing probabilistic conflict resolution and expert-in-the-loop validation interfaces; conduct simulated evaluations injecting noise and conflicting signals to assess robustness. 3) Integrate a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework enabling our virtual agent to collaborate with simulated scheduling and monitoring agents, learning optimized dialogue and negotiation policies dynamically. 4) Deploy the integrated system in a longitudinal clinical HRI testbed measuring personalization improvements, task success, multi-agent coordination efficacy, expert satisfaction, and system robustness through quantitative metrics and qualitative user studies. 5) Explore extension to interface adaptation within smart clinical environments, assessing agent responsiveness to environmental and user-state changes.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient introduces a previously unrecorded symptom 'intermittent chest pain' during interaction. DER recognizes the entity and estimates high confidence. KSV checks for conflicts within the knowledge base (e.g., conflicting symptoms) and, after expert validation confirms, updates the CKB with the new symptom linked to possible cardiac risk scenarios. The RL dialogue policy module, aware of updated CKB and communications from scheduling agents (indicating cardiologist availability), adapts the dialogue: \"Noted your new symptom of intermittent chest pain. Shall I coordinate with your cardiologist to schedule an appointment?\" Concurrently, a monitoring agent flags vital signs suggesting urgency, influencing dialogue urgency cues. This multi-agent collaboration and continuous learning dynamically personalize and contextualize patient care conversation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time incremental updates lead to performance degradation or instability, revert to a hybrid update model combining: periodic batch retraining of the knowledge base with aggregated expert annotations, followed by phased redeployment. Maintain expert-in-the-loop validation for RL feedback to ensure correctness. Alternatively, isolate updates within simulation environments prior to real deployment and implement threshold-based gating mechanisms restricting updates that fall below confidence criteria. Incorporate fallback communication with co-agent modules to ensure multi-agent collaboration continuity even when individual agent learning is temporarily suspended."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposal outlines a high-level framework involving entity recognition, knowledge summarization, and reinforcement learning for continuous commonsense learning, the exact mechanism how these components interact dynamically remains under-specified. For example, it is unclear how the system decides which recognized entities translate into commonsense knowledge updates, how conflicts or noisy signals are resolved, and how reinforcement learning feedback is precisely integrated with knowledge base updates. Clarifying the data flow, update triggers, and algorithmic details with respect to incremental learning and handling errors would strengthen confidence in the method's soundness and operational clarity. Consider providing concrete algorithm pseudocode or system architecture diagrams to elucidate these mechanisms in the 'Proposed_Method'. This will help reviewers understand feasibility and innovativeness in a competitive area where detailed implementation strategies matter significantly for impact and novelty assessment."

          "feedback_content": "Given the 'novelty' evaluation as only NOV-COMPETITIVE and the globally-linked concepts around human-centered AI, socially interactive agents, and multi-agent systems, the proposal could enhance its impact and distinctiveness by exploring integration of the adaptive commonsense dialogue system within multi-agent clinical environments. For example, enabling the virtual agent to collaborate or negotiate with other AI agents (e.g., scheduling assistants, monitoring agents) or to personalize not only the physician-patient dialogue but also support team workflows could broaden applicability. Additionally, leveraging approaches from intelligent environments and user interface adaptation could ground the system within broader smart healthcare contexts, increasing relevance and interdisciplinary impact. Expanding the scope in this manner may better position the work in top conferences where cross-domain, human-centered AI advances are highly valued."
