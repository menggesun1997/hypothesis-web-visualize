    "title": "Doctor-Labeled Summarization-Guided Trustworthy Dialogue Agents",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing AI virtual agents in healthcare lack interpretability and trustworthiness due to insufficient integration of expert-labeled summaries and reasoning over patient language samples.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap identified in the hidden bridge by combining physician-labeled EHR summarization with foundation model multimodal reasoning, thus directly advancing the AI Trust Framework and ethical safeguards in HRI systems.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a multi-stage pipeline that first uses expert-labeled physician summaries of patient dialogues to train specialized summarization models. Then, combine these summaries with multimodal inputs (e.g., patient speech, vitals) into a transformer-based reasoning framework that outputs interpretable recommendations with uncertainty quantification and provenance tracing.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect and preprocess physician-labeled dialogue summarization datasets. 2) Train an abstractive summarization model aligned with expert summaries. 3) Integrate multimodal patient data with summary embeddings via multi-head attention layers. 4) Fine-tune a reasoning head for decision support tasks. 5) Benchmark interpretability using explainable AI metrics and run clinical expert assessments for trustworthiness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Dialogue transcript including patient symptoms and doctor notes. Output: Summarized health status with reasoning trace, e.g., ‘‘Summary: Patient experiences high blood pressure and headache. Recommended action: Schedule urgent cardiology consult. Reasoning: Elevated vitals coupled with clinical history indicate risk.’’",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If physician-labeled summaries are sparse, utilize semi-supervised or self-training approaches bootstrapping from large unlabeled corpora. Alternatively, implement interpretable surrogate models to approximate decision reasoning."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan proposes collecting physician-labeled dialogue summarization datasets as the first step, which may be challenging due to the scarcity and privacy constraints of such specialized clinical data. The plan should address data acquisition logistics more concretely, including securing clinical partnerships, ethical review processes, and fallback strategies if labeled data is insufficient. Additionally, the integration of multimodal patient data (speech, vitals) and reasoning over summaries is technically ambitious; the plan would benefit from early pilot studies or modular ablation experiments to isolate components and ensure feasibility before end-to-end fine-tuning. Clarify evaluation metrics beyond explainable AI criteria, such as clinical validity or healthcare outcomes, to strengthen feasibility and rigor of the experimental approach in a realistic clinical setting. In summary, a more detailed, phased, and pragmatic experimental roadmap is needed to ensure scientific soundness and practical viability of this complex system pipeline, especially considering clinical constraints and interpretability requirements, which are non-trivial in healthcare AI deployments. This will improve confidence that the project can be executed successfully and yield trustworthy results at scale in real-world healthcare environments, addressing critical feasibility concerns upfront rather than late-stage risks and pivots.  Suggestions include simulation environments, synthetic data augmentation, and staged validation three-tiered from technical to clinical expert review steps with clear go/no-go criteria defined at each phase for resource-efficient progress tracking and risk mitigation.  This refinement will substantially elevate the robustness and implementability of the proposed research plan, directly addressing the specialized challenges posed by sensitive clinical multimodal data and human expert label scarcity/secrecy constraints in the medical domain.  Failing to do so risks the entire approach stalling or yielding results that lack robustness or transferability beyond controlled research settings, undermining the goal of trustworthy healthcare AI agents and ethical safeguards in HRI systems outlined as the key motivation and impact aspiration of the project.  Therefore, iteration on the experiment plan should be prioritized as an essential next step before major resource investments or extended development cycles commence, securing both soundness and feasibility pillars critical for downstream impact realization in high-stakes medical AI applications such as summarization-guided trustworthy dialogue agents in patient care and clinical decision support contexts referenced in the proposal title, problem statement, and example outputs sections.  Overall, tightening and concretizing the experimental plan addressing these points will markedly reduce execution risks and improve the proposal's potential for acceptance and eventual real-world efficacy and deployment impact targeting patient safety and biomedical informatics domains under the broader umbrella of generative AI and pretrained language model applications in healthcare contexts with explicit trust and interpretability mechanisms embedded, as envisioned by the authors' motivating rationale and method design currently outlined in broad strokes at the proposal stage but requiring operational and validation detail enhancement to fully convince reviewers of practical feasibility and soundness upfront, beyond mere novelty classification as NOV-COMPETITIVE indicating strong existing competition needing exemplary execution quality and rigor to succeed and stand out in such a saturated research landscape focused on trustworthy AI in medicine and clinical decision-making settings, meriting thorough internal reassessment and precision planning refinement as critical foundational groundwork to justify future investment and resource allocation for this promising yet complex initiative.  This comprehensive and carefully staged validation pipeline upgrading will also aid downstream impact realization, acceptance by clinical end-users, and eventual integration within regulatory frameworks needed for AI agents operating in sensitive healthcare interactions requiring trustworthy, interpretable, and ethically sound systems aligned with advanced AI trust frameworks and human-robot interaction safeguards highlighted in the stated motivation and problem framing, requiring explicit emphasis and elaboration now in the experimental plan section to substantiate feasibility and soundness claims underpinning high-impact potential cited throughout the entire proposal documentation in its current form, thereby increasing credibility, fundability, and ultimately

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the focus on physician-labeled summarization for trustworthy healthcare dialogue agents, a concrete way to enhance both impact and novelty is to explicitly integrate patient safety frameworks, biomedical informatics standards, and recent advances in generative AI with pretrained language models. This can be achieved by grounding the multi-stage pipeline not only in clinical expert summaries but also incorporating standardized electronic health record (EHR) interoperability formats and patient safety incident reporting protocols to ensure outputs align with regulatory compliance and clinical workflows. Embedding ontologies and structured knowledge from biomedical informatics within the transformer reasoning module can improve reasoning fidelity, enhancing interpretability and actionable recommendations. Additionally, leveraging domain adaptation techniques to tailor pretrained language models on biomedical corpora and patient safety event datasets can increase robustness and reliability, reducing hallucination risks common in generative models. Such cross-disciplinary integration will distinguish the work from related existing efforts and strengthen its position at the forefront of trustworthy AI agents in healthcare, directly advancing the AI Trust Framework and ethical safeguards in human-robot interaction systems as the proposal envisions. This approach also opens avenues for higher impact by facilitating clinical adoption, improving patient outcomes, and fostering safer human-AI collaborative decision making in medical settings. Therefore, the authors should augment the current proposal to systematically incorporate these biomedical informatics and patient safety linked concepts and related methodological innovations into their model architecture, data pipeline, evaluation metrics, and deployment scenarios, thus concretely leveraging the globally linked concepts provided to elevate their research contribution in this highly competitive landscape."
