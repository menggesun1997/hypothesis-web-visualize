    "title": "Cross-Modal Graph Convolutional Commonsense Integration",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is an underexplored opportunity to link convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with commonsense knowledge and XAI in multimodal semantic understanding for open-domain QA, especially in scenarios requiring visual context.",
    "Motivation": "Filling the external gap that global co-occurrence analyses revealed, this approach unifies graphical commonsense reasoning with visual feature extraction to enhance LLMs' semantic knowledge encoding for multimodal question answering and explanations.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a novel graph convolutional network that fuses visual features extracted by CNNs from images or videos with nodes representing commonsense knowledge from knowledge graphs. The fused graph embeddings inform a large language model conditioned on both text and visual context. This multimodal semantic grounding improves reasoning fidelity and produces explanations referencing visual and conceptual evidence.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Datasets: Visual QA datasets (e.g., VQA v2) combined with commonsense KG datasets. Baselines: LLMs with vision-language models without explicit graph fusion. Evaluate accuracy, explanation relevance, and multi-modal grounding. Use graph attention mechanisms to test interpretability and ablation on graph components.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Image showing a cat drinking water, question: \"Why is the cat drinking water now?\" Expected answer: 'Because the cat is thirsty.' Explanation references visual cues ('cat's tongue lapping') and commonsense nodes about animal thirst behavior.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct GCN fusion limits scalability, switch to modular late fusion combining separate visual and commonsense embeddings via cross-attention. Alternatively, simplify graph structures to domain-specific subgraphs to reduce complexity."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that a graph convolutional network (GCN) can effectively fuse visual CNN features with commonsense knowledge graph nodes to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning is plausible but lacks clarity in handling the inherent modality heterogeneity. Specifically, the proposal should address how the semantic alignment between visual features (often high-dimensional and spatially structured) and symbolic knowledge graph embeddings is achieved and validated. Without a clear mapping or embedding harmonization strategy, the usefulness of the fused graph embeddings for multimodal reasoning remains speculative. Furthermore, assumptions about improved explainability via graph attention mechanisms need preliminary justification or references to prior work demonstrating interpretability gains in such multimodal fusion contexts. Clarifying these assumptions will strengthen soundness and theoretical grounding of the method. This should be elaborated primarily in the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections to solidify the foundational premises of the approach and establish transparent expectations for reasoning fidelity and explanation quality in the fused system environment, especially given the competitive landscape noted in the novelty screening."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is logically structured but can be improved to better assess feasibility and practical impact. Currently, the plan mainly focuses on accuracy, explanation relevance, and ablation studies with graph attention. However, to rigorously demonstrate the multimodal fusion benefits and scalability, the experiments should explicitly include detailed evaluations of computational overhead, training stability, and handling of real-world noisy or out-of-distribution visual contexts. Additionally, since the fallback involves modular late fusion or domain-specific subgraphs, experiments should also benchmark these alternatives to empirically inform trade-offs between model complexity and performance. Finally, the plan would benefit from incorporating zero-shot or few-shot generalization scenarios to align with the proposal’s multimodal semantic grounding claims and ensure the approach's robustness and adaptability. Enhancing the experiment plan to cover these dimensions will substantiate the method’s practical feasibility, especially in open-domain QA tasks involving commonsense and visual context fusion."
