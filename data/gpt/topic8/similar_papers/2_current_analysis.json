Your mission is to analyze a curated set of research papers and their underlying conceptual structure to produce a comprehensive 'Landscape Map' that reveals the current state, critical gaps, and novel opportunities in the field of **Analyzing the Impact of Retrieval-Augmented Generation on LLMs’ Acquisition of Up-to-Date World Knowledge**.\n\n### Part A: Foundational Literature\nHere are the core similar research papers, which includes the paperId, title and abstract.\n```text\n[{'paper_id': 1, 'title': 'Large Language Models in Neurosurgery', 'abstract': 'A large language model (LLM), in the context of natural language processing and artificial intelligence, refers to a sophisticated neural network that has been trained on a massive amount of text data to understand and generate human-like language. These models are typically built on architectures like transformers. The term “large” indicates that the neural network has a significant number of parameters, making it more powerful and capable of capturing complex patterns in language. One notable example of a large language model is ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like text. It can be trained on a variety of tasks, such as language translation, question answering, and text completion. One of the key features of ChatGPT is its ability to understand and respond to natural language inputs. This makes it a powerful tool for generating a wide range of text, including medical reports, surgical notes, and even poetry. Additionally, the model has been trained on a large corpus of text, which allows it to generate text that is both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. In terms of applications in neurosurgery, ChatGPT can be used to generate detailed and accurate surgical reports, which can be very useful for sharing information about a patient’s case with other members of the medical team. Additionally, the model can be used to generate detailed surgical notes, which can be very useful for training and educating residents and medical students. Overall, LLMs have the potential to be a valuable tool in the field of neurosurgery. Indeed, this abstract has been generated by ChatGPT within few seconds. Potential applications and pitfalls of the applications of LLMs are discussed in this paper.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Foundation models and intelligent decision-making: Progress, challenges, and perspectives', 'abstract': \"Intelligent decision-making (IDM) is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to automate or augment decision processes. Modern IDM paradigms integrate advanced frameworks to enable intelligent agents to make effective and adaptive choices and decompose complex tasks into manageable steps, such as AI agents and high-level reinforcement learning. Recent advances in multimodal foundation-based approaches unify diverse input modalities-such as vision, language, and sensory data-into a cohesive decision-making process. Foundation models (FMs) have become pivotal in science and industry, transforming decision-making and research capabilities. Their large-scale, multimodal data-processing abilities foster adaptability and interdisciplinary breakthroughs across fields such as healthcare, life sciences, and education. This survey examines IDM's evolution, advanced paradigms with FMs and their transformative impact on decision-making across diverse scientific and industrial domains, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in building efficient, adaptive, and ethical decision systems.\"}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Unleashing the potential of prompt engineering for large language models', 'abstract': 'This review explores the role of prompt engineering in unleashing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Prompt engineering is the process of structuring inputs, and it has emerged as a crucial technique for maximizing the utility and accuracy of these models. Both foundational and advanced prompt engineering methodologies-including techniques such as self-consistency, chain of thought, and generated knowledge, which can significantly enhance the performance of models-are explored in this paper. Additionally, the prompt methods for vision language models (VLMs) are examined in detail. Prompt methods are evaluated with subjective and objective metrics, ensuring a robust analysis of their efficacy. Critical to this discussion is the role of prompt engineering in artificial intelligence (AI) security, particularly in terms of defending against adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs. Strategies for minimizing these risks and improving the robustness of models are thoroughly reviewed. Finally, we provide a perspective for future research and applications.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Empowering biomedical discovery with AI agents', 'abstract': 'We envision \"AI scientists\" as systems capable of skeptical learning and reasoning that empower biomedical research through collaborative agents that integrate AI models and biomedical tools with experimental platforms. Rather than taking humans out of the discovery process, biomedical AI agents combine human creativity and expertise with AI\\'s ability to analyze large datasets, navigate hypothesis spaces, and execute repetitive tasks. AI agents are poised to be proficient in various tasks, planning discovery workflows and performing self-assessment to identify and mitigate gaps in their knowledge. These agents use large language models and generative models to feature structured memory for continual learning and use machine learning tools to incorporate scientific knowledge, biological principles, and theories. AI agents can impact areas ranging from virtual cell simulation, programmable control of phenotypes, and the design of cellular circuits to developing new therapies.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Prospective Role of Foundation Models in Advancing Autonomous Vehicles', 'abstract': \"With the development of artificial intelligence and breakthroughs in deep learning, large-scale foundation models (FMs), such as generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), Sora, etc., have achieved remarkable results in many fields including natural language processing and computer vision. The application of FMs in autonomous driving holds considerable promise. For example, they can contribute to enhancing scene understanding and reasoning. By pre-training on rich linguistic and visual data, FMs can understand and interpret various elements in a driving scene, and provide cognitive reasoning to give linguistic and action instructions for driving decisions and planning. Furthermore, FMs can augment data based on the understanding of driving scenarios to provide feasible scenes of those rare occurrences in the long tail distribution that are unlikely to be encountered during routine driving and data collection. The enhancement can subsequently lead to improvement in the accuracy and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Another testament to the potential of FMs' applications lies in world models, exemplified by the DREAMER series, which showcases the ability to comprehend physical laws and dynamics. Learning from massive data under the paradigm of self-supervised learning, world models can generate unseen yet plausible driving environments, facilitating the enhancement in the prediction of road users' behaviors and the off-line training of driving strategies. In this paper, we synthesize the applications and future trends of FMs in autonomous driving. By utilizing the powerful capabilities of FMs, we strive to tackle the potential issues stemming from the long-tail distribution in autonomous driving, consequently advancing overall safety in this domain.\"}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Simulating expert clinical comprehension: Adapting latent semantic analysis to accurately extract clinical concepts from psychiatric narrative', 'abstract': 'Cognitive studies reveal that less-than-expert clinicians are less able to recognize meaningful patterns of data in clinical narratives. Accordingly, psychiatric residents early in training fail to attend to information that is relevant to diagnosis and the assessment of dangerousness. This manuscript presents cognitively motivated methodology for the simulation of expert ability to organize relevant findings supporting intermediate diagnostic hypotheses. Latent Semantic Analysis is used to generate a semantic space from which meaningful associations between psychiatric terms are derived. Diagnostically meaningful clusters are modeled as geometric structures within this space and compared to elements of psychiatric narrative text using semantic distance measures. A learning algorithm is defined that alters components of these geometric structures in response to labeled training data. Extraction and classification of relevant text segments is evaluated against expert annotation, with system-rater agreement approximating rater-rater agreement. A range of biomedical informatics applications for these methods are suggested.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Crossmodal lifelong learning in hybrid neural embodied architectures', 'abstract': 'Lake et al. point out that grounding learning in general principles of embodied perception and social cognition is the next step in advancing artificial intelligent machines. We suggest it is necessary to go further and consider lifelong learning, which includes developmental learning, focused on embodiment as applied in developmental robotics and neurorobotics, and crossmodal learning that facilitates integrating multiple senses.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Theories or fragments?', 'abstract': 'Lake et al. argue persuasively that modelling human-like intelligence requires flexible, compositional representations in order to embody world knowledge. But human knowledge is too sparse and self-contradictory to be embedded in \"intuitive theories.\" We argue, instead, that knowledge is grounded in exemplar-based learning and generalization, combined with high flexible generalization, a viewpoint compatible both with non-parametric Bayesian modelling and with sub-symbolic methods such as neural networks.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Avoiding frostbite: It helps to learn from others', 'abstract': 'Machines that learn and think like people must be able to learn from others. Social learning speeds up the learning process and\\xa0-\\xa0in combination with language\\xa0-\\xa0is a gateway to abstract and unobservable information. Social learning also facilitates the accumulation of knowledge across generations, helping people and artificial intelligences learn things that no individual could learn in a lifetime.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.
