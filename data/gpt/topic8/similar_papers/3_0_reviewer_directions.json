    "title": "Adaptive Knowledge Distillation with Semantic Replay for Continual LLM Updating",
    "Problem_Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) face catastrophic forgetting when continually learning new world knowledge from limited data streams, especially under few-shot class-incremental settings. Efficiently retaining old knowledge while incorporating new information remains a core challenge to maintain model utility and robustness.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the internal gap of fragile decision boundaries and exacerbated forgetting identified in the critical gaps section, and leverages hidden bridge external knowledge involving knowledge distillation and data replay. The novelty lies in combining semantic feature replay with adaptive knowledge distillation to boost memory retention in LLMs' continual learning.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a continual learning framework where an LLM trains on new data by distilling knowledge from its previous version while simultaneously replaying semantically rich embeddings of prior concepts. The system dynamically selects replay samples using learned semantic importance scores. Distillation losses are adaptively weighted based on class novelty and sample difficulty, allowing robust boundary formation without overfitting challenging examples. The semantic replay buffer uses compressed embeddings generated by a separate semantic encoder to avoid storing raw data, respecting privacy and scalability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Use standard continual learning NLP benchmarks (e.g., incremental domain adaptation for GPT-2) and few-shot learning datasets such as FewRel. 2) Pretrain baseline LLMs on base classes. 3) Implement the adaptive knowledge distillation with semantic replay method. 4) Compare against progressive learning only, replay-only, and distillation-only baselines. 5) Evaluate on forgetting metrics (average accuracy drop), knowledge retention, and incremental learning efficiency. 6) Ablate replay buffer size and distillation weight strategies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A streamed dataset of new scientific terms with limited annotated examples. Expected output: The updated LLM correctly understands and generates accurate definitions and usage for both prior and newly added terms without performance degradation on old knowledge.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If semantic replay storage is too large or noisy, experiment with learned generative replay models that sample approximate past data representations. Alternatively, simplify distillation weight adaptation using heuristic schedules and inspect boundary robustness with synthetic adversarial samples."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a sophisticated combination of adaptive knowledge distillation and semantic replay using learned semantic importance scores and adaptive weighting strategies. However, the mechanism lacks clarity on critical operational details: how exactly the semantic importance scores are learned and updated during continual learning, how the compressed semantic embeddings preserve sufficient information without compromising downstream distillation quality, and how adaptive distillation weights are quantitatively formulated and optimized. This gap could lead to challenges in reproducibility and might obscure whether the approach can robustly balance old and new knowledge under varying data regimes. I recommend elaborating on these key components with precise algorithmic descriptions and theoretical justification to enhance soundness and clarity of the method's core innovation and practical realization in the Proposed_Method section, including any assumptions about the semantic encoder and the distillation adaptation process that underpin the approach's validity and efficacy in few-shot incremental settings."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment flags this as a competitive area with strong existing links between knowledge distillation, replay, and continual learning, the work would substantially benefit from integrating domain-specific insights or complementary techniques from closely related fields. For example, integrating elements from 'consistency regularization' could help stabilize updated model predictions during adaptation. Alternatively, aligning replay sample selection or weighting strategies with 'neural architecture search' principles might optimize model capacity allocation and improve performance scalability. Leveraging 'federated incremental learning' approaches might also enhance privacy-preserving updates beyond embedding replay. Incorporating such globally linked concepts explicitly into the framework could elevate both impact and novelty. Consider detailing concrete pathways for such integration in the Proposed_Method or Fallback_Plan, and outline experiments evaluating these extensions in the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan for a more competitive and widely applicable contribution."
