    "title": "Expert-Guided Multitask Benchmark for Evaluating Commonsense Integration in Healthcare LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of standardized benchmarks explicitly measuring commonsense knowledge integration and ethical reasoning in medical LLMs for HRI limits research progress and comparison.",
    "Motivation": "Fulfills a major infrastructure gap by providing a unified benchmark derived from expert-annotated dialogues, EHR-derived knowledge graphs, and ethical scenario tests, emphasizing the critical internal and external gaps of knowledge integration and trustworthiness.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multitask benchmark suite combining tasks such as dialogue-based clinical decision support, commonsense inference question answering, ethical compliance classification, and knowledge graph reasoning. Benchmark includes physician-labeled ground truths and scenario-based trust assessment metrics.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect and curate datasets from clinical dialogues, expert annotations, and synthetic ethical dilemmas. 2) Define tasks covering language understanding, knowledge graph reasoning, and ethical safeguards. 3) Create scoring metrics focused on correctness, contextual appropriateness, transparency, and trust. 4) Release benchmark for public evaluation and analyze state-of-the-art LLMs' performance gaps.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Task: Given a patient report with ambiguous symptoms, model must infer plausible commonsense explanations and select ethically sound treatment suggestions matching expert consensus.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If data scarcity arises for some tasks, consider data augmentation using expert-driven simulations or synthetic data creation. Provide modularity to allow incremental task additions later."

        "title": "Expert-Guided Multimodal Multitask Benchmark for Evaluating Commonsense Integration and Trustworthiness in Healthcare LLMs and Robotics",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current benchmarks inadequately measure the integration of commonsense knowledge, ethical reasoning, and multimodal perception in large language models (LLMs) tailored for human-robot interaction (HRI) within healthcare. This gap limits rigorous evaluation of clinical decision support systems and healthcare robots, specifically concerning their trustworthiness, equity, and real-world applicability.",
        "Motivation": "While prior works have introduced benchmarks targeting medical language understanding and ethical compliance, they often lack multimodal and interactive dimensions critical to healthcare robotics. Our benchmark addresses this competitive novelty gap by integrating vision-language modalities, multi-turn HRI dialogues, and health equity considerations. By combining expert-curated and synthetic datasets in an ethically robust framework, the benchmark pushes the frontier for evaluating LLMs and embodied agents in clinical environments, enhancing trust, fairness, and commonsense reasoning in real-world healthcare scenarios.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multitask benchmark suite fusing dialogue-based clinical decision support tasks, vision-language context understanding from healthcare robots' perceptual input (e.g., patient room imagery, object interaction videos), knowledge graph reasoning grounded in electronic health records (EHR), ethical compliance classification, and health equity assessment. The benchmark leverages multi-turn human-robot interaction scenarios to assess contextual awareness, commonsense inference, and fair treatment recommendations. Tasks incorporate physician-validated ground truths, multimodal sensory data, and equity-focused evaluation metrics to uniquely position this suite at the intersection of trustworthy AI, domain-specific knowledge, and multimodal robotics in healthcare.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Collection and Curation: Source de-identified clinical dialogues with informed patient consent ensuring privacy compliance; partner with hospitals for diverse datasets representing varied demographics and clinical settings. Concurrently, capture multimodal data (images/videos) from healthcare robot environments, ensuring IRB approvals. Develop synthetic ethical dilemma scenarios through expert panels, validated via pilot studies with clinicians.\n\n2) Task Definition: Define integrated tasks spanning text-only clinical dialogues, vision-language understanding (e.g., scene interpretation, object recognition pertinent to patient care), commonsense question answering, ethical reasoning classification, and health equity impact evaluation.\n\n3) Metric Development: Establish multi-dimensional scoring encompassing accuracy, contextual appropriateness, transparency of reasoning, fairness across demographic subgroups, and trustworthiness scores.\n\n4) Validation and Benchmark Release: Pilot benchmark on diverse state-of-the-art LLMs and embodied healthcare robots; analyze performance gaps with statistical rigor. Release benchmark publicly with data governance documentation.\n\n5) Milestones and Timeline: \n- Months 1-4: Data acquisition, privacy protocols, and IRB approval.\n- Months 5-7: Synthetic scenario creation and expert validation.\n- Months 8-10: Task and metric formalization.\n- Months 11-13: Pilot benchmarking and analysis.\n- Month 14: Public release and dissemination.\n\nResource allocations include clinical collaborators, data engineers, and legal advisors specializing in healthcare ethics and privacy.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "- Given a multi-turn dialogue between a healthcare robot and a patient presenting ambiguous symptoms, the model must integrate visual observations of the patient's environment and infer plausible commonsense explanations, propose equitable and ethically sound treatment options aligned with physician consensus.\n- In a scene with a patient room image and clinical notes, the system should detect potential safety concerns (e.g., fall hazards), reason about patient-specific health conditions, and generate contextually appropriate alerts.\n- Classify clinical decisions for bias across demographic subgroups, testing the model's fairness and health equity adherence.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If access to comprehensive multimodal clinical data is limited, we will expand expert-driven data augmentation with high-fidelity synthetic vision-language simulations and generate multi-turn dialogue datasets simulating diverse patient contexts. Modular task frameworks ensure individual task validation prior to full integration, allowing incremental benchmark development while maintaining ethical safeguards and scientific rigor."

To enhance feasibility, the plan should clearly specify how data privacy, consent, and clinical diversity issues will be addressed, detail validation methods for synthetic ethical dilemmas, and embed concrete milestones with resource and timeline estimates to ensure the benchmark's development can be realistically executed within typical research constraints and ethical frameworks. Without this, the ambitious multitask nature risks becoming unmanageable or ethically problematic in practice, undermining the benchmark's reliability and acceptance by the community.

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating, the idea stands to gain significant impact and distinctiveness by integrating 'vision-language models' and 'multimodal interactions' into the benchmark. For example, incorporating healthcare robots' perception input (e.g., images or videos of patient environments) alongside dialogue and clinical data could enable evaluation of LLMs' commonsense and ethical reasoning in more lifelike HRI scenarios. Additionally, embedding health equity considerations as a key metric could advance trustworthiness and fairness evaluation within clinical decision support. This global integration would deepen the benchmark's relevance across multiple research domains, increase novelty, and align it with emerging trends in multimodal AI and trustworthy healthcare robotics, broadening its utility and appeal.
