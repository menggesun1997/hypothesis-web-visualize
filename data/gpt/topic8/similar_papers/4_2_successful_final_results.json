    "title": "Health-informed Ethical Auditing and Accountability Mechanisms for Social Media LLM Moderation",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM content moderation lacks rigorous, transparent accountability systems inspired by public health ethics that robustly safeguard against biases and misinformation propagation.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the external gap of leveraging health science public ethics to create robust auditing systems improving accountability and fairness in social media moderation, a novel interdisciplinary approach outlined in the innovation opportunities.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an auditing system borrowing epidemiological models of misinformation spread and health ethics principles for casualty minimization. The system incorporates accountability logs with blockchain technology ensuring tamper-proof traceability of moderation decisions. It provides visibility into model biases, flagged misinformation clusters, and impact assessment metrics to stakeholders.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect social media datasets containing misinformation and biased posts annotated by health communication experts. 2. Implement the health-inspired auditing framework alongside a standard LLM moderator. 3. Measure misinformation containment effectiveness, transparency (via stakeholder interpretability), and auditing performance (precision, recall). 4. Conduct simulated audits with ethical committees modeling public health review panels for validation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Posts containing health misinformation about vaccines flagged by LLM moderators. Expected Output: Auditing system produces an immutable log of moderation rationale, quantifies misinformation spread risks, and recommends corrective measures based on ethical health frameworks.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain integration introduces latency, adopt cryptographic commitments or distributed ledgers with simplified consensus protocols. If epidemiological models underperform, enhance them with social network analysis algorithms from sociology to better capture misinformation dynamics."

        "title": "Health-Informed Ethical Auditing and Accountability Mechanisms for Social Media LLM Moderation within Emerging AI Regulatory Frameworks",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language model (LLM) content moderation systems suffer from insufficient transparent, accountable auditing mechanisms that integrate public health ethics and systematically address misinformation and bias propagation. Moreover, these mechanisms lack explicit alignment with emerging AI governance and legal frameworks such as the Artificial Intelligence Act and Digital Services Act, which mandate robust transparency, liability, and human rights considerations. There is a critical gap in designing operational auditing frameworks grounded in epidemiological modeling of misinformation spread, embedded blockchain-based accountability, and compliance with contemporary AI legal duties to effectively uphold ethical moderation standards on social media platforms.",
        "Motivation": "This research addresses the competitive frontier of ethical AI auditing by uniquely combining interdisciplinary methodologies: epidemiological models from public health to quantitatively track misinformation dynamics; blockchain technology for tamper-resistant audit trails; and explicit embedding within EU regulations like the AI Act and Digital Services Act to fulfill legal transparency and liability obligations. By integrating health science ethics with AI governance mandates and human rights law, our approach transcends existing moderation audits, promising unprecedented robustness, interpretability, and regulatory compliance in combating misinformation and bias on social media. This integrated framework aims not only for technical innovation but to influence policy-driven AI accountability practices.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel, multi-layered auditing system for LLM-based social media moderation, consisting of: (1) an epidemiological misinformation spread model quantitatively parameterized to estimate contagion rates and clusters of harmful content; these model metrics directly inform the auditing outputs by quantifying real-time misinformation risk and impact measures that guide moderation intensity and prioritization; (2) a permissioned blockchain infrastructure designed for performance with rapid consensus protocols (e.g., PBFT), recording immutable moderation decisions, rationale, and epidemiological risk assessments, accessible to stakeholders including platform operators, regulators, and ethical review boards via secure APIs; (3) an AI ethics compliance module explicitly aligned with the Artificial Intelligence Act and Digital Services Act requirements, embedding legal duties and human rights principles—such as fairness, transparency, and non-discrimination—into audit report templates and corrective action recommendations; (4) a human-in-the-loop ethical review process modeled on public health ethics boards leveraging the 'veil of ignorance' principle to ensure unbiased, fair audit interpretations; and (5) comprehensive system architecture diagrams and prototype workflows detailing integration points and data flows between epidemiological metrics, blockchain ledger entries, and regulatory compliance checks. This design guarantees operational feasibility, regulatory alignment, and robust accountability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Acquire and curate diverse social media datasets enriched with health misinformation (e.g., COVID-19 vaccines), annotated by health communication and legal experts to capture biases and misinformation taxonomy. 2. Develop and calibrate the epidemiological misinformation spread model on these datasets to produce quantitative risk scores and cluster identifications. 3. Implement the permissioned blockchain prototype using a practical consensus protocol suited for operational performance; integrate APIs for transparent stakeholder data access to immutable audit records. 4. Build the AI ethics compliance module incorporating legal and human rights frameworks, generating audit compliance reports and suggested interventions aligned with EU regulations. 5. Conduct controlled simulations where the auditing framework reviews outputs from an LLM moderator, measuring misinformation containment effectiveness, audit traceability, transparency to stakeholders, and legal compliance indicators. 6. Organize ethical review panels employing the 'veil of ignorance' to implicate fairness in audit interpretations and feedback loops. 7. Iterate system design based on quantitative and qualitative assessment outcomes.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Health misinformation posts regarding vaccine efficacy flagged by the LLM moderator. Expected Output: (a) The epidemiological model estimates contagion rate, highlighting misinformation clusters; (b) The blockchain ledger records immutable entries detailing moderation rationale linked to spread risk scores; (c) Compliance reports map audit outcomes to Artificial Intelligence Act transparency and liability mandates; (d) Ethical review board feedback incorporates veil of ignorance reflections to validate fairness; (e) The system recommends targeted corrective strategies balancing public health ethics and legal duties.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should blockchain integration incur unacceptable latency or complexity, transition to optimized cryptographic commitment schemes combined with distributed ledger technologies employing simplified consensus protocols, preserving immutable audit trails with improved performance. If epidemiological models underperform in capturing misinformation dynamics, enhance them using advanced social network analysis algorithms from sociology and nutrition science networks (inspired by International Union of Nutritional Sciences methodologies) to model information propagation more accurately. Additionally, if legal integration proves challenging, establish modular compliance layers that can be iteratively refined in collaboration with AI governance experts."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed method intriguingly combines epidemiological models with blockchain-based accountability, it lacks clarity on how these components concretely integrate to audit LLM moderation systems. Specifically, how the epidemiological models quantitatively influence moderation decisions or auditing metrics remains underexplained. Additionally, the feasibility and design of blockchain integration—e.g., the type of blockchain, performance impact, and stakeholder access protocols—need elaboration to ensure a clear, operational mechanism rather than a high-level concept. Detailed workflows, system architecture diagrams, or prototype descriptions would substantially strengthen soundness here, providing reviewers and practitioners confidence in the technical viability and reasoning behind the approach. Clarify these mechanistic details to avoid ambiguity about how auditing outputs are produced and anchored in public health ethics principles within LLM moderation contexts, ensuring soundness in technical conception and justification (Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_content": "Given that novelty is marked as competitive, explicitly integrating relevant regulatory and legal frameworks such as the \"Artificial Intelligence Act\" and the \"Digital Services Act\" could substantially enhance impact and novelty. Embedding the auditing mechanism within the compliance context these laws demand—e.g., demonstrating how health-informed auditing helps satisfy AI transparency or misinformation liability requirements—would position the work at the intersection of AI ethics, law, and public health. This would also broaden stakeholder relevance, connecting ethical auditing not only to technical robustness but also to demonstrable legal accountability and human rights (e.g., referencing \"legal duty\" or \"human rights law\" concepts). Such integration advances the interdisciplinarity of the work, fosters practical adoption, and addresses the competitive novelty challenge by aligning the research tightly with emerging governance paradigms, enhancing both impact and practical feasibility (Problem_Statement, Proposed_Method, Impact)."
