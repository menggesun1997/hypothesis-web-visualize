    "title": "Health-informed Ethical Auditing and Accountability Mechanisms for Social Media LLM Moderation",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM content moderation lacks rigorous, transparent accountability systems inspired by public health ethics that robustly safeguard against biases and misinformation propagation.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the external gap of leveraging health science public ethics to create robust auditing systems improving accountability and fairness in social media moderation, a novel interdisciplinary approach outlined in the innovation opportunities.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an auditing system borrowing epidemiological models of misinformation spread and health ethics principles for casualty minimization. The system incorporates accountability logs with blockchain technology ensuring tamper-proof traceability of moderation decisions. It provides visibility into model biases, flagged misinformation clusters, and impact assessment metrics to stakeholders.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect social media datasets containing misinformation and biased posts annotated by health communication experts. 2. Implement the health-inspired auditing framework alongside a standard LLM moderator. 3. Measure misinformation containment effectiveness, transparency (via stakeholder interpretability), and auditing performance (precision, recall). 4. Conduct simulated audits with ethical committees modeling public health review panels for validation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Posts containing health misinformation about vaccines flagged by LLM moderators. Expected Output: Auditing system produces an immutable log of moderation rationale, quantifies misinformation spread risks, and recommends corrective measures based on ethical health frameworks.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain integration introduces latency, adopt cryptographic commitments or distributed ledgers with simplified consensus protocols. If epidemiological models underperform, enhance them with social network analysis algorithms from sociology to better capture misinformation dynamics."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed method intriguingly combines epidemiological models with blockchain-based accountability, it lacks clarity on how these components concretely integrate to audit LLM moderation systems. Specifically, how the epidemiological models quantitatively influence moderation decisions or auditing metrics remains underexplained. Additionally, the feasibility and design of blockchain integration—e.g., the type of blockchain, performance impact, and stakeholder access protocols—need elaboration to ensure a clear, operational mechanism rather than a high-level concept. Detailed workflows, system architecture diagrams, or prototype descriptions would substantially strengthen soundness here, providing reviewers and practitioners confidence in the technical viability and reasoning behind the approach. Clarify these mechanistic details to avoid ambiguity about how auditing outputs are produced and anchored in public health ethics principles within LLM moderation contexts, ensuring soundness in technical conception and justification (Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_content": "Given that novelty is marked as competitive, explicitly integrating relevant regulatory and legal frameworks such as the \"Artificial Intelligence Act\" and the \"Digital Services Act\" could substantially enhance impact and novelty. Embedding the auditing mechanism within the compliance context these laws demand—e.g., demonstrating how health-informed auditing helps satisfy AI transparency or misinformation liability requirements—would position the work at the intersection of AI ethics, law, and public health. This would also broaden stakeholder relevance, connecting ethical auditing not only to technical robustness but also to demonstrable legal accountability and human rights (e.g., referencing \"legal duty\" or \"human rights law\" concepts). Such integration advances the interdisciplinarity of the work, fosters practical adoption, and addresses the competitive novelty challenge by aligning the research tightly with emerging governance paradigms, enhancing both impact and practical feasibility (Problem_Statement, Proposed_Method, Impact)."
