        "title": "Cross-Contextual Ethical Auditing Frameworks for LLMs in Social Media Moderation",
        "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of integrative frameworks that dynamically audit ethical implications and biases of LLMs across diverse sociocultural contexts during social media content moderation, resulting in siloed and static evaluations that fail to generalize or adapt.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical gap of siloed treatment of ethical challenges, privacy, and sociocultural contexts by proposing a framework that integrates these factors dynamically, enabling auditing mechanisms tailored to diverse contexts as identified in the critical gaps section.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-layered auditing framework that combines real-time cultural context embeddings, privacy calculus theories, and bias detection modules to evaluate LLM outputs dynamically. The system employs federated learning to collect anonymized contextual feedback from multiple geographic regions, integrating sociocultural norms and privacy preferences into the auditing process, and uses explainable AI methods to surface potential ethical breaches or biases in content moderation decisions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate a cross-cultural social media dataset with annotated content reflecting diverse ethical norms. 2. Implement the multi-layered auditing framework integrated with a state-of-the-art LLM moderating social content. 3. Compare performance against baseline static auditing tools focusing only on bias detection. 4. Evaluate metrics including bias mitigation effectiveness, false positive/negative rates, user trust through surveys, and privacy preservation measured through information leakage analysis.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A social media post containing culturally sensitive political commentary that may be flagged differently in Western vs. East Asian contexts. Expected Output: The auditing framework flags potential bias in content moderation decisions reflecting different cultural norms and provides an explanation for context-dependent moderation decisions, preserving user privacy and fairness.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic auditing proves too resource-intensive, fallback to modular offline assessments incorporating periodic cultural updates. Additionally, reduce dimensionality of context embeddings or switch to rule-based ethical constraints if federated learning data collection faces privacy hurdles."

        "title": "Federated Multi-party Privacy-enhancing Bias Mitigation for LLMs in Social Media",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM-based social media moderation systems lack integrated privacy-preserving mechanisms combined with bias mitigation that protect user data while ensuring equitable moderation across demographics.",
        "Motivation": "Fills the external gap around underexplored intersections between social data and privacy protection mechanisms by proposing a federated learning system incorporating advanced privacy-enhancing technologies and bias mitigation strategies.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a federated learning architecture where user data never leaves devices; local models learn personalized bias correction factors based on differential privacy guarantees. Aggregation servers combine locally learned bias mitigation insights without exposing raw data. The system includes adaptive privacy budget allocation sensitive to user trust levels and content sensitivity to balance privacy and utility aggressively.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble a dataset of multilingual social media posts labeled for harmful biases and ethical violations. 2. Implement baseline centralized bias mitigation models and federated counterparts with differential privacy. 3. Measure bias reduction, model accuracy, privacy leakage, and user trust in simulations. 4. Test scalability and robustness on synthetic federated data distributions reflecting real social media user diversity.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A batch of posts with demographic bias issues (e.g., against a minority group) processed locally on user devices. Expected Output: The federated model effectively reduces biased moderation decisions compared to centralized baselines, with quantifiable privacy guarantees and no raw data exposure.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "In case federated learning convergence is suboptimal, switch to hybrid decentralized architectures or apply trusted execution environments for secure model updates. Alternatively, reduce privacy constraints for less sensitive data subsets to improve utility."

        "title": "Health-informed Ethical Auditing and Accountability Mechanisms for Social Media LLM Moderation",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLM content moderation lacks rigorous, transparent accountability systems inspired by public health ethics that robustly safeguard against biases and misinformation propagation.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the external gap of leveraging health science public ethics to create robust auditing systems improving accountability and fairness in social media moderation, a novel interdisciplinary approach outlined in the innovation opportunities.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an auditing system borrowing epidemiological models of misinformation spread and health ethics principles for casualty minimization. The system incorporates accountability logs with blockchain technology ensuring tamper-proof traceability of moderation decisions. It provides visibility into model biases, flagged misinformation clusters, and impact assessment metrics to stakeholders.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect social media datasets containing misinformation and biased posts annotated by health communication experts. 2. Implement the health-inspired auditing framework alongside a standard LLM moderator. 3. Measure misinformation containment effectiveness, transparency (via stakeholder interpretability), and auditing performance (precision, recall). 4. Conduct simulated audits with ethical committees modeling public health review panels for validation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Posts containing health misinformation about vaccines flagged by LLM moderators. Expected Output: Auditing system produces an immutable log of moderation rationale, quantifies misinformation spread risks, and recommends corrective measures based on ethical health frameworks.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain integration introduces latency, adopt cryptographic commitments or distributed ledgers with simplified consensus protocols. If epidemiological models underperform, enhance them with social network analysis algorithms from sociology to better capture misinformation dynamics."

        "title": "Dynamic Socioculturally Adaptive Prompt Engineering for Hallucination Reduction in Multilingual LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing prompt engineering techniques inadequately address hallucination and ethical guardrails for multilingual, culturally diverse LLMs used in social media moderation, particularly for non-Western languages such as Chinese.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap around hallucination and contextual ethical guardrails in diverse linguistic models by creatively fusing prompt engineering with sociocultural contextual modeling and privacy technologies to dynamically adapt prompts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create an adaptive prompt generation system that leverages cultural knowledge graphs and user privacy profiles to generate context-tailored prompts minimizing hallucinations. The system dynamically adjusts prompt structures based on detected sociocultural context, integrating privacy-preserving filters ensuring ethical compliance with local norms and user preferences.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Gather multilingual social media datasets including Chinese and other underrepresented languages with annotations for hallucination incidences. 2. Develop baseline prompt engineering approaches and compare with adaptive prompt system that incorporates cultural context vectors and privacy filters. 3. Evaluate hallucination frequency, moderation bias, user satisfaction, and cultural appropriateness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Moderation prompt for a Chinese social media post containing ambiguous idiomatic expressions. Expected Output: The system generates a culturally aware prompt that reduces hallucinated content in model responses and respects local privacy expectations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If cultural knowledge graph integration is ineffective, fallback to using pretrained contextual embeddings fine-tuned on cultural corpora. If privacy filters impede model performance, relax thresholds or employ user opt-ins for specific categories of content."
