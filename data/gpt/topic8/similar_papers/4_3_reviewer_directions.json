    "title": "Dynamic Socioculturally Adaptive Prompt Engineering for Hallucination Reduction in Multilingual LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing prompt engineering techniques inadequately address hallucination and ethical guardrails for multilingual, culturally diverse LLMs used in social media moderation, particularly for non-Western languages such as Chinese.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap around hallucination and contextual ethical guardrails in diverse linguistic models by creatively fusing prompt engineering with sociocultural contextual modeling and privacy technologies to dynamically adapt prompts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an adaptive prompt generation system that leverages cultural knowledge graphs and user privacy profiles to generate context-tailored prompts minimizing hallucinations. The system dynamically adjusts prompt structures based on detected sociocultural context, integrating privacy-preserving filters ensuring ethical compliance with local norms and user preferences.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Gather multilingual social media datasets including Chinese and other underrepresented languages with annotations for hallucination incidences. 2. Develop baseline prompt engineering approaches and compare with adaptive prompt system that incorporates cultural context vectors and privacy filters. 3. Evaluate hallucination frequency, moderation bias, user satisfaction, and cultural appropriateness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Moderation prompt for a Chinese social media post containing ambiguous idiomatic expressions. Expected Output: The system generates a culturally aware prompt that reduces hallucinated content in model responses and respects local privacy expectations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cultural knowledge graph integration is ineffective, fallback to using pretrained contextual embeddings fine-tuned on cultural corpora. If privacy filters impede model performance, relax thresholds or employ user opt-ins for specific categories of content."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an adaptive prompt generation system leveraging cultural knowledge graphs and privacy-preserving filters, but lacks sufficient detail on how these components will dynamically interact during prompt adaptation and hallucination mitigation. Clarify mechanisms for integrating cultural knowledge with privacy profiles, specify the adaptation process, and describe how ethical compliance and hallucination reduction are quantitatively operationalized within the system's workflow to strengthen soundness and reproducibility of the approach. Provide concrete algorithmic or architectural design sketches or pseudo-code to elucidate this novel fusion clearly and reduce ambiguity about feasibility and effectiveness in practice. This will help reviewers and practitioners assess the scientific and technical credibility of the proposed solution thoroughly and enable stronger evaluation in experiments, which is critical for a competitive area like this one under the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty status. This also reduces potential risks that core assumptions about system behavior under varied sociocultural contexts remain unsupported due to vagueness in method descriptions, addressing implicit [SOU-ASSUMPTION] concerns tied to mechanism clarity as well, but focusing here on specification of the mechanisms explicitly is primary to improve the proposal quality and confidence in novelty claims.

          "feedback_content": "Given the highly competitive nature of this line of work and the societal relevance of multilingual, culturally aware AI systems indicated by your Problem_Statement and Motivation, consider integrating your research more explicitly with 'human-computer interaction' and 'educational practice' domains from the offered globally-linked concepts. For example, extending your adaptive prompt engineering approach to support language education or digital library content moderation in diverse educational contexts could substantially broaden impact while driving novel interdisciplinary applications. Partnering with 'language teacher education programs' or 'language learning' researchers might enable new use cases for your system beyond social media moderation, increasing societal usefulness and appeal to a wider audience. You could incorporate evaluation metrics related to language pedagogy effectiveness or learner engagement in multilingual environments, tying your technical advances to measurable educational outcomes. This would heighten both the novelty and impact values, addressing the challenge of a competitive niche by grounding your work in broader human-centered contexts.
