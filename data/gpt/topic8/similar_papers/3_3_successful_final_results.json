    "title": "Semantic Feature-Driven Generative Replay for Privacy-Aware Continual Learning in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Data replay techniques improve continual learning but storing past raw data conflicts with privacy concerns, especially in federated or sensitive domains. There is a need for efficient, privacy-aware replay methods leveraging semantic features in LLM continual adaptation.",
    "Motivation": "This addresses the external novel gap of connecting semantic feature representations with data replay under privacy constraints identified as a hidden bridge in the analysis. It innovates by combining generative replay of semantic feature representations with continual updating, advancing beyond existing replay buffer or raw data storage approaches.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a semantic feature-driven generative replay approach where a generative model (e.g., a lightweight VAE or GAN) learns to generate compressed semantic embeddings of prior data classes instead of raw text. The LLM leverages these generated embeddings in replay during continual learning phases without accessing original data. The semantic generative model is trained jointly with the main LLM but stored and transmitted as benign feature representations, ensuring privacy and communication efficiency. Replay frequency and sampling are dynamically controlled based on importance scores derived from knowledge distillation losses.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select incremental NLP tasks with privacy-sensitive data (e.g., personal conversation datasets). 2) Train base LLM and semantic generative replay models. 3) Perform continual learning experiments comparing standard replay, no replay, and generative semantic replay. 4) Evaluate retention accuracy, privacy leakage risks (via membership inference attacks), and computational cost. 5) Assess scalability with increasing numbers of incremental classes and clients in federated setups.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Scenario: A financial institution updates an LLM with new incremental customer intents while ensuring no raw personal data is stored or shared. The system generates semantic embeddings replayed during training, maintaining intent classification accuracy without privacy compromise.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If generative replay quality is insufficient, try distilling semantic embeddings from larger pretrained encoders or use hybrid replay combining partial raw data for benign classes. Alternatively, investigate differential privacy noise addition combined with replay buffers."

        "title": "Federated Semantic Feature-Driven Generative Replay for Privacy-Aware Continual Learning in Large Language Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "Continual learning for large language models (LLMs) faces critical challenges in preserving knowledge over time while respecting stringent privacy constraints, especially when dealing with sensitive data (e.g., personal, health, or financial). Conventional replay methods that store and reuse raw data are incompatible with privacy requirements and may cause communication inefficiencies in decentralized environments. There is an urgent need for privacy-preserving continual learning mechanisms that leverage semantic-level data abstractions to enable knowledge retention without raw data exposure. Moreover, integrating these mechanisms into federated incremental learning (FL) frameworks to collaboratively learn across multiple clients without exchanging sensitive data remains an underexplored but impactful frontier. Addressing intelligent replay scheduling and communication-efficient semantic generative replay in such federated settings is vital for advancing human-centric AI systems capable of personalized, privacy-aware, and scalable continual learning.",
        "Motivation": "While generative replay and semantic embeddings have been explored separately in continual learning, their combination within a federated incremental learning context with explicit privacy and communication guarantees is novel and essential. Prior work often lacks integration of semantic generative replay with system-level considerations like client heterogeneity, communication overhead, and adaptive replay scheduling tied to knowledge importance metrics. Our approach innovates by jointly training semantic feature-driven generative models alongside LLMs in a federated setup, enabling replay without raw data sharing and with rigorous privacy preservation. This also facilitates personalized model updates respecting client-specific data distributions, addressing a key gap in human-centric AI and FL literature. By formalizing architectures, training objectives, and adaptive replay mechanisms for federated continual learning, we contribute a robust, practical, and theoretically grounded framework that advances privacy-aware knowledge retention with enhanced novelty and competitiveness.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a Federated Semantic Feature-Driven Generative Replay (Fed-SFGR) framework, integrating semantic generative replay into decentralized continual learning of LLMs with privacy guarantees and intelligent adaptive scheduling. Key components include:\n\n1. Semantic Embedding Definition & Extraction: We define semantic embeddings as lower-dimensional latent vectors generated by a pretrained, privacy-preserving encoder (e.g., frozen transformer layers or VAE encoders fine-tuned on local data), carefully designed to preserve task-relevant features while obfuscating identifiable raw data attributes. Privacy is quantified via formal metrics (e.g., differential privacy bounds) and validated empirically by adversarial membership inference attacks.\n\n2. Generative Replay Model:\n  - Architecture: Lightweight VAEs or GANs parameterize semantic feature distributions per incremental class/task, trained locally on clients to learn compressed semantic representations.\n  - Joint Training: During federated continual learning rounds, the generative model and LLM models are updated jointly via multi-task loss functions combining task performance, reconstruction fidelity of semantic features, and adversarial privacy regularization terms.\n\n3. Federated Learning Protocol:\n  - Each client maintains local semantic generative replay models and LLM adapters.\n  - Model updates and generative model parameters (not raw embeddings) are communicated to a central server for aggregation via secure aggregation protocols.\n  - Client heterogeneity is addressed by personalized model components and server-side distillation.\n\n4. Adaptive Replay Scheduling:\n  - We formalize a knowledge importance score derived from knowledge distillation loss between the current LLM and previous versions.\n  - Replay frequency and sample selection probabilities dynamically adjust based on these scores to prioritize retention of vital semantic features, optimizing computational and communication budgets.\n\n5. Algorithmic Summary:\n  1) Extract semantic embeddings from new data via privacy-preserving encoders.\n  2) Train/update generative replay modules locally.\n  3) Compute knowledge importance scores for replay scheduling.\n  4) Perform local continual learning with generative replay samples.\n  5) Communicate model updates to server; aggregate globally.\n  6) Update client models with aggregated parameters.\n\nThis methodology uniquely bridges semantic feature-driven generative replay with federated incremental learning, providing a scalable, privacy-aware, and communication-efficient continual learning paradigm for LLMs.\n\nPseudocode and formal loss functions detailing the joint optimization and adaptive scheduling mechanisms will be provided in supplementary materials to promote reproducibility and clarity.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset and Task Selection:\n   - Curate incremental NLP tasks involving privacy-sensitive data domains such as personal conversations, financial intents, and health-related notes.\n   - Simulate multi-client federated environments with heterogeneous data distributions.\n\n2) Baseline Establishment:\n   - Train base LLM models and implement federated continual learning baselines: no replay, raw data replay (centralized and federated variants), and naive semantic feature replay without adaptation.\n\n3) Implement Fed-SFGR:\n   - Build semantic encoders, generative replay models, and adaptive scheduling modules.\n   - Integrate into federated learning workflow with secure aggregation.\n\n4) Evaluation Metrics:\n   - Accuracy retention on incremental tasks.\n   - Privacy leakage assessment via membership inference and attribute inference attacks.\n   - Communication cost and computational efficiency analyses.\n   - Scalability analysis with increasing client numbers and incremental classes.\n\n5) Ablation Studies:\n   - Effectiveness of adaptive replay scheduling vs. fixed intervals.\n   - Impact of generative model architecture choices (VAE vs GAN).\n   - Privacy-utility trade-offs with varying privacy budgets.\n\n6) Case Study:\n   - Realistic deployment simulation in a financial institution setting with multiple clients updating customer intent models collaboratively without raw data exchange.\n\n7) Statistical Analysis:\n   - Perform repeated trials with appropriate statistical tests to validate significance of results.\n\n8) Release details:\n   - Open-source code, pretrained models, and reproducible experiment configurations to foster community adoption.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Scenario: Several geographically distributed financial institutions collaboratively update a shared LLM-based intent recognition model capturing emerging customer intents. Raw personal transaction data and conversation logs remain strictly on-premise due to privacy and regulatory constraints. Each client trains a semantic encoder and generative replay model locally to encapsulate incremental customer intent features into compressed embeddings. The federated system exchanges only model updates and semantic replay parameters, preventing leakage of sensitive raw texts. Federated adaptive replay scheduling dynamically prioritizes retention of vital customer intents that demonstrate high knowledge importance scores during model drift. This setup permits continuous LLM adaptation across institutions, maintaining high classification performance while rigorously enforcing privacy protection and minimizing communication overhead.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If generative replay model performance degrades under privacy constraints or client heterogeneity impairs federated aggregation, we will explore several mitigation strategies:\n\n- Integrate pretrained large-scale encoders to distill more robust semantic embeddings prior to local adaptation.\n- Employ hybrid replay combining limited, privacy-approved synthetic raw data samples for critical classes.\n- Incorporate formal differential privacy mechanisms (e.g., adding calibrated noise) into embedding generation and communication.\n- Adjust federated protocol to exploit clustering or personalized federated learning to better handle heterogeneity.\n- Introduce reinforcement learning agents to optimize replay scheduling policies beyond heuristic knowledge importance scores, thus enhancing adaptive replay efficiency."

Specifically, the proposal should clarify how semantic embeddings are defined and ensured to preserve task-relevant information while guaranteeing privacy. Additionally, the mechanism to dynamically control replay frequency and sampling based on knowledge distillation losses requires clearer formalization and justification. Defining architectures, training objectives, and privacy guarantees more concretely will significantly strengthen soundness and reproducibility prospects within the design section of Proposed_Methods, making the approach more convincing for adoption and evaluation in privacy-sensitive continual learning contexts especially with LLMs acting on textual embeddings rather than raw data directly. Providing more precise algorithmic descriptions or pseudocode could also improve clarity and robustness in understanding this novel approach’s practicality and theoretical underpinnings at scale in federated or incremental learning setups.  Targeting the Proposed_Method section explicitly for these enhancements is critical to solidify the foundation of the research idea's novelty and validity in competitive settings involving privacy-preserving replay and semantic feature manipulation for LLMs.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the competitive novelty rating and the strong thematic overlap with federated incremental learning and human-centric AI, integrating federated learning (FL) system design explicitly into the research scope would substantially broaden impact and novelty. For example, incorporating a multi-client federated continual learning scenario where semantic generative replay models are collaboratively trained and shared without raw data exchange leverages the concept of federated incremental learning and privacy-preserving model sharing. This integration can align well with emerging human-centric AI requirements by addressing personalized model updates across diverse sensitive domains (e.g., finance, health sensing) while maintaining communication efficiency and privacy. \n\nExplicitly linking and benchmarking the approach under realistic FL system constraints (e.g., communication overhead, client heterogeneity, privacy budgets) and exploring intelligent decision-making strategies for replay scheduling could provide a compelling, novel contribution beyond existing replay buffer or raw data approaches. Positioning the work at this intersection can transform the idea from a narrowly scoped incremental learning method into a robust, scalable privacy-aware continual learning framework for decentralized environments, which is a timely and high-impact direction. Encouraging the authors to leverage the provided globally-linked concepts to structure future extensions or experimental setups is highly recommended for elevating the submission's significance and competitiveness in premier venues.\n\nThis suggestion targets broadening the Problem_Statement, Proposed_Method, and Experiment_Plan sections to strategically integrate federated incremental learning and human-centric AI dimensions, thus enhancing the research’s visibility and relevance in the community."
