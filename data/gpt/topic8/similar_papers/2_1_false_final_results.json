    "title": "Language-Guided Simulation Framework for Rare Autonomous Driving Scenarios Using Foundation Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Autonomous driving systems fail to robustly handle long-tail, rare traffic scenarios due to scarcity of labeled data and insufficient contextual understanding in current simulation frameworks.",
    "Motivation": "Directly responds to the external gap identified by linking language model methodologies with autonomous driving datasets to simulate rare scenarios. The innovation lies in leveraging powerful language foundation models to guide scenario generation and scene understanding, offering unprecedented coverage and realism in training autonomous agents under uncertainty.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a hybrid simulation platform where a language foundation model generates natural language descriptions of rare traffic events and guides scene composition by conditioning on multimodal driving data. Integrate a semantic scene generator driven by language prompts and an LLM-based evaluator that iteratively refines scenario difficulty and plausibility. The system facilitates scalable generation of annotated rare-event datasets for robust policy training.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather and curate autonomous driving datasets featuring rare events. 2) Fine-tune a large language foundation model to generate scenario descriptions reflecting real-world traffic edge cases. 3) Develop a multimodal scene synthesis engine that translates language prompts into rich driving environment simulations. 4) Use generated scenarios to retrain autonomous driving perception and planning modules. 5) Evaluate improvements on rare-event detection, false-positive reduction, and safety-critical intervention timing, comparing with standard simulated datasets.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt - \"A pedestrian suddenly steps onto the crosswalk from behind a parked truck on a rainy evening.\" Output: A simulated driving scene with occlusions and weather effects requiring urgent braking decisions, accompanied by annotated sensor data and system reactions.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct language-to-scene translation is challenging, introduce intermediate semantic templates or scene graph generation as scaffolding. Incorporate human-in-the-loop refinement to iteratively improve scenario realism and alignment with safety objectives."
