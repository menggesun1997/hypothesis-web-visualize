        "title": "Narrative-Historicity Embeddings to Enhance Semantic Depth of LLM Knowledge",
        "Problem_Statement": "Semantic encoding in LLMs lacks the dimension of textual historicity, missing out on contextual richness provided by narrative evolution and historic discourse analysis.",
        "Motivation": "While prior approaches have integrated temporal signals or external knowledge into LLMs, they often treat historical data atomistically and neglect the rich, evolving narrative context present in literary and historical discourses. This proposal uniquely bridges literary historicity, discourse analysis, and AI by embedding temporal and narrative contexts into LLM knowledge representations. By grounding encyclopedic facts within narrative arcs and historic discourse frameworks, the method aims to achieve a qualitatively deeper semantic understanding that reflects cultural and historical evolution, surpassing conventional temporal embeddings. This combination exploits insights from discourse and media studies, emphasizing the role of narrative structures and collective memory in shaping meaning, thus positioning the approach at the frontier of semantic enrichment for open-domain QA.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We introduce a multi-component architecture integrating historical-semantic embeddings with LLMs through a carefully designed attention fusion mechanism that preserves model stability and semantic nuance. First, temporal embeddings are learned via time-aware transformers trained on large-scale diachronic corpora, capturing evolving language use and concept drift. Simultaneously, narrative arc detectors based on multimodal discourse analysis—leveraging textual features alongside cinematic discourse principles from media studies—extract structural narrative representations capturing plot dynamics and rhetorical patterns across historical periods. These embeddings form complementary vector spaces: temporal embeddings encode timestamped semantic shifts, while narrative embeddings encode discourse trajectory and cultural context. Integration occurs via a dual-attention fusion layer positioned post-Language Model self-attention blocks: the base token embeddings attend to these enriched contexts, modulating attention weights dynamically without direct concatenation to input embeddings. This ensures that historical and narrative signals act as side information influencing token relevance and generation probabilities. The fusion layer employs gating mechanisms to balance contributions, preventing destabilization and excessive model complexity. Grounded in interpretive theory from discourse analysis and borrowing gating design principles from recent multimodal transformers, this architecture uniquely melds memory studies of cultural narratives with LLM reasoning processes, enabling contextually deep, temporally-aware semantic generation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Curation: Assemble a multi-source corpus integrating encyclopedic facts linked with detailed literary, historical, and discourse-analytic annotations, drawing from established diachronic databases (e.g., COHA) and public literary archives. Employ expert curators with domain knowledge in history and media studies to ensure annotation quality and consistency. To mitigate manual effort, develop semi-automated annotation tools guided by discourse analysis frameworks. 2) Embedding Model Training: Train temporal embeddings with supervised time-aware transformer objectives capturing semantic drift. Concurrently, develop narrative arc detectors incorporating discourse and cinematic narrative features, validated against human-annotated narrative segmentations. 3) Model Integration: Implement the dual-attention fusion layers within a transformer-based LLM architecture, carefully tuning gating mechanisms to preserve fluent generation. 4) Benchmarking: Evaluate on a suite of temporally sensitive QA datasets (e.g., TimeQA) augmented with new narrative interpretation tasks created in collaboration with historians and discourse analysts. 5) Evaluation: Define semantic depth and contextual fidelity metrics based on adapted validated rating schemas from discourse analysis research, and conduct comprehensive expert human evaluations. 6) Ablation Studies: Perform systematic removal of temporal and narrative components and compare against strong baselines including vanilla LLMs and simple concatenative augmentation, quantifying each component's contribution to performance and semantic depth. This design ensures transparency of effect, robustness, and clear attribution of gains.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'How did the perception of democracy evolve from Ancient Greece to Enlightenment Europe?' Expected Output: A nuanced answer contextualizing the concept's evolution by referencing specific historical narratives, key political treatises, and cultural discourse shifts captured in literary sources, illustrating changing ideological frameworks over time. For instance, the model invokes classical Athenian polity narratives, the impact of Roman republican ideals, Renaissance humanism perspectives, and Enlightenment-era social contract theories, weaving them into a cohesive, historically grounded response.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If embedding sparsity or integration challenges persist, fallback to a modular approach employing explicit feature extraction followed by selective concatenation with token embeddings limited to discrete, manually curated historical epochs. These modules will act independently, allowing isolated experimentation. Additionally, incorporate memory-inspired external retrieval modules from discourse analysis to supplement embeddings dynamically, and explore incremental fine-tuning regimes focusing on smaller historical subdomains to stabilize learning before full integration."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section outlines an innovative approach to integrating temporal and narrative context into LLM embeddings, yet it lacks clarity on critical technical details. Specifically, it is unclear how the time-aware transformers and narrative arc detectors will be architecturally integrated with existing LLM attention mechanisms beyond the mention of 'attention fusion layers'. This high-level description leaves ambiguity around how effectively the historical and narrative signals will be captured, preserved, and influence generation. Consider elaborating on the architectural design—e.g., whether these embeddings augment input embeddings, modify attention scores, or function as side information—and provide a rationale for why this fusion is expected to improve semantic depth without overwhelming or destabilizing the LLM's language modeling capabilities. Clear mechanistic insight will significantly strengthen soundness and reproducibility of the approach, and aid in assessing its feasibility and expected impact effectively. This clarity is essential given the competitive novelty landscape and the complexity of historical semantic integration in LLMs. Target section: Proposed_Method."

First, data curation combining encyclopedic facts with detailed literary and historical annotations is a major undertaking that may require specialized domain knowledge and significant manual effort; the plan currently lacks contingencies for dataset quality, scale, or annotation consistency. Second, metrics for 'semantic depth' and 'contextual fidelity' evaluated by expert human raters need specification—are these rating schemas validated or standardized? The integration of temporal and narrative embeddings with LLMs via attention fusion layers calls for ablation studies and baseline comparisons to isolate contribution and avoid confounding. Lastly, temporally sensitive QA and narrative interpretation tasks are ambitious benchmarks—clarify if off-the-shelf datasets suffices or new benchmarks will be created, which impacts timelines and resource allocation. Improving detail here will enhance feasibility by highlighting resource needs, evaluation criteria, and robustness checks. Target section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan."
