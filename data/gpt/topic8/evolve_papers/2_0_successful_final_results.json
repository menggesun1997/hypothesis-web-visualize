    "title": "Neuro-Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Dynamic Knowledge Assimilation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods rely on static evaluation protocols that inadequately capture the dynamic evolution of LLMs' knowledge as they interact with continually updated world information. This represents a challenge for accurately assessing and improving factuality and bias mitigation in real-time knowledge acquisition.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap of over-reliance on static and retrospective methods and aims to operationalize the high-potential opportunity of cognitive neuroscience-inspired evaluation frameworks by integrating temporal dynamics and psychological constructs into RAG evaluation protocols.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a neuro-adaptive framework leveraging simulated ecological momentary assessment (EMA) paradigms aligned with functional neuroimaging-inspired latent state tracking to monitor LLM internal states during retrieval interaction. The architecture encodes retrieval queries and sources into psychologically interpretable latent features modeled after medial prefrontal cortex activity patterns related to self-perception. These latent features modulate the LLM's generation process dynamically to reflect updated world knowledge and evolving bias profiles, with online bias measurement and correction loops.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compile a temporal knowledge-update dataset simulating real-world news and fact changes. 2) Implement baseline LLMs with standard RAG pipelines. 3) Integrate the proposed latent state tracking using transformer-based encodings simulating neural activation patterns. 4) Develop an evaluation metric suite combining traditional NLP benchmarks with psychological validity indicators (e.g., bias scores over time, factuality drift). 5) Run experiments comparing static versus neuro-adaptive RAG on datasets. 6) Analyze results for improvement in dynamic factuality retention and bias stabilization.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What is the current status of Mars colonization efforts as of today?\" with retrieval indexing including recent discoveries and mission updates. Output: An answer referencing the latest rover missions, incorporating retrieval-augmented data, with confidence and bias assessments indicating temporal knowledge consistency and minimized hallucinations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If neuro-inspired latent features fail to improve evaluation sensitivity, pivot to integrating psychometric personality trait embeddings directly into retrieval query scoring to modulate source trustworthiness, combined with user feedback loops for incremental improvement."

        "title": "Neuro-Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Dynamic Knowledge Assimilation with Explicit Neurocognitive Modulation and Rigorous Validation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods predominantly utilize static evaluation protocols that insufficiently represent the dynamic, temporal evolution of large language models' (LLMs) knowledge as they interact with continuously updated world information streams. This restricts accurate assessment and real-time improvement of factuality and bias mitigation, limiting practical deployment especially in rapidly evolving domains.",
        "Motivation": "While existing RAG frameworks provide valuable mechanisms for knowledge injection into LLM generation, they largely treat retrieval integration as static or heuristic, underexploiting temporal cognitive dynamics and neurocognitive-inspired constructs. Our approach innovates by explicitly modeling LLM internal states with biologically inspired latent features mapped from retrieval queries and sources, grounded in medial prefrontal cortex activity patterns linked to self-perception and belief updating. This neuro-adaptive modulation offers a principled, mechanistic intervention for dynamically integrating and updating knowledge representations within the LLM, ensuring enhanced factuality and bias stability. By rigorously defining and experimentally validating these mechanisms, our work transcends prior metaphorical or loosely inspired methods to deliver a replicable, theoretically justified framework, with practical implications for ethically sound, temporally robust language generation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid neurocognitive-computational architecture combining model-based reasoning with human-computer interaction principles to realize neuro-adaptive RAG with explicit, anatomically and functionally grounded modulation mechanisms. \n\n1) Latent Neurocognitive Feature Extraction: Retrieval queries and their ranked sources are first encoded via transformer-based encoders fine-tuned to predict medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activation patterns derived from publicly available functional neuroimaging datasets associated with self-referential processing and belief updating. This embedding process uses multitask learning to approximate psychological constructs such as confidence and source trustworthiness.\n\n2) Latent State Integration Module (LSIM): These psychologically interpretable latent vectors are integrated directly into the LLM's transformer architecture through specialized cross-attention layers within the decoder stack. Specifically, LSIM modulates query-key-value attention weights by conditioning attention scores on latent states in a gated manner, facilitating dynamic adaptation of attention allocation towards more reliable, temporally relevant retrieved documents.\n\n3) Generation Modulation: The LSIM outputs multiplicatively modulate the decoder’s token logits, effectively biasing generation toward factually supported and less biased outputs. The gating functions are learned end-to-end on a dynamic knowledge-update dataset, with model-based reasoning loss components encouraging consistency across temporal knowledge states.\n\n4) Continuous Online Bias and Factuality Calibration: Inspired by cognitive control in the social brain hypothesis, an auxiliary bias detection head assesses generated text using psychometrically validated metrics aligned with real-world bias constructs. This feedback modulates LSIM gating thresholds online in a closed loop, enabling adaptive bias correction.\n\n5) Scalability and Explainability: We incorporate model interpretability layers that map latent modulations back to psycholinguistic and cognitive constructs, facilitating human-in-the-loop interaction and forensic analysis by domain experts, bridging to the fields of law and forensic medicine specialists.\n\nThis explicit, modular mechanism suite contrasts with prior high-level metaphors by providing transparent, implementable components with theoretical neuroscience grounding and a principled scheme for integrating latent cognitive representations into generation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Construction: Compile a temporal knowledge-update corpus combining news, scientific updates, and social media data with timestamped factual changes, enriched with psychometric evaluations of bias dimensions.\n\n2) Baseline Implementation: Establish standard RAG baselines using state-of-the-art retrieval and generation models without neuro-adaptive modulation.\n\n3) Neuro-Feature Encoder Development: Train transformer encoders to predict mPFC activation patterns from retrieval input features using publicly available functional MRI datasets. Validate encoding accuracy via held-out neuroimaging prediction benchmarks.\n\n4) LSIM Integration: Architect and implement the Latent State Integration Module within the LLM decoder, explicitly detailing gating mechanisms and cross-attention parameterization.\n\n5) Psychological Validity Operationalization: Define bias and factuality drift metrics rigorously—e.g., use hierarchical Bayesian modeling for bias scoring and apply statistical control charts for detecting significant factuality changes over time. Establish thresholds aligned with cognitive science literature.\n\n6) Controlled Pilot Studies: Conduct ablation experiments isolating LSIM and bias feedback loops, evaluating generation quality, bias mitigation, and factuality retention against static RAG on temporal datasets.\n\n7) Scalability and Computational Profiling: Assess computational overhead and latency impact; optimize for deployment scenarios with human-computer interaction scenarios enabling expert forensic review.\n\n8) Statistical Analysis: Use mixed-effects models and significance testing to confirm improvements, reporting confidence intervals and effect sizes.\n\nThis plan ensures empirical rigor, neurocognitive validation, and replicability, addressing prior feasibility concerns.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What is the current status of Mars colonization efforts as of today?\" using retrieval indices updated daily with rover mission logs, scientific publications, and real-time news updates.\n\nExpected Output: A coherent, up-to-date summary referencing latest rover deployments and discoveries, accompanied by:\n- Confidence scores reflecting mPFC-inspired latent state activation indicating epistemic certainty.\n- Bias assessment flags grounded in psychometric bias metrics verifying impartial presentation.\n- Traceable modulation logs showing LSIM's attention gating shifts toward credible, temporally relevant sources.\n\nSample generation snippet: \"As of [current date], Mars colonization efforts continue with the recent deployment of the Perseverance rover conducting unprecedented sub-surface sampling. According to NASA’s latest reports, the mission aims to further assess habitability potential, with no current human presence established.\"\n\nThis output exemplifies dynamic factual updating, bias stability, and neuro-adaptive generation modulation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should neuro-inspired latent features and LSIM gating fail to demonstrate significant improvements or prove computationally infeasible, we will pivot to integrating psychometric personality trait embeddings directly into retrieval query scoring. This approach assigns user trustworthiness profiles and retrieval source reliabilities based on interpretable social brain theory constructs. Combined with real-time user feedback loops in human-computer interaction settings, this fallback will incrementally refine source selection and retrieval relevance, focusing on practical bias mitigation and enhanced factual grounding while reducing model complexity."

However, the mechanism for how these biologically inspired latent states concretely integrate with and modulate the LLM’s generation process lacks clarity and technical detail. The submission should explicitly clarify how these latent representations are extracted, how they interface with the LLM’s architecture (e.g., through attention layers, embeddings, or prompts), and provide theoretical justification or preliminary evidence that such a neuro-inspired modulation effectively influences generation quality, bias mitigation, and factuality in a robust manner. Without precise mechanism descriptions, replicability and overall soundness are compromised, risking this framework becoming a high-level metaphor rather than a functional system. Enhancing this section with concrete algorithmic details, architectural diagrams, or preliminary ablation studies is essential to demonstrate feasibility and soundness of the core contribution at this stage."

          "feedback_content": "While the stepwise experiment plan thoughtfully progresses from dataset compilation to evaluation, it currently omits crucial details on the validation and operationalization of the psychological validity indicators and simulated latent states. Specifically, the plan should include clear protocols or benchmarks for how functional neuroimaging-inspired latent state tracking can be reliably simulated and validated against actual neurocognitive phenomena. Furthermore, the integration of bias scores and factuality drift metrics needs rigorous definition with statistical methods and thresholds for significance. Consider adding pilot studies or controlled experiments isolating the neuro-adaptive component's effect, along with scalability and computational resource assessments. Without these, the feasibility of empirically demonstrating improvements over static RAG baselines remains uncertain. Strengthening the experimental rigor and clarity will materially increase confidence in the practicability and reproducibility of results."
