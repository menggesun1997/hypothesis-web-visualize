    "title": "Neuromorphic Memory Consolidation Modules for Long-Term Knowledge Stabilization in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM continual learning systems lack efficient mechanisms to consolidate short-term plastic changes into stable long-term memory representations inspired by biological sleep and neuromodulation processes, causing knowledge instability.",
    "Motivation": "Targets external critical gap on neuromorphic event-driven architectures; proposes a biologically inspired memory consolidation module for LLMs to reconcile plasticity-stability dynamics leveraging spike-based replay-like mechanisms in offline phases, a novel contribution in language model continual adaptation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Integrate a neuromorphic-inspired offline consolidation module that replays spike-driven patterns internally generated via hippocampus-like recurrent spiking circuits interfaced with the LLM transformer layers. This module selects recent incremental knowledge changes and consolidates them into stable transformer parameters during low-activity phases mimicking biological sleep processes. Plasticity is regulated via neuromodulatory-inspired gating signals controlling synaptic updates. The approach aims to reduce catastrophic forgetting while maintaining online adaptability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct hybrid transformer-spiking replay module. 2) Train on continual update benchmarks with defined online/offline phases. 3) Baselines: continual learning without consolidation. 4) Metrics: forgetting mitigation, stability-plasticity trade-off, consolidation latency. 5) Analyze impact of neuromodulatory gating on update stability. 6) Explore energy and temporal efficiency of consolidation steps.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Nightly incremental updates of evolving news facts; Output: Model retains all previous world knowledge coherently after daily consolidation phases, demonstrating reduced forgetting compared to online-only updates.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If replay-based consolidation is too resource intensive, explore gradient-based consolidation penalties or momentum updates resembling offline stabilization without spike-based replay."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed neuromorphic-inspired offline consolidation module leveraging hippocampus-like recurrent spiking circuits interfacing with transformer layers is highly innovative, the mechanism lacks sufficient technical detail and clarity about integration specifics. Key issues include: how exactly spike-driven replay patterns translate into parameter updates in standard transformer architectures, how neuromodulatory gating signals are quantitatively modeled and controlled, and what precise synaptic update rules govern the plasticity-stability regulation. These details are crucial to assess the biological plausibility and computational coherence of the method. Providing a more concrete algorithmic framework or mathematical formulation would improve soundness significantly beyond conceptual analogy alone, enabling clearer replication and validation pathways in experiments. This clarity would also clarify assumptions and help set realistic expectations for performance gains and resource requirements, especially given the hybrid spiking-transformer setup complexity that is not standard in language model continual learning today. Addressing this will reduce theoretical ambiguity and strengthen the proposalâ€™s foundational rigour, elevating confidence that the neuromorphic consolidation strategy can deliver on its claims of stability and adaptability balance for LLMs in continual learning contexts.\n\nActionable suggestion: Add detailed pseudocode or a schematic illustrating the data flow, spike replay mechanism, gating control, and parameter update steps. Provide specific update rules or equations inspired by neuromodulatory neurobiology but adapted to transformer parameters. Clarify offline phase scheduling and how low activity phases are triggered and utilized in practice."

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan is generally well-structured but overly idealized regarding feasibility of constructing and training a hybrid transformer and spiking replay module: both in computational cost and software ecosystem maturity. Key practical challenges include implementing biologically inspired recurrent spiking circuits efficiently within or alongside transformer architectures at scale, and defining meaningful offline phases analogous to biological sleep within standard continual learning benchmarks. \n\nMoreover, assessing energy and temporal efficiency (Step 6) before initial validation of learning stability might dilute focus. The evaluation metrics could better reflect typical continual learning challenges and be expanded to include scalability, generalization to different language domains, and comparisons to more recent continual learning baselines beyond replay-free methods. \n\nActionable suggestion: Add fallback or simplification experiments early on that rely on approximated spike replay (e.g., event-driven representations computed offline but without full spiking simulation) to validate the consolidation concept before full neuromorphic implementation. Define concrete benchmarks and datasets with clearly defined online/offline phase splits. Clarify how to measure neuromodulatory impact quantitatively, potentially via ablation or gating signal manipulation experiments. Prioritize initial focus on accuracy and forgetting metrics before energy/time efficiency analysis."
