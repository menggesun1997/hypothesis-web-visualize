    "title": "Human Resource Integration for Societal Impact Bias Assessment",
    "Problem_Statement": "AI fairness research in LLM moderation insufficiently integrates human resource management and societal impact perspectives, limiting ethical deployment awareness in organizational contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external gap around human resource management and societal impact connection, proposing culturally aware, organizational-level bias auditing frameworks that reflect workforce dynamics and community norms.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a framework combining LLM-generated content moderation audit reports with human resource impact assessments. The system simulates organizational social dynamics, evaluates AI bias impact on diverse workforce groups, and suggests moderation adjustments respecting human resource policies and social equity.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate datasets mapping content moderation outcomes to workforce demographic effects. 2) Build simulation modules for organizational impact. 3) Validate with HR experts and test on case studies involving moderated social media channels. 4) Measure improvements in societal impact fairness metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Moderation decisions affecting employee online discussions. Expected output: model recommendations balancing content safety with inclusivity per HR diversity guidelines.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If organizational simulation is too abstract, fallback to survey-based human-in-the-loop evaluations and iterative refinement anchored in qualitative data."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while well-structured, faces significant challenges in data availability and validation rigor. In particular, curating datasets that map content moderation outcomes directly to workforce demographic effects is non-trivial and may suffer from data sparsity and privacy constraints. The simulation modules for organizational impact need clear theoretical underpinnings and validated behavioral models of social dynamics within diverse workforce contexts to ensure meaningful outputs, which the current plan lacks. Validation solely by HR experts and case studies on moderated social media channels may not sufficiently cover the complexities of organizational interactions or allow quantitative benchmarking. To enhance feasibility, the plan should explicitly include concrete data collection strategies, detailed modeling assumptions for simulations, and incorporate mixed-method evaluations combining quantitative metrics with qualitative insights from varied organizational stakeholders, beyond just HR experts. This will strengthen scientific soundness and practicability of experiments in a complex socio-technical setting. Suggested amendment in Experiment_Plan is essential before advancing to implementation stages. Target_section: Experiment_Plan. [FEA-EXPERIMENT]."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty rating as NOV-COMPETITIVE, the idea would benefit significantly from explicitly integrating concepts like 'model risk management' and 'ethical decision-making' at the corporate governance level to broaden impact and novelty. For example, the framework could be extended to support corporate board members or corporate governance bodies in assessing model risks and aligning content moderation policies with stakeholder protection and civic engagement goals. This would create a more holistic socio-technical ecosystem that links technical bias assessment with organizational risk oversight and ethical frameworks, enhancing both the scientific and practical relevance. Embedding these globally-linked concepts could transform the framework from an organizational HR tool to a strategic asset in ethical AI governance, boosting impact and novelty.
