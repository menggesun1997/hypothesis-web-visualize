        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs inadequately synthesize and verify encyclopedic world knowledge, suffering from low interpretability and reliability in open-domain QA, especially when relying on fragmented, domain-specific data.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal critical gap of limitations in synthesis and verification of encyclopedic knowledge by integrating discourse analysis and literary historicity, leveraging hidden bridges between AI and humanities to develop a robust, semantically anchored encoding.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a semantic anchoring framework combining transformer-based LLMs with modules trained on discourse analytic and literary datasets to capture textual historicity, narrative structures, and pragmatic context. This fusion will generate enriched semantic embeddings guiding the LLM’s encyclopedic knowledge representation, forcing cross-validation via humanities-informed constraints.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble datasets comprising open-domain QA benchmarks, literary corpora with annotated discourse features, and encyclopedic knowledge bases. 2) Implement baseline LLMs fine-tuned with standard methods. 3) Integrate a semantic anchoring module trained via multi-task learning on discourse/literary tasks and encyclopedic QA. 4) Evaluate semantic accuracy with novel metrics incorporating discourse coherence and factuality. 5) Conduct human expert evaluation from linguistics and AI domains.",
