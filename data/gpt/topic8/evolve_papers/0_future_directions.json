        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs inadequately synthesize and verify encyclopedic world knowledge, suffering from low interpretability and reliability in open-domain QA, especially when relying on fragmented, domain-specific data.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal critical gap of limitations in synthesis and verification of encyclopedic knowledge by integrating discourse analysis and literary historicity, leveraging hidden bridges between AI and humanities to develop a robust, semantically anchored encoding.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a semantic anchoring framework combining transformer-based LLMs with modules trained on discourse analytic and literary datasets to capture textual historicity, narrative structures, and pragmatic context. This fusion will generate enriched semantic embeddings guiding the LLMâ€™s encyclopedic knowledge representation, forcing cross-validation via humanities-informed constraints.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble datasets comprising open-domain QA benchmarks, literary corpora with annotated discourse features, and encyclopedic knowledge bases. 2) Implement baseline LLMs fine-tuned with standard methods. 3) Integrate a semantic anchoring module trained via multi-task learning on discourse/literary tasks and encyclopedic QA. 4) Evaluate semantic accuracy with novel metrics incorporating discourse coherence and factuality. 5) Conduct human expert evaluation from linguistics and AI domains.",
