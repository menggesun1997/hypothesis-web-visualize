    "title": "Cognitive-Semantic Clustering for Commonsense in HRI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLMs integrated into human-robot interaction (HRI) lack adequate grounding in commonsense knowledge that reflects human cognitive semantic activation, resulting in suboptimal explainability and collaboration effectiveness.",
    "Motivation": "This project addresses the internal gap of insufficient semantic grounding in LLMs for HRI by leveraging the critical gap on lack of cognitive-inspired commonsense frameworks. It exploits the high-potential innovation opportunity to develop hybrid cognitive-statistical frameworks that integrate semantic activation patterns with robust clustering methods for interpretation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid framework combining cognitive semantic network activation models with high-probability statistical clustering algorithms to analyze and explain LLM decisions in HRI contexts. The method constructs semantic networks inspired by cognitive psychology to represent commonsense knowledge and uses clustering methods (mean shift, quick shift) to robustly identify decision patterns with statistical guarantees. Explanations are generated by linking clusters with cognitive semantic activations highlighting the rationale behind LLM outputs in an interpretable manner.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble a multimodal HRI dataset including dialogue transcripts, robot sensor data, and user feedback.\n2) Implement baseline LLMs with existing commonsense integration.\n3) Develop the cognitive-semantic network construction module representing commonsense concepts.\n4) Apply clustering (mean shift, quick shift) integrating semantic activations on model internal states/representations.\n5) Measure explanation quality using human subject studies and automatic transparency metrics.\n6) Compare robustness under uncertainty with model-agnostic explanation baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A robot assistant responds to a human saying 'Bring me something to drink because I am thirsty.'\nExpected output: The system clusters the LLM output patterns tied to commonsense semantic concepts like 'thirst' and 'drink' and explains that the robot decided to fetch a beverage due to activated concepts related to thirst in its semantic network, demonstrating contextual commonsense understanding.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If clustering semantic activations does not yield meaningful patterns, alternative dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-SNE combined with attention visualization will be explored. Additionally, we will evaluate incorporating pretrained cognitive semantic embeddings or symbolic knowledge graphs for enhanced grounding."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an innovative hybrid framework combining cognitive semantic activation models with clustering algorithms. However, the mechanism by which semantic activations derived from cognitive models interface quantitatively and procedurally with the clustering methods (mean shift, quick shift) is not clearly specified. For instance, how are the semantic activations operationalized numerically for clustering? Moreover, details on how clustering outputs concretely generate interpretable explanations linked back to cognitive semantics are missing. Clarifying the end-to-end pipeline with precise algorithmic steps, data representations, and rationale for chosen clustering methods would greatly enhance soundness and reproducibility of the approach. Consider including a schematic or pseudo-code to illustrate these interactions explicitly in the paper's Proposed_Method section, to convincingly demonstrate the novelty and feasibility of the integration approach in HRI contexts (e.g., linking latent LLM states, semantic network activations, and cluster assignments). This will also address potential skepticism about the cognitive-statistical hybrid strategy's practical operability and explanatory power in a complex multimodal setting such as HRI environments requiring commonsense understanding and explainability.  \n\nFurthermore, clarify how noisy or high-dimensional internal LLM states will be managed to maintain clustering robustness and interpretability, or whether dimensionality reduction and feature selection are integral parts of the method rather than fallback options. Strengthening these theoretical and methodological details is essential for the idea's soundness and reviewer confidence in technical rigor and innovation impact."

However, the current experimental plan lacks sufficient operational and methodological details that affect feasibility and validity:\n\n- The plan does not specify the criteria or standards for multimodal dataset selection or creation. Given the novelty and interdisciplinary nature, clear benchmark datasets or dataset properties (size, diversity, annotation strategy) must be identified to ensure reproducibility and comparability.\n\n- The implementation specifics of the cognitive-semantic network (e.g., sources of commonsense concepts, semantic relations, pruning criteria) are unclear, which impacts preparation feasibility.\n\n- The human subject study design for assessing explanation quality requires elaboration â€” details about participant demographics, evaluation metrics, control conditions, and statistical power considerations should be included.\n\n- The plan should consider integrating quantitative automatic explanation metrics earlier in the development cycle to enable iterative refinement before costly human studies.\n\n- The fallback plan mentions alternative dimensionality reduction and embeddings but lacks contingency triggers or criteria for switching strategies in practice.\n\nEnhancing the experimental plan with concrete dataset examples, detailed cognitive-semantic network engineering steps, clear evaluation protocols for human and automatic benchmarks, and explicit milestones with success criteria will improve its scientific rigor and operational feasibility to convince reviewers and stakeholders of practical viability."
