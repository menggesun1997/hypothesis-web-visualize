    "title": "Neuro-Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Dynamic Knowledge Assimilation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods rely on static evaluation protocols that inadequately capture the dynamic evolution of LLMs' knowledge as they interact with continually updated world information. This represents a challenge for accurately assessing and improving factuality and bias mitigation in real-time knowledge acquisition.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap of over-reliance on static and retrospective methods and aims to operationalize the high-potential opportunity of cognitive neuroscience-inspired evaluation frameworks by integrating temporal dynamics and psychological constructs into RAG evaluation protocols.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a neuro-adaptive framework leveraging simulated ecological momentary assessment (EMA) paradigms aligned with functional neuroimaging-inspired latent state tracking to monitor LLM internal states during retrieval interaction. The architecture encodes retrieval queries and sources into psychologically interpretable latent features modeled after medial prefrontal cortex activity patterns related to self-perception. These latent features modulate the LLM's generation process dynamically to reflect updated world knowledge and evolving bias profiles, with online bias measurement and correction loops.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compile a temporal knowledge-update dataset simulating real-world news and fact changes. 2) Implement baseline LLMs with standard RAG pipelines. 3) Integrate the proposed latent state tracking using transformer-based encodings simulating neural activation patterns. 4) Develop an evaluation metric suite combining traditional NLP benchmarks with psychological validity indicators (e.g., bias scores over time, factuality drift). 5) Run experiments comparing static versus neuro-adaptive RAG on datasets. 6) Analyze results for improvement in dynamic factuality retention and bias stabilization.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What is the current status of Mars colonization efforts as of today?\" with retrieval indexing including recent discoveries and mission updates. Output: An answer referencing the latest rover missions, incorporating retrieval-augmented data, with confidence and bias assessments indicating temporal knowledge consistency and minimized hallucinations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If neuro-inspired latent features fail to improve evaluation sensitivity, pivot to integrating psychometric personality trait embeddings directly into retrieval query scoring to modulate source trustworthiness, combined with user feedback loops for incremental improvement."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed neuro-adaptive framework intriguingly maps retrieval queries and sources to psychologically interpretable latent features modeled after medial prefrontal cortex activity. However, the mechanism for how these biologically inspired latent states concretely integrate with and modulate the LLM’s generation process lacks clarity and technical detail. The submission should explicitly clarify how these latent representations are extracted, how they interface with the LLM’s architecture (e.g., through attention layers, embeddings, or prompts), and provide theoretical justification or preliminary evidence that such a neuro-inspired modulation effectively influences generation quality, bias mitigation, and factuality in a robust manner. Without precise mechanism descriptions, replicability and overall soundness are compromised, risking this framework becoming a high-level metaphor rather than a functional system. Enhancing this section with concrete algorithmic details, architectural diagrams, or preliminary ablation studies is essential to demonstrate feasibility and soundness of the core contribution at this stage."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "While the stepwise experiment plan thoughtfully progresses from dataset compilation to evaluation, it currently omits crucial details on the validation and operationalization of the psychological validity indicators and simulated latent states. Specifically, the plan should include clear protocols or benchmarks for how functional neuroimaging-inspired latent state tracking can be reliably simulated and validated against actual neurocognitive phenomena. Furthermore, the integration of bias scores and factuality drift metrics needs rigorous definition with statistical methods and thresholds for significance. Consider adding pilot studies or controlled experiments isolating the neuro-adaptive component's effect, along with scalability and computational resource assessments. Without these, the feasibility of empirically demonstrating improvements over static RAG baselines remains uncertain. Strengthening the experimental rigor and clarity will materially increase confidence in the practicability and reproducibility of results."
