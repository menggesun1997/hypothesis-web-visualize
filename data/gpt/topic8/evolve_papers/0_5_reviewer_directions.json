    "title": "Ethics-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Knowledge Representation in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Ethical, legal, and social issues in LLM-generated encyclopedic knowledge are not systematically incorporated into the model's learning processes, risking irresponsible content generation.",
    "Motivation": "By integrating ethical frameworks drawn from multidisciplinary domains into DRL-based LLM training pipelines, this approach fills the gap on embedding ethics deeply and systematically within knowledge representation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an ethics-aware reinforcement learning framework where reward functions include ethical compliance scores derived from occupational safety, health standards, and social norms corpora. The model learns to balance factual accuracy with ethical acceptability during open-domain QA generation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct multi-domain ethical compliance datasets and scoring functions. 2) Implement reward shaping for RL fine-tuning of LLMs. 3) Run comparative experiments with and without ethical rewards on open-domain QA tasks. 4) Measure impact on both answer quality and ethical adherence using human and automated evaluators.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Describe the use of AI in workplace safety monitoring.' Expected Output: An answer combining technical information with ethical implications considering privacy, consent, and safety regulations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If reward shaping destabilizes learning, use a multi-objective optimization approach or separate ethical content filters post-generation."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that ethical compliance can be effectively quantified as reward signals by aggregating diverse ethical standards (occupational safety, health, social norms). However, these domains often have conflicting or context-dependent rules, which might make a single reward function insufficiently expressive or introduce ambiguity. The proposal should clarify how ethical conflicts, contextual nuances, and cross-domain trade-offs are modeled and resolved within the reinforcement learning framework to ensure soundness of the core assumption that these can be uniformly encoded into reward shaping for LLM training without oversimplification or bias risk. This clarification is critical before proceeding with implementation to avoid misleading or inconsistent ethical behaviors by the model in complex real-world deployments, such as those illustrated by the test case on workplace safety AI usage incorporating privacy and consent concerns concurrently with factual generation. Consider explicitly integrating multi-objective or hierarchical ethical representations justifying their feasibility and theoretical grounding in the Proposed_Method section. This will bolster internal validity and mitigate potential oversights in ethical representation complexity. Target: Proposed_Method section; additionally review Problem_Statement assumptions related to ethical integration feasibility and scope complexity within LLM learning pipelines. \n\n"

        {
          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The experimental plan currently proposes assessment of ethical adherence using human and automated evaluators but lacks detail on the design of ethical compliance metrics and evaluation protocols. Given the subjective and context-sensitive nature of ethics, the plan needs more clarity on how ethical compliance will be operationalized, measured reproducibly, and validated across domains. Additionally, the fallback approach of post-generation ethical content filtering may undermine learned ethical reasoning and is not fully justified nor systematically integrated. There is also potential risk that reward shaping destabilizes RL training, but contingencies beyond employing multi-objective optimization are not elaborated. The proposal should include more rigorous experimental design elements such as cross-validation on multiple ethical datasets, calibration of reward signals, ablation studies isolating ethical reward impact, and robust statistical analysis criteria. This will enhance overall feasibility and credibility of the evaluation framework. Target: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section. \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "To address the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and enhance the proposal's impact and distinctiveness, consider integrating concepts from 'human-computer interaction' and 'AI safety' fields to develop interactive or adaptive ethics feedback loops during model training and deployment. For example, incorporating human-in-the-loop evaluation protocols or dynamic adjustment of ethical reward functions based on real-time user or domain expert feedback could increase robustness, trustworthiness, and context sensitivity. Additionally, leveraging advances in 'clinical decision support systems' or 'forensic psychiatry' ethical standards might provide rigorous domain-specific ethical frameworks that can be parametrically embedded, expanding impact beyond encyclopedic knowledge to specialized, socially sensitive applications. This global integration would not only increase methodological novelty but also practical applicability, broadening scope while reinforcing feasibility and trustworthiness.
