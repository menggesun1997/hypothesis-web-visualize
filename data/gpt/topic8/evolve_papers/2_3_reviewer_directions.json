    "title": "Latent Self-Perception Modeling for Interactive LLM Bias Evolution",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs lack continuous self-perception constructs that evolve with retrieval-augmented knowledge acquisition, limiting interpretability of bias evolution and decision-making dynamics over time in interactive settings.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to critical gaps regarding self-perception evolution and hidden bridge insights linking cognitive neuroscience with NLP to improve understanding and control of LLM internal state changes induced by RAG.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a latent self-perception representation module inspired by medial prefrontal cortex activation models. This module tracks LLM’s internal bias and knowledge state changes across dynamic interactions, visualizing and modulating bias drift as the LLM acquires new information via RAG. The module interfaces with generation layers to adapt outputs based on evolving internal self-assessment, enabling bias-aware contextual generation and debiasing strategies.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Define quantitative self-perception latent variables inspired by neuroscience literature. 2) Train models to map LLM internal activations to these variables during RAG tasks. 3) Analyze correlations with known bias and knowledge state shifts. 4) Implement modulation layers to adapt outputs based on self-perception states. 5) Benchmark on temporal bias evolution datasets and interactive dialogue tasks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input conversational history discussing socio-political topics with successive fact updates retrieved. Output: Generation shows bias reduction over turns, with the self-perception module outputting visualized bias confidence scores tracking decline of bias.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If self-perception states cannot be reliably extracted, adopt proxy metrics from sentiment analysis and topical alignment to approximate internal bias states for modulation."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan, while conceptually appropriate, lacks detailed practicality regarding how to quantitatively define and validate the latent self-perception variables inspired by neuroscience. Specifically, mapping LLM internal activations to brain-inspired self-perception constructs is under-specified and may face challenges due to abstract and indirect correspondence. Further elaboration on the exact methodology, data collection, and evaluation metrics for extracting and validating these latent states is needed to confirm feasibility and scientific rigor. Clarify the model architectures, training paradigms, and specific bias and knowledge measures to be used, as well as plans to handle noise and ambiguity in internal state interpretation during interactive RAG sessions to ensure clarity and reproducibility in the experimental pipeline. This will solidify the method’s scientific grounding and practical executability in dynamic LLM interactions with retrieval overlayed contexts, raising confidence in the proposed approach’s feasibility and reproducibility, a critical prerequisite before advancing to benchmarking and modulation steps. Consider pilot studies or simulations using proxy metrics before full neuroscience-inspired latent variable extraction to mitigate risks early on and strengthen methodology robustness and interpretability prior to full-scale deployment and evaluation rounds on temporal bias shift tasks and dialogue benchmarks described in the plan. Detailed methodological scaffolding here is crucial for the community’s trust and for guiding subsequent engineering efforts with large-scale LLMs augmented by retrieval mechanisms, ultimately leading to impactful and verifiable bias evolution tracking and control layers in real-world interactive NLP systems.  ---  Aim to elaborate and concretize experiments with specific data, model, metric, and validation design choices in this section for scientific and practical soundness of your approach’s experimental workflow. -- Consider including a detailed ablation plan and fallback behavioral analyses for self-perception states to establish reliability in varying interaction contexts as a robust feasibility foundation.  Furthermore, explicitly link how empirical results will inform module refinement and gap analyses leading to final model iterations tied to your debiasing objectives to ensure a tight scientific method loop in the workflow outlined here.  Stepwise actionable clarifications addressing these points will significantly strengthen the practical feasibility and clarity of the proposed experimental plan and overall approach evaluation pipeline before advancing into complex multi-turn interactive benchmarks iterations overall carefully managing experimental risk and verification complexity limitations inherent in neuroscience-ML cross-domain conceptual transfers applied to LLM latent states under RAG control schematic envisioned as the method’s core innovation and challenge area potentially requiring iterative design and testing cycles as acknowledged by fallback plans."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the interdisciplinary yet competitive nature of the topic, consider integrating concepts from psychological theories and model co-evolution frameworks within multi-agent systems to broaden the impact and originality of your work. Specifically, incorporating multi-agent perspectives wherein multiple LLM agents with evolving self-perception modules interact and adapt collaboratively or competitively could reveal deeper insights about bias dynamics and self-assessment accuracy over time. Furthermore, leveraging advances from large-scale retrieval systems and multimodal retrieval could expand the retrieval-augmented generation to cross-modal self-perception inputs, improving robustness and generalization of bias evolution modeling. This global integration may align your research more closely with real-world deployments and artificial general intelligence paradigms, enhancing practical relevance and foundational significance. Such extensions can differentiate your approach from existing work by positioning it within broader cognitive and social adaptive systems while capitalizing on current strengths in retrieval-augmented LLMs. Concrete action steps might include designing experiments and representations that explicitly model interaction and co-evolution across multiple agents with latent self-perception states, exploring psychological constructs such as self-awareness, theory of mind, and social cognition analogs to inform module design, and evaluating performance in complex cooperative or adversarial dialogue scenarios with evolving multi-agent bias dynamics. These expansions could also facilitate novel debiasing strategies stemming from emergent multi-agent behavior insights and provide richer interpretability and control frameworks for practical interactive NLP applications."
