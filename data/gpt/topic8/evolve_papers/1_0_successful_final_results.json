    "title": "Cognitive-Semantic Clustering for Commonsense in HRI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLMs integrated into human-robot interaction (HRI) lack adequate grounding in commonsense knowledge that reflects human cognitive semantic activation, resulting in suboptimal explainability and collaboration effectiveness.",
    "Motivation": "This project addresses the internal gap of insufficient semantic grounding in LLMs for HRI by leveraging the critical gap on lack of cognitive-inspired commonsense frameworks. It exploits the high-potential innovation opportunity to develop hybrid cognitive-statistical frameworks that integrate semantic activation patterns with robust clustering methods for interpretation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid framework combining cognitive semantic network activation models with high-probability statistical clustering algorithms to analyze and explain LLM decisions in HRI contexts. The method constructs semantic networks inspired by cognitive psychology to represent commonsense knowledge and uses clustering methods (mean shift, quick shift) to robustly identify decision patterns with statistical guarantees. Explanations are generated by linking clusters with cognitive semantic activations highlighting the rationale behind LLM outputs in an interpretable manner.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble a multimodal HRI dataset including dialogue transcripts, robot sensor data, and user feedback.\n2) Implement baseline LLMs with existing commonsense integration.\n3) Develop the cognitive-semantic network construction module representing commonsense concepts.\n4) Apply clustering (mean shift, quick shift) integrating semantic activations on model internal states/representations.\n5) Measure explanation quality using human subject studies and automatic transparency metrics.\n6) Compare robustness under uncertainty with model-agnostic explanation baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A robot assistant responds to a human saying 'Bring me something to drink because I am thirsty.'\nExpected output: The system clusters the LLM output patterns tied to commonsense semantic concepts like 'thirst' and 'drink' and explains that the robot decided to fetch a beverage due to activated concepts related to thirst in its semantic network, demonstrating contextual commonsense understanding.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If clustering semantic activations does not yield meaningful patterns, alternative dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-SNE combined with attention visualization will be explored. Additionally, we will evaluate incorporating pretrained cognitive semantic embeddings or symbolic knowledge graphs for enhanced grounding."

        "title": "Explainable Cognitive-Semantic Clustering Framework for Commonsense-Driven Human-Robot Interaction",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language models (LLMs) integrated into human-robot interaction (HRI) systems often underperform in providing grounded commonsense reasoning aligned with human cognitive semantic structures. This gap leads to limited explainability and decreased collaboration effectiveness, stemming from insufficient modeling of semantic activation patterns reflective of human cognitive traits within interactive, multimodal environments.",
        "Motivation": "While recent advances employ LLMs with commonsense knowledge integration, many approaches neglect deeply cognitive semantic activation patterns and their interpretable clustering for explanation in HRI. Our work innovates by explicitly quantifying and clustering cognitive-inspired semantic activations embedded in LLM internal states, yielding interpretable, cognitively grounded explanations that surpass existing black-box or symbolic-only frameworks. By harmonizing cognitive semantic networks with cutting-edge clustering and graph neural network transformation techniques, we push forward the next generation of AI in explainable HRI, addressing complexity, multimodal data, and human cognitive language structure.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a rigorously specified hybrid framework that fuses semantic memory networks inspired by human cognitive traits with advanced clustering and graph transformation methods to interpret latent LLM states in HRI contexts. \n\n1. Cognitive-Semantic Network Construction: We derive a commonsense semantic network from curated resources like ConceptNet and ATOMIC, pruning and weighting relations using semantic similarity scores computed via deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based embeddings fine-tuned on human language structure datasets. This network represents nodes/concepts and weighted edges capturing nuanced semantic relations mirroring human semantic memory.\n\n2. Semantic Activation Vector Extraction: For each LLM inference in HRI, internal latent representations linked to input multimodal stimuli (e.g., dialogue tokens, sensor data) are mapped onto the cognitive-semantic network by projecting embeddings using graph neural network (GNN) transformation layers. This yields high-dimensional semantic activation vectors representing the dynamic activation levels of semantic concepts.\n\n3. Dimensionality Reduction & Feature Selection: Given the high dimensionality and noise of latent states, we integrate t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) combined with an attention-driven feature selection module that prioritizes semantic concepts relevant to the HRI task context, ensuring robustness and interpretability.\n\n4. Clustering Mechanism: We employ density-based clustering algorithms (mean shift preferred for its ability to discover arbitrary cluster shapes without preset cluster counts) applied on the reduced semantic activation space. Clusters represent semantically coherent activation patterns that reflect the system's commonsense-driven decision modes.\n\n5. Explanation Generation: Each cluster's centroid and constituent semantic concepts are linked back explicitly to cognitive semantic network nodes and edges, facilitating human-interpretable explanations grounded in known semantic relations. Explanation templates articulate how activated concepts (e.g., 'thirst', 'drink') collectively informed the robot's action choice.\n\n6. Pipeline Overview: Input multimodal data → LLM internal state extraction → GNN-based semantic projection → attention-guided feature selection → t-SNE dimensionality reduction → mean shift clustering → cognitive-semantic mapping → explanation synthesis.\n\nWe provide detailed pseudo-code and schematic diagrams illustrating data flow and algorithmic integration for reproducibility and clarity. This framework uniquely combines cognitive semantic memory modeling, graph neural transformations, and advanced clustering to achieve interpretable commonsense explanations with rigor and novelty.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Assembly: Select and curate benchmark multimodal HRI datasets such as the Social-IQ dataset (with annotations of social commonsense dialogue), extended with robot sensor streams and explicit user intent annotations, ensuring diversity (~1000 interactions), multimodality, and human commonsense relevance.\n\n2) Baseline Implementation: Implement LLMs enhanced with current commonsense knowledge integration techniques (e.g., COMET-based symbolic explanations) for comparative baselines.\n\n3) Cognitive-Semantic Network Engineering: Build the semantic network integrating ConceptNet, ATOMIC, and semantic similarity pruning via pretrained deep CNN language models (e.g., BERT embeddings processed with convolutional layers). Set pruning thresholds to retain top 20% strongest edges; document methodology.\n\n4) Semantic Activation Extraction: Develop GNN module (e.g., Graph Convolutional Network) for projecting LLM internal states to semantic network activations; validate projection quality via semantic coherence metrics.\n\n5) Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering: Incorporate attention-based feature selection modules guided by task context embeddings; apply t-SNE followed by mean shift clustering; compare with quick shift and DBSCAN variants. Define quantitative cluster validity indices (Davies-Bouldin, Silhouette scores) for evaluation.\n\n6) Explanation Evaluation - Automatic Metrics: Integrate early-stage lexical similarity metrics (BLEU, ROUGE), faithfulness, and comprehensibility scoring using pretrained explainability assessment models to iterate method tuning.\n\n7) Human Subject Study: Design a controlled user study with 40-60 participants stratified by age and domain knowledge; use Likert-scale questionnaires for explanation quality, trust, and cognitive load. Include control conditions with baseline explanations. Employ power analysis to ensure statistical significance.\n\n8) Robustness Testing: Evaluate method resilience against uncertainty and noise by injecting synthetic perturbations in inputs and LLM representations; report impact on clustering stability and explanation consistency.\n\n9) Milestones & Success Criteria: Predefined milestones including semantic network quality targets, cluster validity thresholds, and human study significance levels; fallback to alternative dimensionality techniques is triggered if cluster validity scores fall below 0.5 or user trust scores below 3.5/5.\n\nAll components and datasets will be version-controlled and open-sourced for transparency.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input Scenario: A robot assistant receives the command: 'Bring me something to drink because I am thirsty.'\n\nExpected Process & Output:\n- LLM generates candidate actions and internal latent activations.\n- Semantic activation vectors map onto concepts including 'thirst', 'drink', 'beverage', and related semantic network nodes.\n- t-SNE and mean shift clustering group activations indicating prioritization of 'thirst'-related concepts.\n- Generated explanation states: 'The robot's decision to fetch a beverage arises from activation of semantic concepts associated with human thirst needs, including linked concepts such as drink and refreshment, reflecting contextual commonsense understanding based on semantic memory structures.'\n\nThis explanation is presented in natural language, referencing cognitive semantic components and supported by cluster visualization graphs for interpretability.\n\nMultiple analogous cases, e.g., 'I am cold', 'I need to charge my device,' will verify generalizability.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should clustering not produce meaningful or robust semantic groupings (e.g., cluster validity below thresholds), we will adopt alternative dimensionality reduction and interpretability strategies as primary methods, including:\n\n- Enhanced attention-driven embedding pruning paired with advanced t-SNE parameter tuning.\n- Incorporation of pretrained cognitive semantic embeddings from large cognitive modeling datasets to better ground activations.\n- Use of symbolic knowledge graph traversal algorithms combined with attention heatmaps over latent states to extract interpretable paths without clustering reliance.\n\nCriteria triggering fallback include low cluster quality metrics, poor human trust or comprehensibility scores, or lack of semantic coherence in explanations. These alternatives will be integrated in an iterative, milestone-driven development cycle allowing rigorous comparison to the primary framework and ensuring continuous advancement toward interpretable, cognitively grounded commonsense explanations in HRI."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an innovative hybrid framework combining cognitive semantic activation models with clustering algorithms. However, the mechanism by which semantic activations derived from cognitive models interface quantitatively and procedurally with the clustering methods (mean shift, quick shift) is not clearly specified. For instance, how are the semantic activations operationalized numerically for clustering? Moreover, details on how clustering outputs concretely generate interpretable explanations linked back to cognitive semantics are missing. Clarifying the end-to-end pipeline with precise algorithmic steps, data representations, and rationale for chosen clustering methods would greatly enhance soundness and reproducibility of the approach. Consider including a schematic or pseudo-code to illustrate these interactions explicitly in the paper's Proposed_Method section, to convincingly demonstrate the novelty and feasibility of the integration approach in HRI contexts (e.g., linking latent LLM states, semantic network activations, and cluster assignments). This will also address potential skepticism about the cognitive-statistical hybrid strategy's practical operability and explanatory power in a complex multimodal setting such as HRI environments requiring commonsense understanding and explainability.  \n\nFurthermore, clarify how noisy or high-dimensional internal LLM states will be managed to maintain clustering robustness and interpretability, or whether dimensionality reduction and feature selection are integral parts of the method rather than fallback options. Strengthening these theoretical and methodological details is essential for the idea's soundness and reviewer confidence in technical rigor and innovation impact."
