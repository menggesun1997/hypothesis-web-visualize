    "title": "Transparent Prompt Tuning with Ethical Context Embeddings",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current prompt tuning methods for LLMs in social media moderation lack transparency and adaptability, limiting the model's ability to align with evolving ethical norms and domain-specific requirements dynamically.",
    "Motivation": "This targets the critical internal gap of poor transparency and adaptability in prompt tuning methods, proposing a novel framework that embeds ethical context explicitly into prompt representations, facilitating traceable and modifiable model behavior over time and scenarios.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a prompt tuning architecture that augments prompts with explicit ethical context embeddings derived from codified ethical frameworks and real-time community standards. These embeddings are jointly optimized alongside model parameters, creating a transparent, modular system where ethical constraints can be updated or audited separately from the core LLM.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Encode ethical principles from frameworks like ACM Code of Ethics into vector embeddings. 2) Develop adaptive prompt tuning routines incorporating these embeddings. 3) Implement transparency tools logging prompt-embedding interactions. 4) Evaluate on social media datasets monitoring adherence to ethical norms and moderation accuracy compared to conventional prompt tuning.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Moderation prompt enhanced with ethical embedding prioritizing harm reduction. Given a borderline hate speech post, model outputs a moderation decision aligning with this ethical priority, clearly linked to the responsible embedding vector.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If embedding updates are ineffective, fallback to rule-based ethical gates layered over the LLM outputs. Explore alternative transparency mechanisms, such as attention-based interpretability methods, to highlight ethical influence on decisions."

          "feedback_content": "While the idea of embedding ethical context embeddings for transparent prompt tuning is promising, the Proposed_Method lacks clarity on how these embeddings will be derived, represented, and integrated technically at a prompt tuning level. It is unclear how codified ethical frameworks and real-time community standards, which may differ significantly in form and update frequency, can be jointly optimized with model parameters without conflicting signals or overfitting. Explicit architectural details, protocols for embedding updates, and mechanisms to ensure modularity and traceability are needed to substantiate the core claim of transparency and adaptability reliably functioning in practice. Providing a more rigorous algorithmic description or preliminary proof of concept would strengthen the method's soundness substantially. This will help reviewers and practitioners assess the validity of the assumptions and the feasibility of the approach beyond high-level motivation and conceptual framing. Please augment the Proposed_Method section accordingly with detailed mechanisms and possibly theoretical analysis or justification if available.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the focus on ethical embeddings in prompt tuning for social media moderation, incorporating concepts from 'human-in-the-loop systems' could significantly bolster both impact and feasibility. By actively integrating human moderator feedback into the updating process of ethical context embeddings, the system could dynamically learn evolving community norms and ethical interpretations, addressing practical challenges of adaptability and traceability. Additionally, leveraging 'platform integration' for real-time data and moderator inputs would ground ethical updates in operational realities. This fusion can move the idea beyond a static embedding approach towards a participatory, continuously improving system that better aligns with social media's dynamic environmentâ€”thereby enhancing both novelty and practical impact. Consider expanding experiment plans and system designs to explicitly incorporate human-in-the-loop mechanisms and platform integration aspects to realize this potential."
