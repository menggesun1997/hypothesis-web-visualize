        "title": "Graph-Guided Semantic Stability in Continual LLM Updates",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models updating world knowledge increasingly suffer from forgetting previously learned useful information, especially when no stored data is used for rehearsal. The inability to leverage the semantic and hierarchical structure of world knowledge prevents efficient retention and integration of new information without degradation.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses internal critical gap (3) concerning bias in incremental classifiers and insufficient use of semantic/hierarchical knowledge structures for reducing forgetting. Builds on high-potential innovation opportunity (1) by embedding graph convolutional networks in continual learning for LLMs to improve stability-plasticity balance via structured knowledge representation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a continual learning framework for LLMs that overlays a semantic knowledge graph representing entity relationships relevant to the model’s domain. Employ graph convolutional networks (GCNs) or graph transformers to encode hierarchical knowledge features that inform incremental parameter updates. This graph-guided regularization constrains learning to preserve critical semantic relationships. The system dynamically updates the graph with new entities/concepts as knowledge evolves, integrating graph-based embeddings into transformer layers through specialized adapters facilitating efficient forward-only updates without accessing prior data.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Benchmark on continual knowledge update tasks (e.g., temporal QA datasets). 2) Use baseline LLM continual learning frameworks (rehearsal-free) for comparison. 3) Evaluate with/without graph-guided stabilization layer.  4) Metrics: forgetting rate, forward transfer, knowledge update accuracy, semantic consistency (graph alignment). 5) Ablate parts of graph architecture to assess contribution. 6) Test scalability across hierarchical depths and knowledge domains.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"As of 2024, what is the capital of the newly formed country X?\" Output: Correct capital named; prior knowledge about country Y not degraded (stability); semantic graph relationships ensure entity X linked correctly in knowledge base to prevent confusion with similar entities.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If graph integration proves unstable, fallback to simplified knowledge embedding with hierarchical clustering features to approximate semantic structure. Alternatively, use knowledge distillation from graph-enhanced teacher models to student LLMs to imprint semantic consistency without explicit graph convolutions."

Incorporate differential privacy mechanisms and federated incremental updates, allowing LLMs to adapt on diverse decentralized data sources without raw data replay. The framework includes knowledge projection layers that reconcile updates with legacy knowledge, reducing bias and forgetting, and automatically prioritize incoming updates based on importance and relevance metrics aligned with data stewardship policies.",

Knowledge updates trigger event-driven adaptations localized via synaptic eligibility traces, enabling fast, low-energy incremental learning without global gradient backpropagation. Combine classical analog transformer layers with spiking modules for core language modeling, and neuromorphic modules for continual knowledge update embedding, allowing asynchronous, energy-efficient updates with minimal forgetting.",
