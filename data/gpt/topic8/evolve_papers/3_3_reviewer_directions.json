    "title": "Hierarchical Graph Transformers for Semantic Regularization in Continual LLM Training",
    "Problem_Statement": "Incremental classifiers in LLM continual learning show biases due to inadequate modeling of multi-level semantic structures, limiting generalizability and causing forgetting.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gap (3); proposes novel hierarchical graph transformer layers integrated into LLMs to explicitly model semantic hierarchies during incremental updates, expanding innovation opportunity (1) with emphasis on hierarchy over flat graphs, a significant extension to current graph-based methods.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a hierarchical graph transformer module that constructs multi-level semantic graphs from knowledge base ontologies and integrates them into LLM hidden states during continual updates. This module attends over graph nodes at different abstraction levels, regularizing parameter updates to respect semantic inheritance and relationships. The framework includes a dynamic graph refinement process that adapts hierarchy granularity based on update complexity, constraining the model to learn incremental knowledge while maintaining alignment with semantic hierarchies to reduce forgetting and bias.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Use Semantic Web ontologies (e.g., WordNet, Wikidata) to build hierarchical graphs for language knowledge. 2) Apply continual learning tasks with domain expansions (e.g., new scientific fields). 3) Baseline: LLM incremental learning without hierarchical regularization. 4) Metrics: incremental task accuracy, knowledge retention, bias evaluation, semantic coherence. 5) Conduct hierarchical ablation studies and graph granularity experiments.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Query about a newly introduced subcategory of animals; Output: Correct response that respects ancestral taxonomic relations, demonstrating minimal interference with existing knowledge of broader categories.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If hierarchical graphs prove difficult to integrate at scale, reduce to two-level coarse semantic groupings or incorporate hierarchy via multitask auxiliary losses instead of direct graph attention mechanisms."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a hierarchical graph transformer module integrating semantic hierarchies into LLM hidden states for continual learning. However, the mechanism by which the hierarchical graph attention operates over multi-level nodes and how it concretely regularizes parameter updates requires stronger technical clarity. Specifically, it is unclear how semantic inheritance and relationships quantitatively influence the update process and mitigate forgetting and bias. Detailing the module architecture, the attention computation over graph levels, interaction with LLM representations, and how dynamic graph refinement is operationalized would greatly strengthen soundness and reproducibility prospects. This explicit mechanistic grounding is critical because current notions risk ambiguity which may hinder implementation and evaluation fidelity. Consider formal mathematical descriptions or algorithmic pseudocode to clarify these steps in the Proposed_Method section. This will also assist in differentiating from related graph-based approaches more concretely rather than relying primarily on conceptual novelty of hierarchy over flat graphs alone, particularly given the competitive novelty space identified in the initial assessment stage. Enhancing this clarity will support feasibility and impact downstream, as replicability and precise hypotheses facilitate better experimental validation and community uptake later on.  Targeted clarification here is essential before progressing, to prevent fundamental conceptual gaps from propagating into experiments and impact evaluation stages.  \n\n"

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a sound and reasonable approach to evaluating the proposed hierarchical graph transformer for continual learning, including relevant baselines and metrics. Yet, its feasibility at scale and integration complexity deserve deeper consideration. For instance, several Semantic Web ontologies like WordNet are large and hierarchically deep—practical integration of such graphs into large language models via graph attention could be computationally expensive with unclear training dynamics. There is a risk of scalability bottlenecks or unstable training arising from dynamic graph refinement, which may not be fully assessed in the outlined experiments. Furthermore, the fallback plan reduces hierarchy granularity or shifts to multitask losses but the criteria for transitioning between plans and quantifying integration difficulty require elaboration. I recommend more concrete milestones or quantitative indicators to monitor integration challenges—such as memory consumption, convergence profiles under varying graph granularities or update complexities—to ensure empirical feasibility is assessed fully rather than relying on qualitative fallback steps alone. Adding small-scale pilot experiments as an initial step focusing solely on computational performance and integration overhead can improve realism of the experiment plan. Only once these integration and scalability factors are well characterized should larger continual learning task expansions proceed. Clarifying these experimental design and feasibility checkpoints will enhance confidence in the practical realization of the idea and support its incremental validation as stated.  \n\n"
