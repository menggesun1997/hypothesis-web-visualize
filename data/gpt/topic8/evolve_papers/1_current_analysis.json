In this\\xa0rapidly evolving field, large number of methods are being reported using machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. Majority of these models are\\xa0inherently complex and lacks explanations\\xa0of the decision making process\\xa0causing these models to be termed as 'Black-Box'. One of the major bottlenecks to adopt such models in mission-critical application domains, such as\\xa0banking, e-commerce, healthcare, and public services and\\xa0safety, is the difficulty in\\xa0interpreting them. Due to the rapid proleferation of these AI models, explaining their learning and decision making process are\\xa0getting harder which require\\xa0transparency\\xa0and easy predictability.\\xa0Aiming to collate the current state-of-the-art in interpreting the black-box models,\\xa0this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the\\xa0explainable AI (XAI)\\xa0models. To reduce\\xa0false negative and false positive outcomes of these back-box models,\\xa0finding flaws in them\\xa0is still difficult and inefficient.

We propose an algorithm to efficiently compute these explanations for any black-box model with high-probability guarantees. We demonstrate the flexibility of anchors by explaining a myriad of different models for different domains and tasks. In a user study, we show that anchors enable users to predict how a model would behave on unseen instances with less effort and higher precision, as compared to existing linear explanations or no explanations.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Quick Shift and Kernel Methods for Mode Seeking', 'abstract': 'We show that the complexity of the recently introduced medoid-shift algorithm in clustering N points is O(N2), with a small constant, if the underlying distance is Euclidean. This makes medoid shift considerably faster than mean shift, contrarily to what previously believed. We then exploit kernel methods to extend both mean shift and the improved medoid shift to a large family of distances, with complexity bounded by the effective rank of the resulting kernel matrix, and with explicit regularization constraints. Finally, we show that, under certain conditions, medoid shift fails to cluster data points belonging to the same mode, resulting in over-fragmentation. We propose remedies for this problem, by introducing a novel, simple and extremely efficient clustering algorithm, called quick shift, that explicitly trades off under- and over-fragmentation. Like medoid shift, quick shift operates in non-Euclidean spaces in a straightforward manner. We also show that the accelerated medoid shift can be used to initialize mean shift for increased efficiency. We illustrate our algorithms to clustering data on manifolds, image segmentation, and the automatic discovery of visual categories.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Mean shift: a robust approach toward feature space analysis', 'abstract': 'A general non-parametric technique is proposed for the analysis of a complex multimodal feature space and to delineate arbitrarily shaped clusters in it. The basic computational module of the technique is an old pattern recognition procedure: the mean shift. For discrete data, we prove the convergence of a recursive mean shift procedure to the nearest stationary point of the underlying density function and, thus, its utility in detecting the modes of the density. The relation of the mean shift procedure to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators; of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks discontinuity-preserving smoothing and image segmentation - are described as applications. In these algorithms, the only user-set parameter is the resolution of the analysis, and either gray-level or color images are accepted as input.

This generalization makes some k-means like clustering algorithms its special cases. It is shown that mean shift is a mode-seeking process on the surface constructed with a \"shadow\" kernal. For Gaussian kernels, mean shift is a gradient mapping. Convergence is studied for mean shift iterations. Cluster analysis if treated as a deterministic problem of finding a fixed point of mean shift that characterizes the data. Applications in clustering and Hough transform are demonstrated. Mean shift is also considered as an evolutionary strategy that performs multistart global optimization.<>'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Submodular Function Maximization', 'abstract': 'In this chapter we will introduce submodularity and some of its generalizations, illustrate how it arises in various applications, and discuss algorithms for optimizing submodular functions. Submodularity is a property of set functions with deep theoretical consequences and far-reaching applications. At first glance it seems very similar to concavity, in other ways it resembles convexity. It appears in a wide variety of applications: in Computer Science it has recently been identified and utilized in domains such as viral marketing [39], information gathering [44], image segmentation [10, 40, 36], document summarization [56], and speeding up satisfiability solvers [73]. Our emphasis in this chapter is on maximization; there are many important results and applications related to minimizing submodular functions that we do not cover. As a concrete running example, we will consider the problem of deploying sensors in a drinking water distribution network (see Figure 3.1) in order to detect contamination. In this domain, we may have a model of how contaminants, accidentally or maliciously introduced into the network, spread over time. Such a model then allows to quantify the benefit f(A) of deploying sensors at a particular set A of locations (junctions or pipes in the network) in terms of the detection performance (such as average time to detection). Based on this notion of utility, we then wish to find an optimal subset A ⊆ V of locations maximizing the utility, maxAf(A), subject to some constraints (such as bounded cost). This application requires solving a difficult real-world optimization problem, that can be handled with the techniques discussed in this chapter (Krause et al. [49] show in detail how submodular optimization can be applied in this domain.)'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Emotion classification for short texts: an improved multi-label method', 'abstract': 'The process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text is of great importance to support better understanding and services to online users in the digital environment. However, accurate and fast multi-label automatic classification is still insufficient. By considering not only individual in-sentence features but also the features in the adjacent sentences and the full text of the tweet, this study adjusted the Multi-label K-Nearest Neighbors (MLkNN) classifier to allow iterative corrections of the multi-label emotion classification. It applies the new method to improve both the accuracy and speed of emotion classification for short texts on Twitter. By carrying out three groups of experiments on the Twitter corpus, this study compares the performance of the base classifier of MLkNN, the sample-based MLkNN (S-MLkNN), and the label-based MLkNN (L-MLkNN). The results show that the improved MLkNN algorithm can effectively improve the accuracy of emotion classification of short texts, especially when the value of K in the MLkNN base classifier is 8, and the value of α is 0.7, and the improved L-MLkNN algorithm outperforms the other methods in the overall performance and the recall rate reaches 0.8019. This study attempts to obtain an efficient classifier with smaller training samples and lower training costs for sentiment analysis. It is suggested that future studies should pay more attention to balancing the efficiency of the model with smaller training sample sizes and the completeness of the model to cover various scenarios.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'A comparative analysis of K-Nearest Neighbor, Genetic, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Long Short Term Memory algorithms in machine learning', 'abstract': 'Machine learning (ML) is a new-age thriving technology, which facilitates computers to read and interpret from the previously present data automatically.

However, one single model cannot effectively grasp the characteristics of the data and make accurate predictions because of the strong nonlinear characteristics of daily tourist flow data. Accordingly, this study predicts daily tourist flow in Huangshan Scenic Spot in China. A prediction method (GA-CNN-LSTM) which combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short-term memory network (LSTM) and optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) is established. First, network search data, meteorological data, and other data are constructed into continuous feature maps. Then, feature vectors are extracted by convolutional neural network (CNN). Finally, the feature vectors are input into long-short-term memory network (LSTM) in time series for prediction. Moreover, GA is used to scientifically select the number of neurons in the CNN-LSTM model. Data is preprocessed and normalized before prediction. The accuracy of GA-CNN-LSTM is evaluated using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), Pearson correlation coefficient and index of agreement (IA). For a fair comparison, GA-CNN-LSTM model is compared with CNN-LSTM, LSTM, CNN and the back propagation neural network (BP).

    "current_research_landscape": "The current research landscape centers around enhancing explainability and interpretability of complex AI models—particularly black-box models—using high-precision, model-agnostic explanation methods such as anchors within human-centered AI applications. Core methodologies revolve around clustering algorithms (mean shift, quick shift) and kernel methods for understanding multimodal feature spaces, underpinned by pattern recognition procedures in non-Euclidean spaces. These techniques are leveraged to discover meaningful behavioral models of complex systems, supported by high-probability statistical guarantees and validated through user studies. The integration of explainable AI (XAI) research with artificial intelligence advances supports improved transparency and trustworthiness, which are critical in domains like human-robot interaction (HRI). The thematic clusters reveal a strong focus on clustering data points and feature space analysis, rule-based high-precision explanations for model behavior, and image segmentation as an applied domain, altogether forming the backbone for interpreting LLMs’ behavior and their incorporation of commonsense knowledge in interactive systems.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps include a persistent lack of direct focus on commonsense knowledge integration in language models specifically tailored for human-robot interaction. Despite advances in clustering and explanation techniques, existing works do not sufficiently address the contextual grounding and semantic richness needed for commonsense reasoning within LLMs to support nuanced human-robot collaboration. The evolutionary trajectory reveals a reliance on statistical and clustering methods without deep incorporation of cognitive-inspired commonsense frameworks or multimodal sensorimotor data integration. Externally, the global analysis identifies overlooked opportunities at the intersection of clustering methods with high-probability guarantees and XAI research to enhance model reliability under uncertainty. Additionally, cross-disciplinary connections linking pattern recognition, cognitive psychology, and semantic activation remain underutilized for advancing commonsense reasoning capabilities. Notably, bridges between reliable explanation frameworks and dynamic multimodal cognitive models for real-time HRI are missing, highlighting a gap in end-to-end human-centered AI systems which integrate explainability, commonsense knowledge, and interaction robustness.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "1. Developing Hybrid Cognitive-Statistical Frameworks for Commonsense-Enhanced Explainability: Leverage global insights linking 'cluster data points' with 'high-probability guarantees' and 'XAI research' to create new explanation models that integrate cognitive semantic activation patterns with statistically robust clustering to interpret LLM decisions in HRI contexts. This addresses the internal gap of lacking semantic grounding and reliability assurances.\n\n2. Integrating Multimodal Pattern Recognition with Commonsense Reasoning Modules: Build upon the bridge concept of 'multimodal feature space' and insights from biomedical and computational psychology domains by combining sensory input analysis (e.g., vision, language) with knowledge-driven commonsense reasoning. This approach targets the unexplored frontier of real-time, context-aware interaction models capable of adapting robot behaviors based on human intent and environment understanding.\n\n3. Designing End-to-End Transparent LLM Architectures with Dynamic Knowledge Injection: Inspired by global co-concepts involving model-agnostic meta-learning and federated learning, innovate LLM frameworks that support continuous incorporation of external commonsense knowledge under privacy and security constraints, enhancing trust and adaptiveness in interactive robotic systems. This innovation directly responds to identified weaknesses in current black-box model transparency and contextual adaptability in human-robot interaction."
