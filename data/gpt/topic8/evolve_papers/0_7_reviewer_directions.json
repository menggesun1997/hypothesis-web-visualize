    "title": "Federated Multi-Expert LLM Systems Preserving Domain Privacy and Encyclopedic Breadth",
    "Problem_Statement": "Tension exists between leveraging private domain data and maintaining open-domain encyclopedic knowledge due to privacy and data sharing limitations.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses limitation of private data reliance by creating a federated multi-expert LLM system that combines decentralized private models with a centralized public model ensuring knowledge fusion without data leakage.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a federated learning framework where private domain-specific LLM instances train locally on private data and periodically communicate distilled knowledge embeddings to a central open-domain encyclopedia LLM that integrates and fine-tunes responses for open-domain QA.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Deploy private LLMs on synthetic private datasets reflecting finance or health data. 2) Train central LLM on public encyclopedic corpora. 3) Implement and test federated distillation mechanisms. 4) Evaluate QA performance, privacy leakage rates, and knowledge breadth.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Provide an investment summary that considers both public market data and proprietary portfolio analytics.' Expected Output: A synthesized, insightful answer leveraging both encrypted private expertise and public knowledge.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated distillation is impractical, adopt secure multi-party computation or homomorphic encryption techniques for knowledge exchange."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines federated distillation of embeddings from private domain-specific LLMs to a centralized open-domain LLM. However, the mechanism lacks clarity regarding how knowledge fusion will occur without data leakage, especially given the complexity of embedding alignment and aggregation across heterogeneous domains. A more detailed methodological description is needed, addressing embedding compatibility, distillation frequency, model update strategies, and mitigation of catastrophic forgetting in the public model. Clarifying these technical details will improve the soundness and credibility of the approach. Examples or references to related federated distillation frameworks would strengthen this section further, making assumptions and system behavior transparent and verifiable under realistic settings. This is critical as the core novelty hinges on effective knowledge integration without compromising privacy or model coherence, which currently remains underspecified in the proposal's description of the mechanism. Further, explicitly defining what constitutes 'knowledge embeddings' and how they encode domain expertise for later fine-tuning would clarify the methodology substantially."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the global concepts linked (such as information retrieval and intelligent computing techniques), the proposal could substantially enhance its impact and novelty by integrating advanced information retrieval methods within the federated multi-expert system. For example, leveraging retrieval-augmented generation techniques at the central LLM could complement federated distillation by dynamically fetching relevant public knowledge to enrich domain-specific embeddings. Additionally, incorporating intelligent computing techniques like adaptive model routing or expert gating could optimize how and when private or public knowledge is prioritized during inference. Integrating such concepts would help differentiate the system beyond existing federated LLM setups, improve scalability, and cater to a wider range of applications beyond question answering alone. This would directly broaden the scope and elevate the research impact, making the approach more robust and aligned with cutting-edge AI research trends highlighted in broadly relevant computer science and technology domains."
