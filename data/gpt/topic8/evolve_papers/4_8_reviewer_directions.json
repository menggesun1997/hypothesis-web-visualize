          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks explicit details about data sources, scale, and validation metrics critical for the realism and reliability of the behavioral models and simulations. Real social media ecosystems are complex, and the plan should specify how user behavior models will handle diversity, temporal dynamics, and interaction modalities. Additionally, the use of LLM-based moderation proxies with tunable ethical parameters requires clearer explanation on how those parameters are defined, operationalized, and calibrated against real-world moderation practices. The validation step through historical case studies needs elaboration on selection criteria and quantitative matching to simulation outcomes to ensure credible forecast accuracy. Incorporating a phased pilot with smaller-scale real-world A/B tests before large-scale deployment would strengthen feasibility and iterative improvement of the simulation platform. Without these clarifications, the experimental plan risks being overly ambitious and under-specified, threatening reproducibility and impact of the results. It is essential to concretize all these components into a more detailed, scientifically rigorous roadmap with measurable milestones and contingency protocols for computational challenges or data scarcity issues, rather than relying mainly on a fallback to simplified models at the end of the process in step 4 (Fallback_Plan). This refinement is critical to the project's successful execution and robustness of derived insights from the simulation environment as a predictive tool for ethical AI moderation impact forecasting. Please expand and specify this section accordingly to strengthen the project's feasibility and sound scientific grounding in methodological design and evaluation procedures, enabling confident deployment and adoption potential in social media platforms' governance frameworks.

          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screened novelty rating of NOV-COMPETITIVE, integrating advances from related globally-linked concepts could substantially enhance both the novelty and impact of the proposed research. Specifically, incorporating recent breakthroughs in natural language processing and generative models such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) can refine the moderation proxies used in simulations to be state-of-the-art, allowing more nuanced, context-aware, and dynamic AI moderation strategies to be tested. Moreover, leveraging reinforcement learning could enable policy optimization within the simulation environment, automatically discovering ethical moderation strategies that balance misinformation suppression with community trust preservation. Including techniques from hate speech detection and speech detection can provide richer content characterization layers, capturing linguistic nuances more rigorously in agent behaviors and interventions. Additionally, borrowing ideas from human-computer interaction research may enhance the realism and interpretability of simulated user responses to moderation actions, improving impact forecasting of ethical outcomes. This interdisciplinary enhancement, combining machine learning, NLP, and specific ethical AI fairness tools, will raise the project's competitiveness, deepen its scientific contributions, and broaden applicability across various social media ecosystems. I recommend explicitly embedding these cutting-edge methodologies in the Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan sections to elevate the research's quality, demonstrate state-of-the-art applicability, and advance a unique, impactful contribution beyond the existing literature and tools in AI moderation ethics forecasting. Doing so will address the critical gap between feasibility and impactful innovation to position this work at the forefront of responsible AI system design and governance research.
