    "title": "Behavior-Informed Bias Mitigation via Psychological Embedding Spaces",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs for moderation show bias due to incomplete world knowledge encoding and insufficient transparency, failing to generalize ethical reasoning across diverse contexts especially regarding emotionally charged content.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal and external critical gaps by innovatively embedding behavioral psychology constructs as bias-mitigation anchors, enabling new pathways to encode ethical reasoning and emotional sensitivity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct embedding spaces where psychological factors like fear generalization and emotional priming serve as dimensions influencing model output bias. Train LLMs with joint losses optimizing for content neutrality and reduced emotional bias, moderated by psychological embedding influence.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Annotate corpora for biased/emotionally charged content. 2) Develop behavioral embedding modules using psychological literature. 3) Train models with multi-objective losses integrating embeddings. 4) Evaluate on bias benchmarks (e.g., StereoSet) and emotional misclassification rates.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Moderation of posts stereotyping a minority group using fear-laden language. Expected output: model identifies both bias and emotional manipulation effects, flagging accordingly.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-objective training destabilizes, use embedding post-processing filters and evaluate incremental integration methods."
