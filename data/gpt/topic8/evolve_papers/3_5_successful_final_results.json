    "Problem_Statement": "Most continual learning methods for LLMs neglect cross-modal knowledge sources such as text embedded in images and videos, limiting adaptive updates from rich, real-world data streams like scanned documents or street signs.",
    "Motivation": "Bridges external gap about integrating optical character recognition (OCR) and continual learning, which remains unexplored, enabling LLMs to incorporate real-time multimodal world knowledge effectively.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a continual learning pipeline that uses fine-tuned OCR systems to extract textual data from images/videos, followed by a continual visual-linguistic embedding alignment module. This module incrementally updates LLM representations by reinforcing semantic coherence between visual context and extracted text without rehearsal, using transformer-based cross-modal contrastive learning reinforced by graph-based semantic constraints. The model can adapt to evolving visual-textual knowledge, maintaining stability in linguistic representations while integrating new multimodal information streams in real time.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Integrate pretrained OCR models with continual learning LLM backend. 2) Use datasets with evolving visual-text content (e.g., news media, street view imagery). 3) Baselines: text-only continual learning vs. multimodal update. 4) Metrics: knowledge accuracy, forgetting, cross-modal alignment scores, real-time adaptation speed. 5) Assess robustness to noisy OCR output and domain shifts.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Series of news images with embedded texts about recent political events; Output: LLM accurately answering newly introduced event-related queries supported by multimodal updated knowledge, preserving previous knowledge intact.",

        "title": "Multimodal OCR-Infused Continual Learning with Scene Graph-Enhanced Cross-Modal Alignment for Robust Real-Time Knowledge Expansion",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current continual learning paradigms for large language models (LLMs) primarily focus on textual streams and often overlook multimodal real-world knowledge sources, such as text embedded in images and videos. This oversight neglects critical information from evolving visual contexts like scanned documents, street scenes, and multimedia news, limiting the LLM's ability to adapt effectively. Moreover, integrating noisy OCR outputs with LLM updates without rehearsal poses significant challenges, including semantic drift, catastrophic forgetting, and unstable representation alignment in continual learning with multimodal noisy inputs.",
        "Motivation": "While continual learning for LLMs is advancing, integrating real-time multimodal knowledge—particularly text extracted through OCR from dynamic visual inputs—is underexplored and technically challenging. Our approach transcends existing methods by explicitly addressing stability and semantic coherence without depending on traditional rehearsal strategies. By combining OCR, scene graph generation, and state-of-the-art cross-modal contrastive learning enhanced with graph-based semantic constraints, we aim to establish a robust, scalable continual learning pipeline. This fusion uniquely enables LLMs to semantically align and reason over evolving multimodal data, positioning the model to continually acquire and integrate diverse, noisy world knowledge streams. This focus on structured visual-linguistic embedding alignment, semantic conflict resolution, and real-time robustness marks a substantive advance over current competitive approaches.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a rigorously designed multimodal continual learning framework comprising the following components:\n\n1. **Preprocessing and OCR Integration:** We employ fine-tuned, domain-adaptive OCR engines optimized for noisy and diverse visual environments to extract textual information from image and video frames.\n\n2. **Scene Graph Generation:** Before embedding alignment, visual input is processed by a scene graph generator that produces structured semantic graphs capturing entities, attributes, and relationships within images/videos. These graphs enrich contextual understanding and provide explicit relational knowledge, addressing semantic ambiguity inherent in raw OCR text.\n\n3. **Cross-Modal Embedding Modules:** Utilizing transformer-based self-attention architectures, separate encoders generate embeddings for extracted OCR text, scene graph nodes, and LLM textual tokens. These embedding spaces are maintained with modality-specific normalization layers.\n\n4. **Graph-Based Semantic Constraints:** We incorporate the scene graphs directly into a graph neural network (GNN) module that imposes semantic constraints to refine alignment between visual and textual embeddings. The GNN propagates relational information, aiding conflict detection and resolution when integrating new knowledge.\n\n5. **Incremental Update Algorithm with Stability Guarantees:** The core continual learning update proceeds in discrete steps for each new batch of multimodal data:\n\n   - a) Compute contrastive loss aligning OCR text and scene graph embeddings with corresponding LLM token embeddings.\n\n   - b) Detect semantic conflicts by analyzing graph-based similarities and embedding discrepancies using a conflict scoring function.\n\n   - c) Employ gated adapter modules that selectively integrate new representations, weighted by confidence scores reflecting OCR noise and semantic consistency.\n\n   - d) Apply a regularization term inspired by Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) adapted for multimodal embeddings to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.\n\n   Pseudocode snippet:\n   ```\n   for batch in data_stream:\n       ocr_text = OCR(batch.images)\n       scene_graph = SceneGraphGenerator(batch.images)\n       text_emb = TextEncoder(ocr_text)\n       sg_emb = GraphEncoder(scene_graph)\n       llm_emb = LLMEncoder(batch.text_context)\n       loss = ContrastiveLoss(text_emb, sg_emb, llm_emb)\n       conflicts = ConflictDetector(sg_emb, llm_emb)\n       adapters.update(gate(conflicts, confidence_scores))\n       llm.update(loss + Regularization(loss_ewc))\n   ```\n\n6. **Handling Noisy and Conflicting Data:** OCR confidence scores and graph consistency metrics dynamically modulate the fusion weights within gated adapters, enabling robust filtering of unreliable signals while preserving useful incremental knowledge.\n\n7. **Integration with Visual Question Answering (VQA) Methods:** \n\n   To validate semantic alignment and reasoning capabilities, we adapt state-of-the-art text-based VQA architectures, incorporating self-attention fusion layers, as evaluation modules. These modules query the updated LLM embedding space for complex visual-textual understanding, thus serving both as a validation for acquired knowledge and a robust baseline for performance comparisons.\n\nThis detailed mechanism ensures transparent reproducibility, addresses catastrophic forgetting and semantic drift through principled constraints and modular update strategies, and leverages scene graphs and advanced VQA strategies to surpass existing pipelines in robustness, semantic richness, and real-time adaptability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) **Module Integration:** Combine pretrained OCR engines, scene graph generators, and transformer-based encoders with gated adapter modules and graph-based constraint networks.\n\n2) **Dataset Curation:** Prepare evolving multimodal datasets combining news media images/video streams with temporally shifting embedded text and accompanying textual contexts (e.g., annotated street view imagery, evolving social media news datasets).\n\n3) **Baseline Comparisons:** Evaluate against text-only continual learning models, OCR-informed pipelines without scene graphs, and state-of-the-art multimodal continual learners using only contrastive loss.\n\n4) **Metric Suite:** Measure knowledge accuracy, forgetting rates (via recall of prior information), cross-modal alignment quality (using graph-based semantic consistency scores), and real-time adaptation latency.\n\n5) **Ablation Studies:** Test advantages of gated adapters, graph-based constraints, and scene graph integration independently and combined.\n\n6) **Robustness Tests:** Simulate varying OCR noise levels and domain shifts to assess stability.\n\n7) **Visual Question Answering Validation:** Implement adapted text-based VQA tasks to measure semantic reasoning improvements on the incrementally updated LLM.\n\n8) **Analysis:** Detailed error analysis on semantic conflict resolution, catastrophic forgetting mitigation, and module-wise contribution to overall system performance.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "- **Input:** Sequential streams of news images containing political banners, street signs, and event posters with evolving textual content; paired with videos capturing real-time events.\n\n- **Expected Output:** \n  - The LLM, updated incrementally, correctly answers queries about recent political developments reflected in images, exhibiting accurate recall and inference without losing earlier knowledge.\n  - The system demonstrates semantic consistency across modalities, correctly resolving conflicts where OCR text is ambiguous by leveraging scene graph relational context.\n  - Visual question answering tasks, such as 'What is the main slogan on the protester's banner in the latest image?' yield correct, confident responses, validating the continual knowledge embedding.\n\n- **Robustness:** When fed noisy or partial OCR outputs, the LLM refrains from propagating erroneous updates, maintaining stable knowledge states.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the integrated graph-based semantic constraints or gated adapter modules prove unstable or computationally impractical at scale, we will:\n\n1) Temporarily isolate modal updates by scheduling separate incremental learning phases per modality (OCR-text, scene graph, textual context).\n\n2) Employ lightweight adapter fusion layers with dynamic gating optimized through reinforcement learning to selectively merge modalities with minimal noisy influence.\n\n3) Leverage pretrained multimodal foundation models as fixed embedding providers, focusing on fine-tuning solely the adapter layers for efficiency.\n\n4) Incorporate curriculum learning strategies to introduce noisy or conflicting visual-text data in controlled increments, allowing gradual adaptation.\n\nThis staged fallback ensures methodical progress toward full multimodal continual learning robustness without sacrificing real-time applicability or reproducibility, maintaining the overarching goal of stable, semantically rich, and scalable knowledge integration."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a complex pipeline involving fine-tuned OCR, continual visual-linguistic embedding alignment, transformer-based cross-modal contrastive learning, and graph-based semantic constraints. However, the mechanism lacks clarity on how the incremental updates maintain LLM stability without rehearsal, especially when integrating noisy and potentially conflicting multimodal signals. Explicit algorithmic details or pseudocode describing the continual update steps, the handling of semantic conflicts, and the role of graph-based constraints in the embedding space alignment are needed to fully assess algorithmic soundness and reproducibility. Strengthening this section with clearer, stepwise methodological exposition will enhance comprehension and evaluation of feasibility and validity of the claims about stability and seamless integration of multimodal knowledge streams without catastrophic forgetting or semantic drift in LLM representations, which is a critical challenge in continual learning contexts with noisy multimodal data sources. This is a must-fix for method soundness and trustworthiness of the approach at this stage, especially given its novelty claim in a competitive area. Targeted internal testing scenarios simulating incremental multimodal knowledge streams and explicit description of how the method addresses noisy OCR outputs in the contrastive learning framework would be impactful additions here as well, beyond the experiment plan. Please revise accordingly with focus on transparent mechanism design and theoretical rationale underpinning the approach's stability guarantees or mitigation strategies for the known continual learning challenges in this multimodal setting (e.g., catastrophic forgetting). It is crucial for reviewers and subsequent adopters to understand the method’s inner workings in detail to assess replicability and effectiveness of the proposed continual adaptation framework with OCR-infused multimodality compositions under real-world noisy conditions and dynamic data shifts identified in the motivation and problem statement sections. This also strengthens justification of the eventual experiments planned. Thus, this detailed elaboration is essential to move forward confidently from novelty screening to full review phase and practical implementation potential assessment, especially given the complexity and competition noted in the domain area. Please provide a more rigorous, comprehensible, and transparent method description with concrete algorithmic steps and rationale here first, before proceeding further to implementation and evaluation based on the current high-level description. This targets a key bottleneck in soundness and reproducibility for an innovative multimodal continual learning pipeline integrating OCR signals into LLM updates in real time context, which is non-trivial and challenging at scale and noise levels described. The improvement will greatly clarify and validate your approach and proof-of-concept feasibility, offering potential reviewers a robust understanding to support subsequent impact and feasibility claims you make in the proposal and experiments planned sections. This is absolutely critical because it is the foundation that underpins all claims and the future steps of validation and impact demonstration, so please prioritize this improvement first and foremost for strong scientific grounding of your research idea beyond novelty indication, enabling constructive peer critique, adoption, and impact realization downstream at the premier conference venue target level. We look forward to seeing this stronger, clearer core method narrative and operational detail next iteration from you as a top-tier research rigour principle indicator and to unlock the full proposal potential towards addressing the significant open problem stated.

          "feedback_content": "Given the highly competitive novelty assessment of this idea, integrating cutting-edge, globally-relevant concepts from nearby domains can enhance both novelty and impact significantly. Specifically, leveraging scene graph representations can enrich the graph-based semantic constraints module by providing more structured, relational knowledge about entities within visual contexts, which aligns well with the proposed graph-based constraints. Additionally, incorporating advances from text-based visual question answering methods and self-attention-based models may allow for improved cross-modal reasoning and better semantic alignment in the continual learning pipeline. To concretely enhance your method, consider integrating a scene graph generation step upstream of the continual embedding alignment, which would create richer visual semantic graphs to feed the graph-based constraints. Furthermore, adapting state-of-the-art answering methods from visual question answering to validate the knowledge acquisition and reasoning capabilities of your continuously updated LLM could serve as stronger evaluation baselines and improve test case expressiveness. Exploring architectural adaptations to resolve any potential conflicts between transformer-based contrastive learning modules and these state-of-the-art components would position your work at the cutting-edge intersection of multimodal understanding and continual learning. This strategy will sharpen your contribution’s focus, broaden its applicability, and potentially unlock higher impact by connecting with and advancing existing top-performing methods in related areas within the premier conference landscape. By embracing these globally-linked concepts, you can reinforce your pipeline’s robustness, scalability, and semantic sophistication, thereby enhancing both the scientific merit and practical relevance of your research endeavor.
