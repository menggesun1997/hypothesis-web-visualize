        "title": "Cognitive-Semantic Clustering for Commonsense in HRI",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLMs integrated into human-robot interaction (HRI) lack adequate grounding in commonsense knowledge that reflects human cognitive semantic activation, resulting in suboptimal explainability and collaboration effectiveness.",
        "Motivation": "This project addresses the internal gap of insufficient semantic grounding in LLMs for HRI by leveraging the critical gap on lack of cognitive-inspired commonsense frameworks. It exploits the high-potential innovation opportunity to develop hybrid cognitive-statistical frameworks that integrate semantic activation patterns with robust clustering methods for interpretation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid framework combining cognitive semantic network activation models with high-probability statistical clustering algorithms to analyze and explain LLM decisions in HRI contexts. The method constructs semantic networks inspired by cognitive psychology to represent commonsense knowledge and uses clustering methods (mean shift, quick shift) to robustly identify decision patterns with statistical guarantees. Explanations are generated by linking clusters with cognitive semantic activations highlighting the rationale behind LLM outputs in an interpretable manner.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble a multimodal HRI dataset including dialogue transcripts, robot sensor data, and user feedback.\n2) Implement baseline LLMs with existing commonsense integration.\n3) Develop the cognitive-semantic network construction module representing commonsense concepts.\n4) Apply clustering (mean shift, quick shift) integrating semantic activations on model internal states/representations.\n5) Measure explanation quality using human subject studies and automatic transparency metrics.\n6) Compare robustness under uncertainty with model-agnostic explanation baselines.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A robot assistant responds to a human saying 'Bring me something to drink because I am thirsty.'\nExpected output: The system clusters the LLM output patterns tied to commonsense semantic concepts like 'thirst' and 'drink' and explains that the robot decided to fetch a beverage due to activated concepts related to thirst in its semantic network, demonstrating contextual commonsense understanding.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If clustering semantic activations does not yield meaningful patterns, alternative dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-SNE combined with attention visualization will be explored. Additionally, we will evaluate incorporating pretrained cognitive semantic embeddings or symbolic knowledge graphs for enhanced grounding."

        "title": "Multimodal Commonsense Fusion for Context-Aware Robot Behavior",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current HRI systems do not effectively integrate sensory inputs with commonsense reasoning, limiting robots' ability to adapt behavior dynamically according to nuanced human intent and environmental context.",
        "Motivation": "This research responds to the gap of missing multimodal sensorimotor data integration with commonsense reasoning identified in the landscape analysis and capitalizes on the innovation opportunity to combine pattern recognition with knowledge-driven commonsense models in real-time interaction.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We introduce a multimodal fusion architecture that processes visual, auditory, and textual inputs alongside a commonsense reasoning module based on knowledge graphs and probabilistic logic. Sensory data are encoded via deep multimodal pattern recognition techniques, which feed into a symbolic reasoning layer that updates predictions and robot action plans with commonsense constraints and inferences. The system supports continuous contextual adaptation in HRI scenarios.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect a real-world HRI dataset with synchronized multimodal sensory streams and interaction logs.\n2) Train deep models for each modality and develop cross-modal fusion layers.\n3) Build a commonsense reasoning engine leveraging ConceptNet and probabilistic soft logic.\n4) Integrate the reasoning module with multimodal representation in an end-to-end pipeline.\n5) Evaluate adaptability and accuracy of robot responses in simulated and user study environments.\n6) Benchmark interaction naturalness, responsiveness, and safety against purely statistical or purely symbolic baselines.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A person points at an empty cup and says 'Fill this up please.'\nExpected output: The system visually detects the cup, interprets pointing gesture, accesses commonsense knowledge about cups and filling liquids, and plans robot behavior to fill the cup with water.\nExplanation segments indicate fusion of vision, language, and commonsense modules leading to the action plan.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time fusion proves computationally expensive, we will explore hierarchical or cascading approaches prioritizing critical modalities or pre-filtering inputs. Alternatively, replacing probabilistic logic with neural-symbolic approximation methods might improve scalability."

        "title": "Federated Commonsense Injection for Privacy-Preserving LLMs in Robotics",
        "Problem_Statement": "Incorporating external commonsense knowledge into LLMs for HRI faces constraints of data privacy, heterogeneity, and continuous adaptation in deployed robotic systems, limiting model transparency and trustworthiness.",
        "Motivation": "This addresses the external gap of lacking frameworks supporting ongoing knowledge integration with privacy by innovating on the high-potential opportunity for dynamic knowledge injection via federated and meta-learning strategies in transparent LLM architectures tailored to HRI.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a federated learning framework where multiple robots locally update LLM components with relevant commonsense knowledge derived from interactions and environment while sharing encrypted gradients. Model-agnostic meta-learning facilitates rapid adaptation to heterogeneous contexts. A transparency layer records knowledge injections and model changes to support explainability. This paradigm enables continuous privacy-aware knowledge enrichment improving HRI reliability and contextual awareness.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Simulate federated settings with robots in diverse environments with distinct commonsense needs.\n2) Deploy base LLM with modular commonsense adapters.\n3) Implement federated optimization and encrypted communication protocols.\n4) Integrate meta-learning to speed local adaptation.\n5) Design transparency protocols logging knowledge updates.\n6) Use longitudinal HRI evaluation on metrics: model accuracy, privacy leakage, trust from user feedback, and explanation clarity.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multiple robots encounter new cultural customs requiring adjusted interaction language.\nExpected output: Local updates incorporating new commonsense facts propagate encrypted model changes federatedly;\nRobots adapt outputs to culturally appropriate responses;\nTransparency module traces adaptations with audit logs explaining modifications.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated learning causes model degradation due to heterogeneity, cluster devices with similar contexts for partial federation or rely on centralized periodic knowledge distillation. Alternatively, focus on differential privacy with centralized incremental learning."

        "title": "Dynamic Explainability via Semantic Activation Feedback Loops",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current XAI methods for LLMs in HRI lack mechanisms to dynamically update explanations as contextual semantic activations evolve during interactions, reducing real-time trust and interpretability.",
        "Motivation": "Filling the gap of missing end-to-end explainability frameworks that integrate dynamic semantic grounding for HRI, this project leverages cognitive semantic activation to generate evolving, interactive explanations responsive to interaction progression, enhancing user trust and collaboration quality.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a feedback-driven explainability system that monitors real-time semantic activation states within LLMs during HRI. The system generates continuously updated explanations highlighting how activated commonsense concepts influence model decisions. User feedback is incorporated to refine semantic activation models and explanation granularity. The approach combines anchoring explanation methods with cognitive semantic dynamics.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect interactive HRI sessions annotated with commonsense reasoning points.\n2) Implement real-time semantic activation trackers inside LLM layers.\n3) Design dynamic explanation modules that update explanation outputs according to activation changes.\n4) Conduct user studies assessing perceived trust and comprehension versus static explanation baselines.\n5) Analyze feedback-driven adaptation efficiency and explanation stability.\n6) Test across heterogeneous HRI scenarios requiring different commonsense domains.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User asks the robot for 'a warm blanket if it's cold.'\nExpected output: Initially the explanation references temperature commonsense activations; if user adds 'I just spilled coffee,' explanations dynamically incorporate spill-related safety commonsense concepts influencing behavior changes.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time updates hinder system responsiveness, a compromise with batch update explanations or user-triggered refreshes will be tested. Alternative explanation modalities, such as visual graphs of concept activation trajectories, will be explored."

        "title": "Cross-Domain Pattern Recognition for Commonsense Knowledge Transfer",
        "Problem_Statement": "Commonsense reasoning capabilities developed for biomedical or cognitive psychology domains rarely transfer effectively to human-robot interaction, due to lack of robust pattern recognition bridging methods across domains.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the external multidisciplinary gap identified, this project proposes novel algorithms for cross-domain pattern extraction and transfer between cognitive psychology, biomedical data, and HRI, to enhance commonsense reasoning models for robotics with insights from established domains.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create a universal pattern recognition framework leveraging kernel methods and non-Euclidean feature space representations to find common semantic and behavioral motifs in diverse domain datasets. These motifs serve as transferable commonsense knowledge components that bootstrap reasoning modules in HRI LLMs. The method includes domain adaptation layers that align heterogeneous data distributions and support incremental learning of shared concepts.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather datasets from biomedical sensor readings, cognitive experiments, and HRI interaction logs.\n2) Implement kernel-based clustering and manifold learning to extract patterns within each domain.\n3) Develop alignment mechanisms using adversarial domain adaptation.\n4) Train HRI LLMs incorporating transferred commonsense components.\n5) Evaluate transfer effectiveness via reasoning accuracy, generalization, and user trust.\n6) Compare against domain-isolated models.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Knowledge about human stress responses from biomedical data is mapped to HRI scenarios detecting user agitation.\nExpected output: Adapted commonsense modules enable robot to interpret elevated stress signs, explaining decisions to modify interaction tone accordingly.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If alignment proves insufficient, focus on meta-representation learning capturing higher-level abstractions common to all domains. If transfer is noisy, incorporate expert curated seed knowledge to guide transfer process."
