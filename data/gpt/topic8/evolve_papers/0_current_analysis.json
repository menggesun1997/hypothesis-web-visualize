The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'ChatGPT is fun, but not an author', 'abstract': 'In less than 2 months, the artificial intelligence (AI) program ChatGPT has become a cultural sensation. It is freely accessible through a web portal created by the tool\\'s developer, OpenAI. The program-which automatically creates text based on written prompts-is so popular that it\\'s likely to be \"at capacity right now\" if you attempt to use it. When you do get through, ChatGPT provides endless entertainment. I asked it to rewrite the first scene of the classic American play <i>Death of a Salesman</i>, but to feature Princess Elsa from the animated movie <i>Frozen</i> as the main character instead of Willy Loman. The output was an amusing conversation in which Elsa-who has come home from a tough day of selling-is told by her son Happy, \"Come on, Mom. You\\'re Elsa from <i>Frozen</i>. You have ice powers and you\\'re a queen. You\\'re unstoppable.\" Mash-ups like this are certainly fun, but there are serious implications for generative AI programs like ChatGPT in science and academia.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'ChatGPT for (Finance) research: The Bananarama Conjecture', 'abstract': 'We show, based on ratings by finance journal reviewers of generated output, that the recently released AI chatbot ChatGPT can significantly assist with finance research. In principle, these results should be generalisable across research domains. There are clear advantages for idea generation and data identification. The technology, however, is weaker on literature synthesis and developing appropriate testing frameworks. Importantly, we further demonstrate that the extent of private data and researcher domain expertise input, are key factors in determining the quality of output. We conclude by considering the implications, particularly the ethical implications, which arise from this new technology.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'To Be, or Not to Be … Original Under Copyright Law, That Is (One of) the Main Questions Concerning AI-Produced Works', 'abstract': 'Abstract\\n                  This paper will examine whether different types of AI-produced works, namely AI-assisted, AI-generated, and AI-genassisted works, are able to satisfy the originality requirement, as established within the EU copyright acquis. It will argue that even assuming that the choices of AIs can be deemed free, they could not be considered creative due to the anthropological footprint of copyright law which traditionally covers only human creativity. This implies that copyright protection can be granted only to outputs that display a sufficient level of original human intervention, which is most likely present in AI-assisted works and, depending on the case, in AI-genassisted works, too. The desirability of stretching copyright further to accommodate artificial creativity is also lessened by the risk that it could saturate the creative market due to an overexpansion of monopoly rights. Thus, the copyright solution will be evaluated together with some existing alternative legal tools, such as neighbouring rights, sui generis rights, patents, or even the absence of protection over AI-generated works to preserve a robust public domain.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'A Primer on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Finance', 'abstract': 'Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful and emerging technique for solving complex decision-making problems by learning from experience and interaction with an environment. In the field of finance, DRL has the potential to revolutionize the way we optimize portfolios, manage risk, and execute trades, by leveraging the vast amounts of data available and the ability of neural networks to learn and adapt. However, applying DRL to finance problems also poses several challenges, such as dealing with high-dimensional state spaces, long-term dependencies, and limited data. In this paper, we review the key concepts and algorithms of DRL, and we describe the opportunities and challenges of applying DRL to finance problems, such as portfolio optimization, risk management, and algorithmic trading. We also present several case studies and examples of how DRL has been applied to finance problems, and we discuss the evaluation and potential future directions of DRL in finance. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of DRL in finance and to highlight the potential and limitations of this promising field of research and application.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'An Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning', 'abstract': 'Deep reinforcement learning is the combination of reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning. This field of research has been able to solve a wide range of complex decisionmaking tasks that were previously out of reach for a machine. Thus, deep RL opens up many new applications in domains such as healthcare, robotics, smart grids, finance, and many more. This manuscript provides an introduction to deep reinforcement learning models, algorithms and techniques. Particular focus is on the aspects related to generalization and how deep RL can be used for practical applications. We assume the reader is familiar with basic machine learning concepts.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'FinRL: Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework to Automate Trading in Quantitative Finance', 'abstract': 'Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been envisioned to have a competitive edge in quantitative finance. However, there is a steep development curve for quantitative traders to obtain an agent that automatically positions to win in the market, namely to decide where to trade, at what price and what quantity, due to the error-prone programming and arduous debugging. In this paper, we present the first open-source framework FinRL as a full pipeline to help quantitative traders overcome the steep learning curve. FinRL is featured with simplicity, applicability and extensibility under the key principles, full-stack framework, customization, reproducibility and hands-on tutoring. Embodied as a three-layer architecture with modular structures, FinRL implements fine-tuned state-of-the-art DRL algorithms and common reward functions, while alleviating the debugging work- loads. Thus, we help users pipeline the strategy design at a high turnover rate. At multiple levels of time granularity, FinRL simu- lates various markets as training environments using historical data and live trading APIs. Being highly extensible, FinRL reserves a set of user-import interfaces and incorporates trading constraints such as market friction, market liquidity and investor’s risk-aversion. Moreover, serving as practitioners’ stepping stones, typical trad- ing tasks are provided as step-by-step tutorials, e.g., stock trading, portfolio allocation, cryptocurrency trading, etc.'}]\n```\n\n**Part A.2: The Evolution Links (Edges of the Graph):**\nThe following list defines the citation relationships between the papers in Part A.

    "title": "Landscape Map for Investigating Semantic Encoding of Encyclopedic World Knowledge in LLMs for Open-Domain QA",
    "current_research_landscape": "The current research in semantic encoding of encyclopedic world knowledge within large language models (LLMs) for open-domain question answering primarily centers on understanding and improving the quality of AI-generated text output, with a strong emphasis on finance research applications and digital transformation contexts. The dominant approach involves leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks, as evidenced by extensive work on finance-focused automation and decision-making models (e.g., portfolio optimization and trading algorithms). This focus emerged as a response to earlier challenges related to the reliability, domain specificity, and ethical/legal concerns of generative AI outputs, notably highlighted by critiques of ChatGPT's capabilities and limitations in non-expert synthesis and testing frameworks. Central nodes such as \"artificial intelligence,\" \"text,\" \"finance research,\" and \"quality of output\" reflect this consensus. The thematic islands cluster into AI-driven entertainment and text generation, finance domain research with private data considerations, and digital transformation of organizations, illustrating a multidisciplinary yet somewhat fragmented landscape.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internally, there is a significant gap in methods for robustly synthesizing and verifying encyclopedic knowledge encoded in LLMs, as current models tend to rely heavily on private domain-specific data inputs and lack generalized testing frameworks, limiting their interpretability and reliability in open-domain settings. Ethical and legal challenges regarding the originality and human creativity behind AI-generated content remain underexplored. Moreover, despite focus on finance and organizational digital transformation, there is an underrepresentation of linguistic, psychological, and social dimensions impacting semantic encoding and knowledge representation. Externally, the global context reveals overlooked cross-disciplinary bridges—for instance, linking literary studies and discourse analysis with research domains could provide rich insights into the textual historicity and semantic depth of LLM knowledge. Similarly, integrating concepts from occupational safety, green supply chain management, and health sciences into AI research domains suggests potential for enhancing AI’s knowledge representation with contextually grounded and ethically informed frameworks. These areas remain unexplored frontiers for semantic encoding research in LLMs.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "1. **Integrative Semantic Evaluation Framework:** Develop cross-disciplinary evaluation methodologies that incorporate discourse analysis and literary historicity (from creative arts and linguistics) with current AI testing frameworks to better assess semantic accuracy and contextual depth in LLM-generated encyclopedic knowledge. This addresses the internal gap in robust synthesis while leveraging global bridges identified between 'Willy Loman' and 'information technology industry'.\n\n2. **Ethically-Informed Knowledge Encoding Models:** Create AI knowledge representation architectures that embed ethical, legal, and social considerations drawing from occupational safety, health sciences, and supply chain management domains, thus filling the underexplored external gaps in digital transformation research and addressing the neglect of ethical dimensions in AI content generation.\n\n3. **Multi-Domain Data and Domain Expertise Fusion:** Investigate methods to merge private domain expertise with public encyclopedic knowledge in LLM training pipelines, improving generalized testing frameworks and output quality, particularly for open-domain question answering in finance and beyond. This opportunity builds upon the central bridging role of 'finance research' and 'private data' while responding to identified performance limitations of current domain-specific models."
