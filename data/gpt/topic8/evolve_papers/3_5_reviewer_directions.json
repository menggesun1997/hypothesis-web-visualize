    "title": "Multimodal OCR-Infused Continual Learning for Real-Time Knowledge Expansion",
    "Problem_Statement": "Most continual learning methods for LLMs neglect cross-modal knowledge sources such as text embedded in images and videos, limiting adaptive updates from rich, real-world data streams like scanned documents or street signs.",
    "Motivation": "Bridges external gap about integrating optical character recognition (OCR) and continual learning, which remains unexplored, enabling LLMs to incorporate real-time multimodal world knowledge effectively.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a continual learning pipeline that uses fine-tuned OCR systems to extract textual data from images/videos, followed by a continual visual-linguistic embedding alignment module. This module incrementally updates LLM representations by reinforcing semantic coherence between visual context and extracted text without rehearsal, using transformer-based cross-modal contrastive learning reinforced by graph-based semantic constraints. The model can adapt to evolving visual-textual knowledge, maintaining stability in linguistic representations while integrating new multimodal information streams in real time.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Integrate pretrained OCR models with continual learning LLM backend. 2) Use datasets with evolving visual-text content (e.g., news media, street view imagery). 3) Baselines: text-only continual learning vs. multimodal update. 4) Metrics: knowledge accuracy, forgetting, cross-modal alignment scores, real-time adaptation speed. 5) Assess robustness to noisy OCR output and domain shifts.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Series of news images with embedded texts about recent political events; Output: LLM accurately answering newly introduced event-related queries supported by multimodal updated knowledge, preserving previous knowledge intact.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cross-modal alignment is unstable, first isolate modalities with separate update schedules and later fuse representations via gated mechanisms or adapter modules optimized for noisy multimodal signals."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a complex pipeline involving fine-tuned OCR, continual visual-linguistic embedding alignment, transformer-based cross-modal contrastive learning, and graph-based semantic constraints. However, the mechanism lacks clarity on how the incremental updates maintain LLM stability without rehearsal, especially when integrating noisy and potentially conflicting multimodal signals. Explicit algorithmic details or pseudocode describing the continual update steps, the handling of semantic conflicts, and the role of graph-based constraints in the embedding space alignment are needed to fully assess algorithmic soundness and reproducibility. Strengthening this section with clearer, stepwise methodological exposition will enhance comprehension and evaluation of feasibility and validity of the claims about stability and seamless integration of multimodal knowledge streams without catastrophic forgetting or semantic drift in LLM representations, which is a critical challenge in continual learning contexts with noisy multimodal data sources. This is a must-fix for method soundness and trustworthiness of the approach at this stage, especially given its novelty claim in a competitive area. Targeted internal testing scenarios simulating incremental multimodal knowledge streams and explicit description of how the method addresses noisy OCR outputs in the contrastive learning framework would be impactful additions here as well, beyond the experiment plan. Please revise accordingly with focus on transparent mechanism design and theoretical rationale underpinning the approach's stability guarantees or mitigation strategies for the known continual learning challenges in this multimodal setting (e.g., catastrophic forgetting). It is crucial for reviewers and subsequent adopters to understand the method’s inner workings in detail to assess replicability and effectiveness of the proposed continual adaptation framework with OCR-infused multimodality compositions under real-world noisy conditions and dynamic data shifts identified in the motivation and problem statement sections. This also strengthens justification of the eventual experiments planned. Thus, this detailed elaboration is essential to move forward confidently from novelty screening to full review phase and practical implementation potential assessment, especially given the complexity and competition noted in the domain area. Please provide a more rigorous, comprehensible, and transparent method description with concrete algorithmic steps and rationale here first, before proceeding further to implementation and evaluation based on the current high-level description. This targets a key bottleneck in soundness and reproducibility for an innovative multimodal continual learning pipeline integrating OCR signals into LLM updates in real time context, which is non-trivial and challenging at scale and noise levels described. The improvement will greatly clarify and validate your approach and proof-of-concept feasibility, offering potential reviewers a robust understanding to support subsequent impact and feasibility claims you make in the proposal and experiments planned sections. This is absolutely critical because it is the foundation that underpins all claims and the future steps of validation and impact demonstration, so please prioritize this improvement first and foremost for strong scientific grounding of your research idea beyond novelty indication, enabling constructive peer critique, adoption, and impact realization downstream at the premier conference venue target level. We look forward to seeing this stronger, clearer core method narrative and operational detail next iteration from you as a top-tier research rigour principle indicator and to unlock the full proposal potential towards addressing the significant open problem stated. Thank you! (SOU-MECHANISM) (Proposed_Method) "

          "feedback_content": "Given the highly competitive novelty assessment of this idea, integrating cutting-edge, globally-relevant concepts from nearby domains can enhance both novelty and impact significantly. Specifically, leveraging scene graph representations can enrich the graph-based semantic constraints module by providing more structured, relational knowledge about entities within visual contexts, which aligns well with the proposed graph-based constraints. Additionally, incorporating advances from text-based visual question answering methods and self-attention-based models may allow for improved cross-modal reasoning and better semantic alignment in the continual learning pipeline. To concretely enhance your method, consider integrating a scene graph generation step upstream of the continual embedding alignment, which would create richer visual semantic graphs to feed the graph-based constraints. Furthermore, adapting state-of-the-art answering methods from visual question answering to validate the knowledge acquisition and reasoning capabilities of your continuously updated LLM could serve as stronger evaluation baselines and improve test case expressiveness. Exploring architectural adaptations to resolve any potential conflicts between transformer-based contrastive learning modules and these state-of-the-art components would position your work at the cutting-edge intersection of multimodal understanding and continual learning. This strategy will sharpen your contribution’s focus, broaden its applicability, and potentially unlock higher impact by connecting with and advancing existing top-performing methods in related areas within the premier conference landscape. By embracing these globally-linked concepts, you can reinforce your pipeline’s robustness, scalability, and semantic sophistication, thereby enhancing both the scientific merit and practical relevance of your research endeavor. Please revise your proposal to explicitly incorporate or plan these integrations, articulating their benefits and impact pathways. This feedback is key to leapfrog beyond a competitive novelty zone into a truly distinctive and influential research contribution. (SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION) (Proposed_Method)"
