    "title": "Public Health AI Moderation with Embedded Surveillance Auditing",
    "Problem_Statement": "Generative AI used in public health misinformation control lacks embedded auditing mechanisms aligned with public health surveillance protocols, risking uninformed or harmful responses in free-text health queries.",
    "Motivation": "Direct gap-filling of the external issue where public health informatics and AI prompt tuning remain disconnected. Embedding surveillance-aware auditing mechanisms ensures accountability and ethical risk mitigation in critical health communication scenarios.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an AI moderation system integrating LLMs with real-time public health surveillance data and audit trails inspired by CDC monitoring strategies. The system uses prompt conditions informed by surveillance signals and logs decisions with traceable metadata for ethical review and continuous feedback.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets of health misinformation and associated public health event data. 2) Incorporate surveillance indicators into prompt tuning to bias responses towards safety and accuracy. 3) Build automated logging and auditing modules. 4) Evaluate for misinformation reduction, response accuracy, and audit trace completeness against baselines lacking these mechanisms.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User query about vaccine safety amid an outbreak. Output: AI gives evidence-based, cautious guidance, with audit logs detailing public health data references and ethical checks passed.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If surveillance data integration is noisy or delayed, fallback to static health ethics constraints with manual audits. Use synthetic surveillance scenarios to stress-test system robustness."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines integrating LLMs with real-time public health surveillance data and audit trails; however, the description lacks detail on how this integration will technically enforce reliable, ethical moderation, especially given potential data noise and latency. The method should more explicitly clarify the mechanism of incorporating and aligning surveillance signals with prompt conditions, and how audit trails tightly connect decisions to surveillance data to ensure traceability without compromising user privacy or system transparency. Without concrete architectural or algorithmic design details, the mechanism's soundness remains uncertain and needs strengthening to assure reviewers and implementers of its practicality and correctness."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is broadly outlined yet omits critical considerations that may undermine feasibility. Key missing elements include specifics on data sources for public health surveillance and misinformation datasets, strategies to handle noisy or incomplete surveillance data, metrics and protocols for evaluating audit trail completeness and ethical compliance, as well as plans for user impact assessment in real-world settings. The plan should also address potential challenges in real-time system operation, integration complexity, and ethical safeguards. Detailing these would make the experiment plan more scientifically rigorous and practically executable."
