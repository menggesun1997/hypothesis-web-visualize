    "title": "Context-Aware Ethical Knowledge Graph Fusion in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs inadequately fuse encyclopedic knowledge with domain-specific ethical context, limiting interpretability and reliability in diverse open-domain QA scenarios.",
    "Motivation": "Building on the external gap, this research leverages multi-domain knowledge graphs integrating factual and ethical nodes, enabling LLMs to reason with contextualized ethical information alongside encyclopedic facts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct an integrated multi-domain knowledge graph combining encyclopedic facts with ethical/legal frameworks from health sciences, occupational safety, and supply chain standards. Embed this graph into LLM architectures via graph neural networks (GNNs) to inform answer generation robustly and ethically.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Create domain-enriched knowledge graphs with linked ethical and factual nodes. 2) Train graph embeddings and integrate into LLM token embeddings. 3) Fine-tune on open-domain QA with ethical reasoning tasks. 4) Evaluate interpretability via explainability metrics and compliance with ethical standards.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'What are the regulatory challenges in green supply chain AI implementations?' Expected Output: A response combining factual knowledge of supply chain logistics with ethical and legal challenges identified in regulations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If graph integration is computationally intensive, use knowledge graph embeddings as side inputs or implement selective graph attention to filter important ethical nodes."

          "feedback_content": "The core mechanism of embedding and integrating multi-domain ethical knowledge graphs into LLM architectures via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) lacks sufficient clarity and technical detail. Specifically, it is not clearly described how ethical and factual nodes will be distinguished, how reasoning will be operationalized within the LLM pipeline, or how conflicts between factual and ethical nodes will be resolved during answer generation. Further elaboration on the fusion strategy, interaction between graph embeddings and token embeddings, and model architecture modifications are necessary to substantiate the soundness of the proposed method and ensure reproducibility and interpretability of the approach. Consider including architectural diagrams or pseudo-code delineating information flow through the combined system to solidify the mechanism's clarity and validity in the next iteration of the proposal. This will also help anticipate potential pitfalls in ethical reasoning integration at inference time, increasing confidence in the approach's foundational soundness and technical feasibility.\n\nAdditionally, discuss evaluation metrics in greater depth for interpretability and ethical compliance to ensure that the chosen strategy will reliably demonstrate the proposed benefits beyond qualitative assertions or anecdotal test cases, making the research more scientifically rigorous and impactful."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty rating as NOV-COMPETITIVE, to substantially boost impact and novelty, consider extending the integration to incorporate a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes for ethical reasoning, domain-specific fact recall, and named entity recognition (NER) across relevant domains such as electronic health records, e-government regulations, and supply chain AI policies. Leveraging reinforcement learning with human feedback on ethical compliance decisions can also enhance the model's adaptivity and interpretability in real-world deployments.\n\nFurthermore, integrating graph-based knowledge representations with generative models in a multi-modal setting – for instance, combining textual and structured KG data – could provide richer context and increase robustness.\n\nBy incorporating this globally-linked combination ('multi-task learning framework', 'named entity recognition', 'electronic health records', 'reinforcement learning', 'e-government'), the research can showcase a pioneering approach that bridges multiple AI subfields, decisively addressing ethical and factual reasoning challenges in LLMs and elevating its competitive edge within the research community."
