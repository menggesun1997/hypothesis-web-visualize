    "Problem_Statement": "Generative AI used in public health misinformation control lacks embedded auditing mechanisms aligned with public health surveillance protocols, risking uninformed or harmful responses in free-text health queries.",
    "Motivation": "Direct gap-filling of the external issue where public health informatics and AI prompt tuning remain disconnected. Embedding surveillance-aware auditing mechanisms ensures accountability and ethical risk mitigation in critical health communication scenarios.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an AI moderation system integrating LLMs with real-time public health surveillance data and audit trails inspired by CDC monitoring strategies. The system uses prompt conditions informed by surveillance signals and logs decisions with traceable metadata for ethical review and continuous feedback.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets of health misinformation and associated public health event data. 2) Incorporate surveillance indicators into prompt tuning to bias responses towards safety and accuracy. 3) Build automated logging and auditing modules. 4) Evaluate for misinformation reduction, response accuracy, and audit trace completeness against baselines lacking these mechanisms.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User query about vaccine safety amid an outbreak. Output: AI gives evidence-based, cautious guidance, with audit logs detailing public health data references and ethical checks passed.",

        "title": "Public Health AI Moderation with Embedded Surveillance Auditing Using Responsible AI and EU Regulatory Principles",
        "Problem_Statement": "Generative AI systems deployed for public health misinformation moderation currently lack a rigorous, transparent, and privacy-preserving embedded auditing mechanism that tightly integrates public health surveillance signals to guide and validate responses. This gap risks producing uninformed, inconsistent, or potentially harmful guidance in free-text health queries during critical public health events, compounded by challenges in handling noisy and delayed surveillance data.",
        "Motivation": "While existing AI moderation approaches address misinformation broadly, few effectively combine real-time public health surveillance data with ethical auditing aligned to regulatory standards like the EU AI Act. Our work advances beyond prior art by architecting a system that not only integrates dynamic surveillance indicators into prompt conditioning with fine-grained traceability but also embeds continuous ethical and regulatory compliance auditing. This bridges a crucial disconnect in public health informatics and AI moderation, elevating accountability, user trust, and practical efficacy in high-stakes health communication scenarios.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular system architecture inspired by Responsible AI frameworks and aligned with EU regulatory requirements, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with multi-source public health surveillance data streams (e.g., CDC, WHO, regional health agencies). Key components include:  \n\n1. **Data Harmonization Layer:** Cleanses and assesses incoming surveillance data for noise and latency, using probabilistic filtering and confidence scoring to manage uncertainty.\n2. **Dynamic Prompt Conditioning Engine:** Embeds surveillance-informed metadata and signal confidence scores as structured prompt additives, biasing LLM output generation toward conservative, evidence-based guidance under high uncertainty.\n3. **Audit Trail Module:** Automatically links each AI response to timestamped surveillance inputs, prompt conditioning parameters, and internal model decision points, all anonymized to preserve user privacy per GDPR. Audit logs enable traceability and external ethical review.\n4. **Ethical Compliance Validator:** Continuously evaluates outputs against embedded ethical constraints derived from international health norms and the EU AI Act, flagging deviations for human oversight.\n5. **User Transparency Interface:** Provides end-users with concise, intelligible explanations of how surveillance data influenced the AIâ€™s response, fostering trust and informed decision-making.\n\nThis architecture tightly couples surveillance signals with prompt conditions and auditing mechanisms, ensuring that moderation decisions are reliably anchored in verified public health data flows, while maintaining user privacy and transparency.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) **Data Collection:** Aggregate and preprocess datasets including crowdsourced public health misinformation, structured outbreak reports (CDC, WHO), and multi-jurisdictional surveillance feeds. Secure data-sharing agreements ensuring up-to-date and legally compliant access.\n2) **Noise and Delay Handling:** Develop algorithms for real-time noise filtering and data latency compensation within the Data Harmonization Layer; evaluate effectiveness on historical outbreak scenarios.\n3) **Model Integration and Prompt Tuning:** Incorporate surveillance signal embeddings into LLM input prompts; calibrate response conservatism through reinforcement learning from human feedback aligned with EU AI regulation guidelines.\n4) **Audit Trail Framework Construction:** Design and implement immutable, privacy-preserving audit logs with metadata schemas capturing decision provenance and ethical compliance checks.\n5) **Evaluation Metrics Design:** Establish quantitative and qualitative metrics for misinformation reduction, response accuracy, audit log completeness, ethical compliance coverage, and user comprehension/trust.\n6) **User Impact Assessments:** Conduct simulated and real-world user studies evaluating system effectiveness, transparency, and user trust, with iterative feedback loops.\n7) **Stress Testing and Fallback Validation:** Utilize synthetic surveillance delay and noise scenarios to challenge system robustness and confirm fallback operation via static ethical constraints and manual audits.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "- **Input:** \"Is the current flu vaccine safe and effective given the recent outbreak alerts?\"\n  \n  **Output:** An evidence-based, cautiously phrased guidance referencing recent CDC surveillance data confirms vaccine safety; audit logs detail data sources, confidence scores, and ethical validation steps, visible through the user transparency interface.\n\n- **Input:** \"Can I trust unverified home remedies being spread on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic?\"\n\n  **Output:** AI provides a clear warning against misinformation, supported by WHO surveillance data demonstrating ongoing variant spread; audit trail links all supporting evidence and flags ethical compliance confirmations.\n\n- **Input:** \"Is it safe to lower mask usage now considering local infection rates?\"\n\n  **Output:** The AI consults regional surveillance signals incorporating latency adjustments, recommends maintaining caution with referenced data, and transparently indicates any data uncertainty affecting the recommendation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If surveillance data streams are severely delayed or corrupted, the system defaults to a robust static knowledge base incorporating internationally accepted public health ethics constraints inspired by the International Union of Nutritional Sciences guidelines and core principles from the EU AI regulatory framework. In this mode, audit trails continue to capture all model outputs and ethical validations, supplemented with manual human audits to ensure ongoing accountability. Additionally, synthetic simulated surveillance scenarios will be employed to continuously test and improve system robustness and failover efficacy."

The method should more explicitly clarify the mechanism of incorporating and aligning surveillance signals with prompt conditions, and how audit trails tightly connect decisions to surveillance data to ensure traceability without compromising user privacy or system transparency. Without concrete architectural or algorithmic design details, the mechanism's soundness remains uncertain and needs strengthening to assure reviewers and implementers of its practicality and correctness."

Key missing elements include specifics on data sources for public health surveillance and misinformation datasets, strategies to handle noisy or incomplete surveillance data, metrics and protocols for evaluating audit trail completeness and ethical compliance, as well as plans for user impact assessment in real-world settings. The plan should also address potential challenges in real-time system operation, integration complexity, and ethical safeguards. Detailing these would make the experiment plan more scientifically rigorous and practically executable."
