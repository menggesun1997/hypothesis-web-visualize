      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) recently demonstrated extraordinary capability in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks including language translation, text generation, question answering, etc. Moreover, LLMs are new and essential part of computerized language processing, having the ability to understand complex verbal patterns and generate coherent and appropriate replies in a given context. Though this success of LLMs has prompted a substantial increase in research contributions, rapid growth has made it difficult to understand the overall impact of these improvements. Since a plethora of research on LLMs have been appeared within a short time, it is quite impossible to track all of these and get an overview of the current state of research in this area. Consequently, the research community would benefit from a short but thorough review of the recent changes in this area. This article thoroughly overviews LLMs, including their history, architectures, transformers, resources, training methods, applications, impacts, challenges, etc. This paper begins by discussing the fundamental concepts of LLMs with its traditional pipeline of the LLMs training phase. Then the paper provides an overview of the existing works, the history of LLMs, their evolution over time, the architecture of transformers in LLMs, the different resources of LLMs, and the different training methods that have been used to train them. The paper also demonstrates the datasets utilized in the studies. After that, the paper discusses the wide range of applications of LLMs, including biomedical and healthcare, education, social, business, and agriculture. The study also illustrates how LLMs create an impact on society and shape the future of AI and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. Finally, the paper also explores open issues and challenges to deploy LLMs in real-world scenario. Our review paper aims to help practitioners, researchers, and experts thoroughly understand the evolution of LLMs, pre-trained architectures, applications, challenges, and future goals.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can respond to free-text queries without being specifically trained in the task in question, causing excitement and concern about their use in healthcare settings. ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot produced through sophisticated fine-tuning of an LLM, and other tools are emerging through similar developmental processes. Here we outline how LLM applications such as ChatGPT are developed, and we discuss how they are being leveraged in clinical settings. We consider the strengths and limitations of LLMs and their potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical, educational and research work in medicine. LLM chatbots have already been deployed in a range of biomedical contexts, with impressive but mixed results. This review acts as a primer for interested clinicians, who will determine if and how LLM technology is used in healthcare for the benefit of patients and practitioners.",

      "abstract": "Importance: The rapid expansion of virtual health care has caused a surge in patient messages concomitant with more work and burnout among health care professionals. Artificial intelligence (AI) assistants could potentially aid in creating answers to patient questions by drafting responses that could be reviewed by clinicians.\nObjective: To evaluate the ability of an AI chatbot assistant (ChatGPT), released in November 2022, to provide quality and empathetic responses to patient questions.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, a public and nonidentifiable database of questions from a public social media forum (Reddit's r/AskDocs) was used to randomly draw 195 exchanges from October 2022 where a verified physician responded to a public question. Chatbot responses were generated by entering the original question into a fresh session (without prior questions having been asked in the session) on December 22 and 23, 2022. The original question along with anonymized and randomly ordered physician and chatbot responses were evaluated in triplicate by a team of licensed health care professionals. Evaluators chose \"which response was better\" and judged both \"the quality of information provided\" (very poor, poor, acceptable, good, or very good) and \"the empathy or bedside manner provided\" (not empathetic, slightly empathetic, moderately empathetic, empathetic, and very empathetic). Mean outcomes were ordered on a 1 to 5 scale and compared between chatbot and physicians.\nResults: Of the 195 questions and responses, evaluators preferred chatbot responses to physician responses in 78.6% (95% CI, 75.0%-81.8%) of the 585 evaluations. Mean (IQR) physician responses were significantly shorter than chatbot responses (52 [17-62] words vs 211 [168-245] words; t = 25.4; P < .001). Chatbot responses were rated of significantly higher quality than physician responses (t = 13.3; P < .001). The proportion of responses rated as good or very good quality (≥ 4), for instance, was higher for chatbot than physicians (chatbot: 78.5%, 95% CI, 72.3%-84.1%; physicians: 22.1%, 95% CI, 16.4%-28.2%;). This amounted to 3.6 times higher prevalence of good or very good quality responses for the chatbot. Chatbot responses were also rated significantly more empathetic than physician responses (t = 18.9; P < .001). The proportion of responses rated empathetic or very empathetic (≥4) was higher for chatbot than for physicians (physicians: 4.6%, 95% CI, 2.1%-7.7%; chatbot: 45.1%, 95% CI, 38.5%-51.8%; physicians: 4.6%, 95% CI, 2.1%-7.7%). This amounted to 9.8 times higher prevalence of empathetic or very empathetic responses for the chatbot.\nConclusions: In this cross-sectional study, a chatbot generated quality and empathetic responses to patient questions posed in an online forum. Further exploration of this technology is warranted in clinical settings, such as using chatbot to draft responses that physicians could then edit. Randomized trials could assess further if using AI assistants might improve responses, lower clinician burnout, and improve patient outcomes.",

Nature reported that GFT was predicting more than double the proportion of doctor visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which bases its estimates on surveillance reports from laboratories across the United States (  1  ,  2  ). This happened despite the fact that GFT was built to predict CDC reports. Given that GFT is often held up as an exemplary use of big data (  3  ,  4  ), what lessons can we draw from this error? ",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but the bar for clinical applications is high. Attempts to assess the clinical knowledge of models typically rely on automated evaluations based on limited benchmarks. Here, to address these limitations, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing medical question answering datasets spanning professional medicine, research and consumer queries and a new dataset of medical questions searched online, HealthSearchQA. We propose a human evaluation framework for model answers along multiple axes including factuality, comprehension, reasoning, possible harm and bias. In addition, we evaluate Pathways Language Model1 (PaLM, a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM2 on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA3, MedMCQA4, PubMedQA5 and Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) clinical topics6), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA (US Medical Licensing Exam-style questions), surpassing the prior state of the art by more than 17%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps. To resolve this, we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, knowledge recall and reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal limitations of today’s models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLMs for clinical applications.",

ChatGPT performed at or near the passing threshold for all three exams without any specialized training or reinforcement. Additionally, ChatGPT demonstrated a high level of concordance and insight in its explanations. These results suggest that large language models may have the potential to assist with medical education, and potentially, clinical decision-making.",

This review introduces the machine learning algorithms as applied to medical image analysis, focusing on convolutional neural networks, and emphasizing clinical aspects of the field. The advantage of machine learning in an era of medical big data is that significant hierarchal relationships within the data can be discovered algorithmically without laborious hand-crafting of features. We cover key research areas and applications of medical image classification, localization, detection, segmentation, and registration. We conclude by discussing research obstacles, emerging trends, and possible future directions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract ChatGPT and its variants that use generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have rapidly become a focal point in academic and media discussions about their potential benefits and drawbacks across various sectors of the economy, democracy, society, and environment. It remains unclear whether these technologies result in job displacement or creation, or if they merely shift human labour by generating new, potentially trivial or practically irrelevant, information and decisions. According to the CEO of ChatGPT, the potential impact of this new family of AI technology could be as big as “the printing press”, with significant implications for employment, stakeholder relationships, business models, and academic research, and its full consequences are largely undiscovered and uncertain. The introduction of more advanced and potent generative AI tools in the AI market, following the launch of ChatGPT, has ramped up the “AI arms race”, creating continuing uncertainty for workers, expanding their business applications, while heightening risks related to well‐being, bias, misinformation, context insensitivity, privacy issues, ethical dilemmas, and security. Given these developments, this perspectives editorial offers a collection of perspectives and research pathways to extend HRM scholarship in the realm of generative AI. In doing so, the discussion synthesizes the literature on AI and generative AI, connecting it to various aspects of HRM processes, practices, relationships, and outcomes, thereby contributing to shaping the future of HRM research.\nKey points  What is currently known?   The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence models has swiftly prompted much academic and media discourse regarding their potential for disruption as well as their transformative power impacting multiple facets of the economy, society, and environment.   Software tools like ChatGPT and other comparable ones utilizing generative AI models can produce incredibly human‐like responses to queries, yet, they can also be profoundly erroneous, raising significant ethical and moral issues, and their adoption by HRM practitioners.     What this perspectives editorial adds?   Provides a comprehensive summary of the advancements, constraints, and commercial applications of generative AI.   Offers 11 perspectives that advance scholarship in HRM and present a collection of unexplored research opportunities for HRM scholars.     The implications for practitioners   Comprehending the possible strengths and weaknesses of implementing immersive technologies like ChatGPT and its variants in HRM strategy, practices, procedures, platforms, and productivity will aid organisations' leaders in critically evaluating its relevance, feasibility to implement, usefulness and potential impact to achieve organisationally valued outcomes.   The lack of regulations heightens the risks and ethical dilemmas associated with the usage of generative AI models, which presents significant threats for organisations, scholarly research, and society at large.

      "abstract": "Transformative artificially intelligent tools, such as ChatGPT, designed to generate sophisticated text indistinguishable from that produced by a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.",

It is freely accessible through a web portal created by the tool's developer, OpenAI. The program-which automatically creates text based on written prompts-is so popular that it's likely to be \"at capacity right now\" if you attempt to use it. When you do get through, ChatGPT provides endless entertainment. I asked it to rewrite the first scene of the classic American play <i>Death of a Salesman</i>, but to feature Princess Elsa from the animated movie <i>Frozen</i> as the main character instead of Willy Loman. The output was an amusing conversation in which Elsa-who has come home from a tough day of selling-is told by her son Happy, \"Come on, Mom. You're Elsa from <i>Frozen</i>. You have ice powers and you're a queen. You're unstoppable.\" Mash-ups like this are certainly fun, but there are serious implications for generative AI programs like ChatGPT in science and academia.",

      "citationCount": 320,

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining\nlarge language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a\nvariety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and\ncognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an\nunprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our\ninvestigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active\ndevelopment by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of\na new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that\nexhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the\nrising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that,\nbeyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that\nspan mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without\nneeding any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's\nperformance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly\nsurpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's\ncapabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet\nstill incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system.\nIn our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its\nlimitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper\nand more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for\npursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude\nwith reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and\nfuture research directions.",
