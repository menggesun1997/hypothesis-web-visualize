    "title": "Privacy-Preserving Curriculum Learning for Continual World Knowledge Updates",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current continual learning for LLMs lacks scalable rehearsal-free methods that prevent catastrophic forgetting while respecting data privacy regulations—critical for sensitive domains like healthcare and finance.",
    "Motivation": "Directly addresses internal critical gaps (1) and external gaps regarding overlooked cross-disciplinary data management and privacy protocols; builds on innovation opportunity (2) by adapting health sciences incremental training curricula and data stewardship principles to LLM continual learning.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a privacy-preserving incremental curriculum learning framework that structures continual learning into modular, low-variance update batches inspired by medical training stages. Incorporate differential privacy mechanisms and federated incremental updates, allowing LLMs to adapt on diverse decentralized data sources without raw data replay. The framework includes knowledge projection layers that reconcile updates with legacy knowledge, reducing bias and forgetting, and automatically prioritize incoming updates based on importance and relevance metrics aligned with data stewardship policies.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect privacy-sensitive domain datasets with temporal splits (e.g., clinical notes, financial news).  2) Baseline comparisons: regular rehearsal-free continual learning vs. proposed curriculum learning with privacy mechanisms. 3) Evaluate metrics: privacy budget compliance, knowledge retention, update effectiveness, and bias reduction. 4) Test federated incremental training across simulated decentralized nodes. 5) Analyze robustness under data shifts and rare event knowledge updates.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Incremental updates introducing new medical treatment protocols with privacy constraints; Output: Updated LLM responding accurately to new treatment queries while preserving privacy guarantees and retaining previous medical knowledge without bias towards recent data.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If differential privacy degrades performance excessively, explore relaxed privacy guarantees with enhanced access control and audit logging. Alternatively, investigate encrypted model updates or synthetic data augmentation to simulate privacy while maintaining continual learning efficacy."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed privacy-preserving incremental curriculum learning framework is compelling, its core mechanisms such as the knowledge projection layers and automatic prioritization of updates need clearer formalization and theoretical grounding. For example, the method by which legacy knowledge is reconciled with new updates to avoid bias and forgetting should be explicitly specified—are these layers parameterized modules, or algorithmic constraints? How is the importance/relevance of updates quantitatively computed in alignment with data stewardship policies? Providing detailed algorithmic steps or a conceptual model will increase confidence in soundness and reproducibility. Additionally, more justification is needed on how modular low-variance update batches are designed and why they improve continual learning efficacy under privacy constraints, beyond being inspired by medical training stages. Clarifying these will greatly strengthen technical soundness and appeal to reviewers looking for clear mechanisms enabling privacy-preserving continual updates in LLMs without rehearsal or raw data replay, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance.\n\nRecommendation: Include pseudo-code or mathematical formulations of the knowledge projection and update prioritization mechanisms, and theoretically argue or empirically demonstrate their effects on forgetting and fairness under privacy constraints before moving to experiments."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The outlined Step by Step Experiment Plan is comprehensive but could face significant practical barriers and ambiguous evaluation criteria that may undermine feasibility. For example, collecting meaningful privacy-sensitive domain datasets with temporal splits (clinical notes, financial news) requires clear data access protocols and regulatory compliance, which are challenging and time-consuming. Moreover, simulating federated incremental training across decentralized nodes may require substantial computational resources and non-trivial infrastructure setups to realistically mimic real-world heterogeneity and network effects.\n\nThe evaluation metrics also need more precise definitions: How will knowledge retention be quantitatively measured (e.g., by downstream task performance, forgetting metrics)? What constitutes effective update prioritization and bias reduction concretely?\n\nRecommendations: Prioritize feasibility by initially demonstrating the approach on publicly accessible privacy-sensitive datasets or well-accepted benchmarks with pseudo-privacy constraints. Define precise threshold criteria for metrics like privacy budget adherence and bias reduction. Consider starting with a smaller scale federated setup or differential privacy settings to validate the approach incrementally before scaling to full decentralized federated learning experiments."
