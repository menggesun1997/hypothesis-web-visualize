    "title": "Self-Adaptive Spike-Timing Plasticity for Temporal Knowledge Retention in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Standard continual learning algorithms for LLMs do not leverage temporal event-driven mechanisms inspired by biological systems to dynamically balance stability and plasticity over varying update timescales, leading to suboptimal retention and adaptation.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by critical gap and innovation opportunity (3), proposes to utilize self-adaptive spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) principles in event-driven neural modules within LLMs to achieve continual updates with dynamic plasticity shaped by temporal context, a novel biological insight application in language knowledge updating.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Augment select transformer layers with spiking neuron modules governed by an STDP learning rule that adapts synaptic weights based on precise spike timing during knowledge updates. Incorporate a meta-plasticity controller that modulates STDP parameters dependent on update recency and importance, allowing the model to temporally gate plasticity and stabilize long-term knowledge selectively. This event-driven update system avoids gradient backpropagation for incremental knowledge changes, reducing forgetting via biologically plausible mechanisms.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement hybrid transformer-spiking architecture with STDP learning. 2) Evaluate on benchmark continual learning language tasks with temporal update splits. 3) Compare with standard gradient-based continual learning in terms of forgetting and adaptation speed. 4) Metrics: retention curves, update latency, plasticity-stability indices. 5) Conduct temporal ablation experiments and meta-plasticity controller analyses.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Updated language dataset reflecting newly introduced slang terms; Output: Accurate model responses incorporating new terms without degrading comprehension of older vocabulary, reflecting temporal plasticity tuning.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If STDP integration is challenging, approximate spike timing dynamics via temporal attention masks or gating functions controlling gradient updates dynamically based on update timing heuristics."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section introduces an ambitious hybrid architecture combining spiking neuron modules with transformers and a meta-plasticity controller. However, it lacks critical clarity on how the precise spike timing will be captured and integrated within the inherently non-spiking transformer layers, and how compatibility between continuous and discrete update signals is ensured. Detailed mechanistic descriptions or preliminary modeling insights are necessary to strengthen the soundness and plausibility of the integration and the STDP learning rule application in LLM contexts, which differ fundamentally in data representation and training dynamics from typical spiking neural networks. Providing architectural diagrams or formalizing the hybrid learning process would greatly enhance understanding and assessment of method soundness and replicability in complex language tasks. This is essential before convoluted meta-plasticity control can be justified as feasible and effective in continual learning scenarios for LLMs, where gradient-based training dominates currently and spike-timing mechanisms are not established. Please elaborate or simplify the mechanism accordingly to improve conceptual grounding and reader confidence in the approach's novelty and validity without excessive assumption leaps or ambiguities.\n\n"

The plan should address how computational overhead, training stability, and integration challenges will be mitigated or benchmarked in practice, especially given the novelty and complexity of embedding STDP rules in LLM layers. Furthermore, progressive evaluation on simpler proxy tasks or simulated datasets could be incorporated as incremental milestones before full benchmark continual language learning tasks to ensure practicality and reduce risk. Explicit metrics related to model efficiency, memory footprint, and training convergence should also be included to validate the tradeoffs of this biologically inspired yet computationally intensive approach. Without these, the experimental framework risks being overly idealized and non-reproducible in typical research settings. Clarifying these methodological details would strengthen the scientific rigor and practical feasibility of the experimental roadmap to realize the proposal's objectives."
