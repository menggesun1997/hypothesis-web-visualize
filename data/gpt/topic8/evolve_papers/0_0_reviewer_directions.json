    "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Semantic Anchoring for Robust Encyclopedic Encoding",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs inadequately synthesize and verify encyclopedic world knowledge, suffering from low interpretability and reliability in open-domain QA, especially when relying on fragmented, domain-specific data.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal critical gap of limitations in synthesis and verification of encyclopedic knowledge by integrating discourse analysis and literary historicity, leveraging hidden bridges between AI and humanities to develop a robust, semantically anchored encoding.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a semantic anchoring framework combining transformer-based LLMs with modules trained on discourse analytic and literary datasets to capture textual historicity, narrative structures, and pragmatic context. This fusion will generate enriched semantic embeddings guiding the LLM’s encyclopedic knowledge representation, forcing cross-validation via humanities-informed constraints.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble datasets comprising open-domain QA benchmarks, literary corpora with annotated discourse features, and encyclopedic knowledge bases. 2) Implement baseline LLMs fine-tuned with standard methods. 3) Integrate a semantic anchoring module trained via multi-task learning on discourse/literary tasks and encyclopedic QA. 4) Evaluate semantic accuracy with novel metrics incorporating discourse coherence and factuality. 5) Conduct human expert evaluation from linguistics and AI domains.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Who was Willy Loman, and how does his character reflect sociocultural ideologies of his era?' Expected Output: A coherent, factually grounded answer referencing both the literary historicity of the character in Death of a Salesman and sociocultural context, with citations and discourse-analytical insight validating semantic depth.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If semantic anchoring underperforms, fallback to modular transfer learning where discourse modules provide post-hoc validation, or pivot to lightweight semantic constraints via handcrafted rules from literary analysis."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a high-level integration of transformer LLMs with semantic anchoring from discourse and literary datasets, yet lacks clarity on how these modules concretely interact or enforce cross-validation. The mechanism by which humanities-informed constraints guide or regularize the LLM's encyclopedic encoding is insufficiently detailed, risking conceptual vagueness and engineering challenges. I recommend specifying architectural design choices, e.g., fusion strategies, loss functions linking discourse features to factuality verification, and how semantic embeddings interplay dynamically with the language model's internal states to reinforce interpretability and robustness. This will strengthen both reproducibility and the mechanistic soundness of the approach, bolstering confidence in its feasibility and contribution to the problem stated. The proposal should also clarify how domain adaptation or mitigation of conflicting signals from literary historicity datasets versus encyclopedic data is handled to ensure consistency in outputs without semantic drift or hallucination biases, which is critical given the complex cross-disciplinary nature of the method. This enhancement is vital before large-scale experimental commitments or resource allocation are justified, as current description risks overgeneralization and underdefined implementation steps that could impair effective validation and impact realization.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screened novelty status as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the rich field overlap, the proposal could substantially increase its impact by explicitly integrating insights and methodologies from the 'field of cognitive semantics' and 'cross-cultural pragmatics.' For instance, embedding cognitive semantic models that capture conceptual metaphors or frame semantics within the semantic anchoring framework could deepen the encoding of meaning beyond literal discourse structures. Similarly, pragmatic constraints from cross-cultural communication theories could assist in disambiguating encyclopedic facts in socioculturally diverse contexts, enhancing robustness and interpretability in OA-QA settings. Such integration would not only address challenges of fragmentary domain data but also broaden the system's applicability and theoretical novelty. Additionally, these thematic augmentations could enable evaluation beyond factuality and coherence—towards assessment of culturally nuanced semantic appropriateness and conceptual alignment, further differentiating this research on global and interdisciplinary fronts. A concrete step is to map cognitive semantic dimensions onto the semantic embeddings and embed pragma-linguistic features as auxiliary tasks during multi-task learning, thereby enriching the current humanities-informed constraints paradigm with well-established linguistic theories and increasing the work's interdisciplinary resonance and conference relevance.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
