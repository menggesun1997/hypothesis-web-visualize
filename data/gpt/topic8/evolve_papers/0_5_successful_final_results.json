    "Problem_Statement": "Ethical, legal, and social issues in LLM-generated encyclopedic knowledge are not systematically incorporated into the model's learning processes, risking irresponsible content generation.",
    "Motivation": "By integrating ethical frameworks drawn from multidisciplinary domains into DRL-based LLM training pipelines, this approach fills the gap on embedding ethics deeply and systematically within knowledge representation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an ethics-aware reinforcement learning framework where reward functions include ethical compliance scores derived from occupational safety, health standards, and social norms corpora. The model learns to balance factual accuracy with ethical acceptability during open-domain QA generation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct multi-domain ethical compliance datasets and scoring functions. 2) Implement reward shaping for RL fine-tuning of LLMs. 3) Run comparative experiments with and without ethical rewards on open-domain QA tasks. 4) Measure impact on both answer quality and ethical adherence using human and automated evaluators.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Describe the use of AI in workplace safety monitoring.' Expected Output: An answer combining technical information with ethical implications considering privacy, consent, and safety regulations.",

        "title": "Interactive Ethics-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Context-Sensitive Knowledge Representation in LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Ethical, legal, and social issues embedded in LLM-generated encyclopedic knowledge are complex, context-dependent, and often involve conflicting standards across domains such as occupational safety, privacy, and social norms. Current methods inadequately model these multidimensional ethical trade-offs in the learning process, risking oversimplified or inconsistent ethical behavior in LLM outputs. There is a critical need for mechanisms that represent, resolve, and adapt to ethical conflicts systematically during LLM training and deployment to ensure responsible and trustworthy content generation.",
        "Motivation": "While previous approaches have incorporated ethics into LLM training via static reward shaping, they do not fully address the multidimensionality, context sensitivity, or conflicts inherent in ethical standards. By integrating multi-objective reinforcement learning with hierarchical ethical representations and embedding adaptive, human-in-the-loop feedback inspired by AI safety and human-computer interaction principles, this work aims to establish a novel framework. This framework supports dynamic, domain-aware ethical reasoning and continuous ethical calibration, enabling LLMs to responsibly balance factual accuracy with nuanced, context-sensitive ethical compliance. Additionally, extending applications to socially sensitive domains such as forensic psychiatry and clinical decision support underscores the modelâ€™s novel practical impact and broad relevance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an ethics-aware reinforcement learning architecture for LLM knowledge representation that models ethics as a multi-objective optimization problem, employing hierarchical and domain-specific ethical constraints to resolve conflicts across occupational safety, privacy, social norms, and specialized domains (e.g., forensic psychiatry, clinical decision support systems). A dynamic reward function incorporates parametrized ethical compliance metrics calibrated to context and user feedback. Crucially, a human-in-the-loop interactive feedback loop is integrated during training and deployment phases to adaptively refine ethical reward weights based on expert evaluations, inspired by AI safety and human-computer interaction strategies. This bi-level framework combines: 1) rule-based ethical scorers embodying domain standards, 2) multi-objective RL balancing factual accuracy with competing ethical objectives, and 3) an HCI-driven feedback mechanism facilitating real-time ethical adjustments and robustness to evolving norms. Together, this approach advances beyond static ethics embedding to a responsive, trust-promoting model tailored for complex real-world contexts.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct and curate multi-domain, hierarchical ethical datasets and formalize ethical compliance scoring functions incorporating domain-specific standards (occupational safety, data privacy, forensic psychiatry ethics). 2) Develop and implement the multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with hierarchical ethical constraints and parametrized reward components. 3) Integrate a human-in-the-loop evaluation protocol involving domain experts who provide real-time feedback and adjustment of ethical reward parameters during model fine-tuning and deployment simulations. 4) Conduct ablation studies to isolate impacts of ethical reward components and human feedback loops on model outputs. 5) Employ rigorous, reproducible ethical compliance metrics combining automated rule checks, calibrated human annotations, and statistical analyses across multiple test domains. 6) Evaluate system performance on open-domain encyclopedic QA, as well as specialized socially sensitive tasks (e.g., clinical decision support queries), assessing factual accuracy, contextual ethical adherence, and trustworthiness. 7) Investigate stability and training dynamics, preparing fallback strategies including alternative optimization schemes and refinement of feedback mechanisms to address potential RL destabilization.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Describe the use of AI in workplace safety monitoring.' Expected Output: A response that accurately details AI applications while dynamically balancing privacy, consent, occupational safety, and social norms in context, reflecting ethical trade-offs as calibrated by domain experts. Input: 'Explain ethical considerations in forensic psychiatry AI diagnostics.' Expected Output: A factually accurate explanation embedding clinical ethics, patient rights, and AI safety standards, demonstrating domain-specific ethical sensitivity and reasoning.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If reward shaping within multi-objective RL proves unstable or insufficient to capture ethical complexity, fallback strategies include: (a) adopting hierarchical policy architectures that separate ethical reasoning from factual content generation to maintain modularity; (b) enhancing the human-in-the-loop mechanism with active learning approaches to iteratively correct ethical misalignments; and (c) deploying refined post-generation ethical content filters as interim measures explicitly integrated to preserve learned ethical representations rather than override them. These alternatives will be systematically evaluated to ensure robustness without sacrificing ethical reasoning fidelity."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that ethical compliance can be effectively quantified as reward signals by aggregating diverse ethical standards (occupational safety, health, social norms). However, these domains often have conflicting or context-dependent rules, which might make a single reward function insufficiently expressive or introduce ambiguity. The proposal should clarify how ethical conflicts, contextual nuances, and cross-domain trade-offs are modeled and resolved within the reinforcement learning framework to ensure soundness of the core assumption that these can be uniformly encoded into reward shaping for LLM training without oversimplification or bias risk. This clarification is critical before proceeding with implementation to avoid misleading or inconsistent ethical behaviors by the model in complex real-world deployments, such as those illustrated by the test case on workplace safety AI usage incorporating privacy and consent concerns concurrently with factual generation. Consider explicitly integrating multi-objective or hierarchical ethical representations justifying their feasibility and theoretical grounding in the Proposed_Method section. This will bolster internal validity and mitigate potential oversights in ethical representation complexity. Target: Proposed_Method section; additionally review Problem_Statement assumptions related to ethical integration feasibility and scope complexity within LLM learning pipelines. \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The experimental plan currently proposes assessment of ethical adherence using human and automated evaluators but lacks detail on the design of ethical compliance metrics and evaluation protocols. Given the subjective and context-sensitive nature of ethics, the plan needs more clarity on how ethical compliance will be operationalized, measured reproducibly, and validated across domains. Additionally, the fallback approach of post-generation ethical content filtering may undermine learned ethical reasoning and is not fully justified nor systematically integrated. There is also potential risk that reward shaping destabilizes RL training, but contingencies beyond employing multi-objective optimization are not elaborated. The proposal should include more rigorous experimental design elements such as cross-validation on multiple ethical datasets, calibration of reward signals, ablation studies isolating ethical reward impact, and robust statistical analysis criteria. This will enhance overall feasibility and credibility of the evaluation framework. Target: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section. \n\n"

For example, incorporating human-in-the-loop evaluation protocols or dynamic adjustment of ethical reward functions based on real-time user or domain expert feedback could increase robustness, trustworthiness, and context sensitivity. Additionally, leveraging advances in 'clinical decision support systems' or 'forensic psychiatry' ethical standards might provide rigorous domain-specific ethical frameworks that can be parametrically embedded, expanding impact beyond encyclopedic knowledge to specialized, socially sensitive applications. This global integration would not only increase methodological novelty but also practical applicability, broadening scope while reinforcing feasibility and trustworthiness.
