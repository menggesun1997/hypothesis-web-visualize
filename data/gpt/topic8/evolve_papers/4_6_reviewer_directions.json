          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines essential components such as provenance recording and user studies, but it lacks details on scalability and evaluation metrics. There is no clear plan addressing how to handle the computational complexity and resource demands of continuous provenance tracking over large-scale LLM training and moderation logs. Additionally, the design and validation of the explainable AI interfaces need concrete user-centered evaluation protocols beyond trust and understanding, such as measuring transparency effectiveness or bias reduction quantitatively. Strengthen this section by specifying measurable success criteria, resource management strategies, and clear user study methodologies to ensure practical feasibility at scale, which is critical for deployment in real-world moderation systems.  Targeted refinements here will increase the scientific soundness and practical viability of the experiment plan, aiding robust validation of the proposed method's benefits and costs within the AI-based content moderation context, which is highly dynamic and resource-sensitive. This detailed elaboration will also enhance reviewers’ confidence in feasibility, addressing possible constraints upfront to avoid risks of untested scalability issues or vague impact assessment methods that often hamper complex socio-technical AI transparency research projects currently competing in the literature space.  Accordingly, prioritize expanding the experiment plan towards defining operational parameters, resource budgets, and explicit quantitative/qualitative evaluation criteria for all major components and user studies, assuring reproducibility conducive to trustworthy AI research norms and accountability demands in socio-technical systems governance frameworks relevant to this theme, preventing the proposal from falling short on feasibility rigor expected at top conferences like NeurIPS or ACL for impactful trustworthy AI contributions in ethical content moderation domains.  This critique maps directly to assessing the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section for pragmatic implementation considerations under feasibility criteria as requested in your review protocol. Please refine it first accordingly to strengthen the submission's foundation intensely before revisiting broader impact extension or mechanistic soundness improvements, which although important, should follow only after securing experimental practicality substantiation given the competitive novelty status reported in the initial screening phase focusing on combining provenance tracking and explainability for AI ethics transparency in moderation systems globally increasingly scrutinized today at multiple levels, inspired by linked concepts like AI governance framework and trustworthy AI in socio-technical system environments globally increasingly sought after by various stakeholders for ethical clarity and auditability requirements in multi-agent socio-technical AI deployment scenarios in sensitive socio-ethical AI application contexts (content moderation is one of these).  Without addressing these feasibility concerns concretely upfront, the proposal risks rejection due to practical vagueness in experiment planning and implementation strategy despite promising motivations and test cases currently described, thus making this review point pivotal and priority one in your revision sequence to sharpen internal quality and reviewer confidence in implementation possibilities and replication prospects within a top-tier conference setting context where reproducibility and impact demonstration rigor stand very high bar currently in the trustworthy AI research field overall globally, enhancing aligned linked concept integration opportunities.  The suggested refinements also enable realistic fallback plan elaboration with probabilistic and summarization methods quantitatively compared during experiments validating cost-benefit trade-offs for practical resource-aware transparency mechanisms implementation relevant in real-world AI system governance.  Summary: Add explicit resource scalability management plans, quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics for provenance pipeline and explainability interfaces, detailed user study design clarifications targeting various stakeholder groups beyond trust only, and clarify fallback plan evaluation strategies as backup within your Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section first to markedly boost scientific soundness and agnostic practical feasibility of your ambitious proposed approach aiming to meet rigorous trustworthy AI and ethical transparency demands in LLM-based content moderation systems at scale, securing a firmer foundation for competing in the highly competitive research landscape characterized in the NOV-COMPETITIVE domain specified by initial novelty screening results in your submission metadata recommendations.  Thank you for addressing this crucial feasibility point with high priority before broader impact strengthening suggestions proceed, ensuring your foundational experiment plan rigor and clear operationalization modern research best practices that promise impactful trustworthy AI transparency outcome embeddings in socio-technical governance frameworks for AI-based systems worldwide increasingly mandated by societal expectations and policy regimes in this domain, which you can then further leverage by connecting to linked concepts suggested as a next critical review step later per review protocol instructions in your final submission revision cycle timeline customary to top-tier peer review events standards today described in your review prompt requirements thoroughly.  Overall, prioritize concretely operationalizing your experiment plan section with resource, metric, evaluation, and fallback specifics next as a critical milestone revision delivered by your submission responding to this review now (targeting Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section)."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and to substantially elevate both impact and uniqueness of your research, integrate concepts related to 'AI governance framework' and 'socio-technical systems' from the globally linked concepts. Specifically, consider embedding your proposed provenance and explainability mechanisms within a comprehensive AI governance framework that addresses not only technical transparency but also socio-ethical accountability and stakeholder participatory processes. Such integration could involve creating interfaces that support multiple stakeholders’ roles (e.g., moderators, auditors, affected users) and link provenance data to governance policies and compliance checks dynamically, enabling audit trails that satisfy regulatory or corporate accountability standards. Additionally, frame your transparency tools within the wider socio-technical context emphasizing how organizational practices, human factors, and regulatory requirements co-evolve with your technical contributions. This broader framing and integration can help differentiate your work from existing provenance-explainability approaches that focus narrowly on technical aspects, thereby enhancing the practical impact and adoption potential of your solution in real-world AI-based content moderation ecosystems. This will also respond to current calls in trustworthy AI and AI governance research communities for holistic transparency mechanisms that connect explainability with governance and socio-ethical system considerations, aligning your work with trending interdisciplinary frontiers in AI research and policy. Hence, expanding from a primarily technical provenance pipeline and user interface focus toward embedding within AI governance and socio-technical system frameworks represents a strategic advancement addressing competitive novelty challenges, expanding your work's impact scope and positioning it more clearly for high-tier publication and real-world uptake. This suggestion maps to the [SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION] feedback code, targeting the overall research idea with cross-concept leverage from your provided globally-linked topics, precisely as your review protocol recommends for highly competitive novelty situations like yours. Please consider incorporating these dimensions in your next revision iteration after solidifying experiment feasibility refinements first.  Thank you for advancing rigorous trustworthy AI transparency research, especially in socially significant application domains like content moderation in large language model systems."
