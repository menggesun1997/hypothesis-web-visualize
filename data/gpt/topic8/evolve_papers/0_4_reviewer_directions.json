    "title": "Narrative-Historicity Embeddings to Enhance Semantic Depth of LLM Knowledge",
    "Problem_Statement": "Semantic encoding in LLMs lacks the dimension of textual historicity, missing out on contextual richness provided by narrative evolution and historic discourse analysis.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external gap via global bridge linking literary historicity and AI, proposing to integrate temporal and narrative context embeddings into encyclopedic knowledge to deepen semantic layers in open-domain QA.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a historical-semantic embedding space where encyclopedic facts are augmented with temporal and narrative context features extracted from curated literary and historical corpora using time-aware transformers and narrative arc detectors. These embeddings guide LLM generation to contextualize knowledge historically and semantically.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate datasets combining encyclopedic facts and literary-historical annotations. 2) Train temporal and narrative embedding models. 3) Integrate with transformer LLMs via attention fusion layers. 4) Benchmark on temporally sensitive QA datasets and narrative interpretation tasks. 5) Evaluate semantic depth and contextual fidelity with expert human raters.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'How did the perception of democracy evolve from Ancient Greece to Enlightenment Europe?' Expected Output: A nuanced answer referencing evolving concepts contextualized by related literary and historical narratives across time.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If embeddings prove too sparse, fallback to feature extraction and concatenation approaches or limit context to discrete historical periods with manual curation."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section outlines an innovative approach to integrating temporal and narrative context into LLM embeddings, yet it lacks clarity on critical technical details. Specifically, it is unclear how the time-aware transformers and narrative arc detectors will be architecturally integrated with existing LLM attention mechanisms beyond the mention of 'attention fusion layers'. This high-level description leaves ambiguity around how effectively the historical and narrative signals will be captured, preserved, and influence generation. Consider elaborating on the architectural design—e.g., whether these embeddings augment input embeddings, modify attention scores, or function as side information—and provide a rationale for why this fusion is expected to improve semantic depth without overwhelming or destabilizing the LLM's language modeling capabilities. Clear mechanistic insight will significantly strengthen soundness and reproducibility of the approach, and aid in assessing its feasibility and expected impact effectively. This clarity is essential given the competitive novelty landscape and the complexity of historical semantic integration in LLMs. Target section: Proposed_Method."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan is generally well-structured but raises concerns about feasibility that must be addressed to ensure scientific rigor and practical execution. First, data curation combining encyclopedic facts with detailed literary and historical annotations is a major undertaking that may require specialized domain knowledge and significant manual effort; the plan currently lacks contingencies for dataset quality, scale, or annotation consistency. Second, metrics for 'semantic depth' and 'contextual fidelity' evaluated by expert human raters need specification—are these rating schemas validated or standardized? The integration of temporal and narrative embeddings with LLMs via attention fusion layers calls for ablation studies and baseline comparisons to isolate contribution and avoid confounding. Lastly, temporally sensitive QA and narrative interpretation tasks are ambitious benchmarks—clarify if off-the-shelf datasets suffices or new benchmarks will be created, which impacts timelines and resource allocation. Improving detail here will enhance feasibility by highlighting resource needs, evaluation criteria, and robustness checks. Target section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan."
