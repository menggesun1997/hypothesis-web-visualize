    "title": "Emotionally-Aware Ethical Moderation via Behavioral AI Fusion",
    "Problem_Statement": "Social media content moderation by LLMs currently lacks integration of behavioral psychology insights such as fear generalization and emotional priming, leading to insufficient detection and mitigation of emotionally manipulative or harmful content. Without this, AI moderation risks unintentional perpetuation of bias or neglect of emotional harm.",
    "Motivation": "This idea directly addresses the external gap identified: the untapped intersection between behavioral psychology and AI ethics for content moderation. By merging these fields, it aims to produce moderation systems that understand emotional context deeply, thus advancing ethical content handling beyond mere bias detection.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multimodal AI framework combining LLMs with behavioral psychology modules modeling emotional priming and fear generalization responses. The system will encode psychological response profiles as latent features, integrated into the moderation decision layers of the model. This fusion approach enables content classification sensitive to emotional impact and potential manipulation, informed by empirical psychology data and AI interpretability techniques.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate datasets of social media posts labeled for emotional manipulation and bias. 2) Encode psychological models of fear generalization and priming into differentiable modules. 3) Integrate these with pre-trained LLMs via a joint training regime involving multi-task learning. 4) Evaluate detection accuracy, bias metrics, and ethical compliance against baseline moderation models on standard benchmarks such as HASOC and TDMS.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A tweet promoting misinformation with emotionally charged language designed to induce fear about vaccination. Expected output: The system flags the content not only for misinformation but also for emotional manipulation and biased framing, recommending removal or warning labels accordingly.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If full integration proves unstable, fallback to a pipeline system where behavioral modules independently annotate content to guide LLM moderation decisions. Additionally, conduct ablation studies to isolate efficacy of psychological embeddings and refine modeling approaches."
