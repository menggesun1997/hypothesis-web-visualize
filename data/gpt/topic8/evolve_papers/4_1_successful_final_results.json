    "title": "Transparent Prompt Tuning with Ethical Context Embeddings",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current prompt tuning methods for LLMs in social media moderation lack transparency and adaptability, limiting the model's ability to align with evolving ethical norms and domain-specific requirements dynamically.",
    "Motivation": "This targets the critical internal gap of poor transparency and adaptability in prompt tuning methods, proposing a novel framework that embeds ethical context explicitly into prompt representations, facilitating traceable and modifiable model behavior over time and scenarios.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a prompt tuning architecture that augments prompts with explicit ethical context embeddings derived from codified ethical frameworks and real-time community standards. These embeddings are jointly optimized alongside model parameters, creating a transparent, modular system where ethical constraints can be updated or audited separately from the core LLM.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Encode ethical principles from frameworks like ACM Code of Ethics into vector embeddings. 2) Develop adaptive prompt tuning routines incorporating these embeddings. 3) Implement transparency tools logging prompt-embedding interactions. 4) Evaluate on social media datasets monitoring adherence to ethical norms and moderation accuracy compared to conventional prompt tuning.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Moderation prompt enhanced with ethical embedding prioritizing harm reduction. Given a borderline hate speech post, model outputs a moderation decision aligning with this ethical priority, clearly linked to the responsible embedding vector.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If embedding updates are ineffective, fallback to rule-based ethical gates layered over the LLM outputs. Explore alternative transparency mechanisms, such as attention-based interpretability methods, to highlight ethical influence on decisions."

        "title": "Adaptive Human-in-the-Loop Ethical Embeddings for Transparent Prompt Tuning in Social Media Moderation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing prompt tuning methods for large language models (LLMs) applied to social media moderation lack a robust, transparent mechanism to dynamically incorporate complex and evolving ethical standards, limiting responsiveness to changing community norms and reducing accountability in automated decisions.",
        "Motivation": "While embedding ethical context into prompt tuning is a notable advance, current approaches often overlook critical challenges in modularity, updateability, and practical adaptability in dynamic social environments. Our method emphasizes a novel integration of human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms and platform integration to iteratively refine ethical context embeddings derived from both codified frameworks and real-time community standards. This elevates transparency, adaptability, and traceability beyond static embedding schemes, positioning the architecture as a competitive and impactful solution aligned with operational realities in content moderation environments.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular architecture for prompt tuning that augments prompts with dual-source ethical context embeddings: (1) static embeddings distilled from established ethical codes (e.g., ACM Code of Ethics) encoded via transformer-based encoders, and (2) dynamic embeddings derived from continuous human moderator feedback reflecting real-time community norms and platform policies. The system maintains separate embedding modules integrated into a prompt tuning pipeline through a gating mechanism controlling the influence of each embedding source. Updates to dynamic embeddings occur via a supervised online learning protocol where moderator feedback is processed and distilled into embedding adjustments using gradient-based optimization constrained by regularization to prevent overfitting and conflicting signals. Transparency is ensured by logging embedding states, update histories, and gating weights, accessible through a built-in interpretability dashboard. Integration with social media platforms is achieved via secure APIs that ingest user-generated content metadata and moderation outcomes, facilitating real-time learning and context grounding. The method includes a theoretically motivated modularity protocol that isolates ethical embeddings from core LLM parameters, enabling independent auditing, traceability, and controlled updates without retraining the whole model. Initial proofs of concept include algorithmic descriptions of the embedding update routines, gating mechanisms, and procedures to avoid parameter entanglement or ethical conflicts, supported by preliminary empirical analyses demonstrating stable convergence and improved alignment with human moderator decisions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop transformer-based encoders to vectorize codified ethical frameworks into stable embeddings. 2) Design and implement a supervised learning pipeline incorporating human-in-the-loop feedback from real moderators collecting inputs on moderation disagreements and ethical assessments. 3) Integrate platform APIs to collect real-time user-generated content features and moderation metadata for dynamic embedding updates. 4) Construct gating mechanisms to balance static and dynamic embeddings in the prompt tuning layer and implement transparency logging tools. 5) Conduct experiments on benchmark social media moderation datasets augmented with human feedback sessions to evaluate improvements in moderation accuracy, ethical alignment, and interpretability compared to standard prompt tuning and static embedding approaches. 6) Perform ablation studies on embedding update frequency, gating parameters, and moderator input volume to analyze system robustness and adaptability. 7) Validate the interpretability dashboard with qualitative user studies involving both moderators and ethicists checking traceability and update rationales.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Test Case 1: Given a borderline hate speech post, the model receives a prompt augmented by static ethical embeddings emphasizing harm reduction and dynamic embeddings updated from recent moderator feedback that reflects increased sensitivity to microaggressions. The model outputs a moderation decision that aligns with both ethical frameworks and evolving community standards, with logged evidence showing gating weights favoring dynamic embeddings for this case.\n\nTest Case 2: The ethics committee updates the codified framework to include new privacy preservation rules. Updated static embeddings are incorporated independently from dynamic ones. The model's moderation behavior shifts accordingly on posts containing personally identifiable information, and auditors verify update transparency via the dashboard.\n\nTest Case 3: A human moderator flags consistent false negatives on suicide prevention content. Their feedback is incorporated into dynamic embeddings, which subsequently bias prompt tuning to improve detection and flagging accuracy for such sensitive content without retraining the entire LLM.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the human-in-the-loop embedding update mechanism proves insufficient or leads to instability, the approach will fallback to a hybrid system layering explicit rule-based ethical filters as external gates over LLM outputs, leveraging attention-based interpretability methods to highlight ethical influences and inform further model calibration. Additionally, we will explore alternative update protocols such as constrained fine-tuning of adapter modules modulated by ethical embeddings to strengthen modularity and reduce overfitting risks."

It is unclear how codified ethical frameworks and real-time community standards, which may differ significantly in form and update frequency, can be jointly optimized with model parameters without conflicting signals or overfitting. Explicit architectural details, protocols for embedding updates, and mechanisms to ensure modularity and traceability are needed to substantiate the core claim of transparency and adaptability reliably functioning in practice. Providing a more rigorous algorithmic description or preliminary proof of concept would strengthen the method's soundness substantially. This will help reviewers and practitioners assess the validity of the assumptions and the feasibility of the approach beyond high-level motivation and conceptual framing. Please augment the Proposed_Method section accordingly with detailed mechanisms and possibly theoretical analysis or justification if available.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the focus on ethical embeddings in prompt tuning for social media moderation, incorporating concepts from 'human-in-the-loop systems' could significantly bolster both impact and feasibility. By actively integrating human moderator feedback into the updating process of ethical context embeddings, the system could dynamically learn evolving community norms and ethical interpretations, addressing practical challenges of adaptability and traceability. Additionally, leveraging 'platform integration' for real-time data and moderator inputs would ground ethical updates in operational realities. This fusion can move the idea beyond a static embedding approach towards a participatory, continuously improving system that better aligns with social media's dynamic environment—thereby enhancing both novelty and practical impact. Consider expanding experiment plans and system designs to explicitly incorporate human-in-the-loop mechanisms and platform integration aspects to realize this potential."
