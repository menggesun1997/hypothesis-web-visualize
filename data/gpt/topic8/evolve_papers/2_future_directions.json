        "title": "Neuro-Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Dynamic Knowledge Assimilation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods rely on static evaluation protocols that inadequately capture the dynamic evolution of LLMs' knowledge as they interact with continually updated world information. This represents a challenge for accurately assessing and improving factuality and bias mitigation in real-time knowledge acquisition.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap of over-reliance on static and retrospective methods and aims to operationalize the high-potential opportunity of cognitive neuroscience-inspired evaluation frameworks by integrating temporal dynamics and psychological constructs into RAG evaluation protocols.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a neuro-adaptive framework leveraging simulated ecological momentary assessment (EMA) paradigms aligned with functional neuroimaging-inspired latent state tracking to monitor LLM internal states during retrieval interaction. The architecture encodes retrieval queries and sources into psychologically interpretable latent features modeled after medial prefrontal cortex activity patterns related to self-perception. These latent features modulate the LLM's generation process dynamically to reflect updated world knowledge and evolving bias profiles, with online bias measurement and correction loops.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compile a temporal knowledge-update dataset simulating real-world news and fact changes. 2) Implement baseline LLMs with standard RAG pipelines. 3) Integrate the proposed latent state tracking using transformer-based encodings simulating neural activation patterns. 4) Develop an evaluation metric suite combining traditional NLP benchmarks with psychological validity indicators (e.g., bias scores over time, factuality drift). 5) Run experiments comparing static versus neuro-adaptive RAG on datasets. 6) Analyze results for improvement in dynamic factuality retention and bias stabilization.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What is the current status of Mars colonization efforts as of today?\" with retrieval indexing including recent discoveries and mission updates. Output: An answer referencing the latest rover missions, incorporating retrieval-augmented data, with confidence and bias assessments indicating temporal knowledge consistency and minimized hallucinations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If neuro-inspired latent features fail to improve evaluation sensitivity, pivot to integrating psychometric personality trait embeddings directly into retrieval query scoring to modulate source trustworthiness, combined with user feedback loops for incremental improvement."

        "title": "Psychologically-Grounded Bias-Aware Retrieval Filters for LLM Knowledge Updating",
        "Problem_Statement": "Retrieval-augmented models risk amplifying embedded psychological and social biases, yet current augmentation modules lack mechanisms to actively monitor and mitigate bias during retrieval and generation stages.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal critical gap on psychological and social biases under-addressed in RAG and exploits the innovation opportunity to integrate personality and political bias constructs into retrieval controls to reduce bias propagation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a bias-aware retrieval filter pipeline incorporating psychometric trait estimators trained on labeled datasets mapping retrieval sources to bias indicators. This module dynamically weights retrieval results by estimated bias profiles aligning with dark trait and political bias metrics, promoting balanced source selection. The framework also adapts retrieval weights based on personality profiles extracted from conversational context, facilitating personalized bias mitigation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather a multi-source corpus annotated for political bias, personality traits, and social biases. 2) Train classifiers/predictors to estimate bias profiles at document and query levels. 3) Integrate these predictors into a retrieval engine to re-rank results. 4) Deploy the system with an LLM pipeline and compare output bias metrics to baseline RAG without filters using standard bias benchmarks (e.g., StereoSet, BBQ). 5) Conduct ablation studies evaluating impact of each psychological trait on model output quality.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Summarize recent news on climate policy.\" Expected: Output synthesized from retrieval sources re-ranked to balance liberal and conservative perspectives, with minimized extreme or polarized statements, showing reduced overall political bias in generated text.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If trait-based re-ranking does not sufficiently reduce bias, explore adversarial training of retrieval rankers with bias-discriminators or implement interactive, user-in-the-loop bias feedback mechanisms."

        "title": "Real-Time Human-in-the-Loop Validation Platforms for Dynamic LLM Knowledge Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing annotation frameworks for validating LLM knowledge and updates rely heavily on platforms like MTurk with inherent quality and ecological validity limitations, failing to support continuous real-world LLM knowledge validation dynamically.",
        "Motivation": "This idea directly implements the human-centered interactive systems innovation opportunity, addressing external validity gaps and bridging cognitive psychology with practical systems to improve annotation efficiency and trustworthiness in real-time knowledge updating.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Build a hybrid AI-human collaborative platform where a retrieval-augmented LLM proposes knowledge updates, crowdsourced annotators with expert validation and cognitive load monitoring validate the information. Augmented validity indicators, such as annotation confidence calibrated by cognitive psychology metrics (e.g., reaction time, decision consistency), inform quality control dynamically. The platform integrates naturalistic experimental designs to measure ecological validity of the knowledge updates and annotation process.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Design a knowledge update scene dataset that reflects real-time world changes (e.g., breaking news, scientific updates). 2) Recruit annotators and design cognitive load measurement tools. 3) Deploy the platform to capture annotations, confidence scores, and timing. 4) Compare annotation quality and speed with MTurk-based baselines. 5) Measure resultant LLM update fidelity and trustworthiness using evaluation benchmarks and user trust surveys.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM retrieves latest vaccine efficacy data; annotators validate claims with confidence scores and cognitive load data. Output: A knowledge base updated with high-quality, ecologically valid data and annotation metadata documenting trustworthiness indicators.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If cognitive load measures are noisy or unreliable, fallback to behavioral consistency metrics for validation and incorporate automated quality filters based on annotator performance history."

        "title": "Latent Self-Perception Modeling for Interactive LLM Bias Evolution",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLMs lack continuous self-perception constructs that evolve with retrieval-augmented knowledge acquisition, limiting interpretability of bias evolution and decision-making dynamics over time in interactive settings.",
        "Motivation": "Responds to critical gaps regarding self-perception evolution and hidden bridge insights linking cognitive neuroscience with NLP to improve understanding and control of LLM internal state changes induced by RAG.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a latent self-perception representation module inspired by medial prefrontal cortex activation models. This module tracks LLM’s internal bias and knowledge state changes across dynamic interactions, visualizing and modulating bias drift as the LLM acquires new information via RAG. The module interfaces with generation layers to adapt outputs based on evolving internal self-assessment, enabling bias-aware contextual generation and debiasing strategies.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Define quantitative self-perception latent variables inspired by neuroscience literature. 2) Train models to map LLM internal activations to these variables during RAG tasks. 3) Analyze correlations with known bias and knowledge state shifts. 4) Implement modulation layers to adapt outputs based on self-perception states. 5) Benchmark on temporal bias evolution datasets and interactive dialogue tasks.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input conversational history discussing socio-political topics with successive fact updates retrieved. Output: Generation shows bias reduction over turns, with the self-perception module outputting visualized bias confidence scores tracking decline of bias.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If self-perception states cannot be reliably extracted, adopt proxy metrics from sentiment analysis and topical alignment to approximate internal bias states for modulation."

        "Problem_Statement": "Real brain imaging paradigms have not been translated into LLM training and evaluation methods to guide knowledge updating and bias correction during retrieval-augmented generation, resulting in missed opportunities for richer model behavioral insights.",
        "Motivation": "This idea exploits the external hidden bridge opportunity to utilize functional brain imaging paradigms as simulation templates for new training curricula that improve LLM knowledge and bias adaptations, a radically new interdisciplinary approach.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Simulate functional brain imaging patterns (e.g., fMRI data patterns associated with cognitive tasks) as latent supervision signals modulating the LLM’s retrieval and generation phases. Create a brain-inspired curriculum learning approach where the LLM adapts to retrieval-augmented tasks structured like neural activation sequences, effectively encoding knowledge acquisition and recalibration strategies analogous to human cognition.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect open-access cognitive neuroscience datasets with brain activation signatures. 2) Develop mapping layers to convert neural states into training signals for LLM modules. 3) Construct tasks emulating brain state transitions aligned with knowledge updating events. 4) Train LLMs with these brain-inspired curricula and compare to standard fine-tuning on downstream factuality and bias benchmarks. 5) Evaluate model adaptability and robustness over temporal sequences.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM answers frequently updated medical questions; simulated brain signals indicate cognitive control phases during knowledge update. Output: Enhanced accuracy and reduced hallucination rate with faster adaptation to new medical facts compared to standard LLM.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If brain signal simulation proves ineffective, consider simpler cognitive task-inspired training regimes such as dual-task learning or context-switching schedules that approximate neural activation dynamics."
