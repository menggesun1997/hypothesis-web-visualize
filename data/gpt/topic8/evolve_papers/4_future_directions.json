        "title": "Emotionally-Aware Ethical Moderation via Behavioral AI Fusion",
        "Problem_Statement": "Social media content moderation by LLMs currently lacks integration of behavioral psychology insights such as fear generalization and emotional priming, leading to insufficient detection and mitigation of emotionally manipulative or harmful content. Without this, AI moderation risks unintentional perpetuation of bias or neglect of emotional harm.",
        "Motivation": "This idea directly addresses the external gap identified: the untapped intersection between behavioral psychology and AI ethics for content moderation. By merging these fields, it aims to produce moderation systems that understand emotional context deeply, thus advancing ethical content handling beyond mere bias detection.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multimodal AI framework combining LLMs with behavioral psychology modules modeling emotional priming and fear generalization responses. The system will encode psychological response profiles as latent features, integrated into the moderation decision layers of the model. This fusion approach enables content classification sensitive to emotional impact and potential manipulation, informed by empirical psychology data and AI interpretability techniques.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate datasets of social media posts labeled for emotional manipulation and bias. 2) Encode psychological models of fear generalization and priming into differentiable modules. 3) Integrate these with pre-trained LLMs via a joint training regime involving multi-task learning. 4) Evaluate detection accuracy, bias metrics, and ethical compliance against baseline moderation models on standard benchmarks such as HASOC and TDMS.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A tweet promoting misinformation with emotionally charged language designed to induce fear about vaccination. Expected output: The system flags the content not only for misinformation but also for emotional manipulation and biased framing, recommending removal or warning labels accordingly.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full integration proves unstable, fallback to a pipeline system where behavioral modules independently annotate content to guide LLM moderation decisions. Additionally, conduct ablation studies to isolate efficacy of psychological embeddings and refine modeling approaches."

        "title": "Transparent Prompt Tuning with Ethical Context Embeddings",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current prompt tuning methods for LLMs in social media moderation lack transparency and adaptability, limiting the model's ability to align with evolving ethical norms and domain-specific requirements dynamically.",
        "Motivation": "This targets the critical internal gap of poor transparency and adaptability in prompt tuning methods, proposing a novel framework that embeds ethical context explicitly into prompt representations, facilitating traceable and modifiable model behavior over time and scenarios.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a prompt tuning architecture that augments prompts with explicit ethical context embeddings derived from codified ethical frameworks and real-time community standards. These embeddings are jointly optimized alongside model parameters, creating a transparent, modular system where ethical constraints can be updated or audited separately from the core LLM.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Encode ethical principles from frameworks like ACM Code of Ethics into vector embeddings. 2) Develop adaptive prompt tuning routines incorporating these embeddings. 3) Implement transparency tools logging prompt-embedding interactions. 4) Evaluate on social media datasets monitoring adherence to ethical norms and moderation accuracy compared to conventional prompt tuning.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Moderation prompt enhanced with ethical embedding prioritizing harm reduction. Given a borderline hate speech post, model outputs a moderation decision aligning with this ethical priority, clearly linked to the responsible embedding vector.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If embedding updates are ineffective, fallback to rule-based ethical gates layered over the LLM outputs. Explore alternative transparency mechanisms, such as attention-based interpretability methods, to highlight ethical influence on decisions."

        "Motivation": "Direct gap-filling of the external issue where public health informatics and AI prompt tuning remain disconnected. Embedding surveillance-aware auditing mechanisms ensures accountability and ethical risk mitigation in critical health communication scenarios.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create an AI moderation system integrating LLMs with real-time public health surveillance data and audit trails inspired by CDC monitoring strategies. The system uses prompt conditions informed by surveillance signals and logs decisions with traceable metadata for ethical review and continuous feedback.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets of health misinformation and associated public health event data. 2) Incorporate surveillance indicators into prompt tuning to bias responses towards safety and accuracy. 3) Build automated logging and auditing modules. 4) Evaluate for misinformation reduction, response accuracy, and audit trace completeness against baselines lacking these mechanisms.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User query about vaccine safety amid an outbreak. Output: AI gives evidence-based, cautious guidance, with audit logs detailing public health data references and ethical checks passed.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If surveillance data integration is noisy or delayed, fallback to static health ethics constraints with manual audits. Use synthetic surveillance scenarios to stress-test system robustness."
