    "title": "Cross-Domain Ethical Meta-Learning for Dynamic Social Contexts",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs lack generalization of ethical reasoning across the diverse and evolving contexts of social media, constraining their ability to moderate appropriately over different domains and times.",
    "Motivation": "Innovatively addresses the internal gap in model generalization and ethical knowledge application, proposing a meta-learning framework allowing the model to adapt ethical decision-making rapidly based on contextual cues.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a meta-learning system atop LLMs that ingests domain/context descriptors (e.g., community norms, event states) and modulates ethical parameters dynamically. Train on multiple diverse moderation datasets to learn ethical adaptation policies.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Aggregate heterogeneous datasets from varied social media communities. 2) Define ethical context vectors capturing norms and values per domain. 3) Train meta-learner to optimize moderation policy transferability. 4) Evaluate quick adaptation via few-shot tests on novel moderation scenarios.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Moderation query in a niche community with specific cultural norms. Output: Model adapts moderation style preserving both platform rules and local ethical sensitivities.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If meta-learning fails to converge, fallback to modular ethical parameter tuning and incremental domain adaptation techniques."
