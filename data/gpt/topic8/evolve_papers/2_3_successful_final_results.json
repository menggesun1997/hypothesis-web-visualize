    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs lack continuous self-perception constructs that evolve with retrieval-augmented knowledge acquisition, limiting interpretability of bias evolution and decision-making dynamics over time in interactive settings.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to critical gaps regarding self-perception evolution and hidden bridge insights linking cognitive neuroscience with NLP to improve understanding and control of LLM internal state changes induced by RAG.",

        "title": "Multi-Agent Latent Self-Perception Modeling for Robust Interactive LLM Bias Evolution in Retrieval-Augmented Systems",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language models (LLMs) lack dynamically evolving self-perception constructs that can explicitly track, interpret, and modulate internal bias and knowledge states during retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in interactive, multi-turn scenarios. This impedes understanding of bias evolution and limits effective debiasing strategies. Furthermore, single-agent models overlook social cognitive dynamics critical for bias adaptation in complex, multi-agent contexts reflective of real-world deployments.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work explores latent self-perception inspired by medial prefrontal cortex models to track LLM internal states, existing proposals exhibit limited novelty and insufficient experimental concreteness, restricting practical impact. By integrating interdisciplinary psychological theories—including self-awareness, theory of mind, and social cognition—and leveraging multi-agent co-evolution frameworks, we aim to pioneer a novel paradigm where multiple LLM agents with evolving self-perception interact cooperatively and competitively. Incorporating multimodal retrieval inputs and large-scale retrieval advances enhances robustness and grounding. This integration yields richer interpretability, control, and emergent debiasing strategies, positioning our approach as a foundational step toward artificial general intelligence and real-world interactive NLP systems with improved bias dynamics understanding and governance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-agent framework wherein each LLM agent embodies a latent self-perception module inspired by neuroscience and psychological models of self and social cognition. These modules quantitatively represent evolving internal bias and knowledge states via latent variables mapped from model activations and multimodal retrieval contexts (textual and visual). We concretely define these variables using psychometrically-grounded constructs (e.g., bias confidence scores, self-awareness indices) and validate them through proxy metrics and targeted pilot studies. Agents interact in cooperative and adversarial dialogue scenarios, enabling observation of bias co-evolution dynamics. Our architecture includes specialized encoders for multimodal retrieved knowledge, latent state inference networks trained with supervised signals from annotated temporal bias datasets and psychological task analogs, and modulation components to adapt generation conditioned on self-perception states. An iterative scientific workflow with ablation studies, noise-robust training paradigms, and fallback mechanisms grounded in sentiment and topical alignment proxies ensures methodological rigor and practical feasibility. This design surpasses prior single-agent, text-only approaches by embedding rich social cognition constructs, multimodal grounding, and multi-agent emergent behavior analysis within RAG-augmented LLMs.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Define precise latent self-perception variables informed by neuroscience and psychological scales (e.g., self-awareness, theory of mind proxies), validated via pilot studies mapping known bias shifts to model activations and multimodal retrieval inputs. 2) Collect and curate multimodal temporal bias evolution datasets combining text and images with expert bias annotations. 3) Develop encoder architectures to jointly process RAG text and visual retrievals, linking activations to latent variables through supervised learning with noise-robust loss functions. 4) Implement a multi-agent simulation environment facilitating cooperative and adversarial dialogue sessions where agents' self-perception latent states evolve dynamically. 5) Conduct ablation studies to assess individual components’ contributions, noise robustness, and fallback proxy efficacy. 6) Evaluate bias evolution tracking and debiasing efficacy quantitatively using metrics such as bias confidence score trajectories, calibration errors, and social cognition performance analogs. 7) Iterate model refinement leveraging empirical results to optimize latent state representations and modulation layers, closing the scientific method loop. 8) Benchmark final models on complex interactive dialogue tasks reflecting real-world multi-agent retrieval-augmented settings to demonstrate transferability and generalization. This comprehensive methodological scaffolding ensures reproducibility, feasibility, and scientific soundness of our approach.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: Multi-turn socio-political debate between two LLM agents receiving multimodal fact updates from retrieval systems. The self-perception modules output evolving bias confidence and self-awareness scores, visualized per turn to show bias reduction and adaptive understanding. Example 2: Cooperative knowledge-building dialogue with three agents exchanging multimodal evidence, with latent states reflecting emergent theory of mind accuracy and mutual bias modulation. Example 3: Adversarial scenario where one agent attempts to induce bias in another, with self-perception modules detecting drift and triggering modulation layers to maintain calibrated outputs. These test beds demonstrate multidimensional latent state interpretability, multi-agent interaction effects on bias evolution, and effectiveness of modular debiasing conditioned on evolving internal assessments.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct neuroscience-inspired latent variable extraction proves infeasible or noisy, we will fallback to robust proxy metrics derived from sentiment analysis, topical alignment consistency, and psychometric indicators validated through pilot correlation analyses. Further, we will employ simplified interaction scenarios with reduced multimodal complexity to isolate core mechanisms. Behavioral analyses of agent output changes will supplement latent state interpretations to triangulate bias dynamics. Iterative pilot studies and ablations will guide fallback configurations ensuring continued progress despite methodological challenges. This fallback safeguards rigorous evaluation and operational debiasing strategies, preserving research viability while enabling iterative refinement toward the full envisioned framework."

Specifically, mapping LLM internal activations to brain-inspired self-perception constructs is under-specified and may face challenges due to abstract and indirect correspondence. Further elaboration on the exact methodology, data collection, and evaluation metrics for extracting and validating these latent states is needed to confirm feasibility and scientific rigor. Clarify the model architectures, training paradigms, and specific bias and knowledge measures to be used, as well as plans to handle noise and ambiguity in internal state interpretation during interactive RAG sessions to ensure clarity and reproducibility in the experimental pipeline. This will solidify the method’s scientific grounding and practical executability in dynamic LLM interactions with retrieval overlayed contexts, raising confidence in the proposed approach’s feasibility and reproducibility, a critical prerequisite before advancing to benchmarking and modulation steps. Consider pilot studies or simulations using proxy metrics before full neuroscience-inspired latent variable extraction to mitigate risks early on and strengthen methodology robustness and interpretability prior to full-scale deployment and evaluation rounds on temporal bias shift tasks and dialogue benchmarks described in the plan. Detailed methodological scaffolding here is crucial for the community’s trust and for guiding subsequent engineering efforts with large-scale LLMs augmented by retrieval mechanisms, ultimately leading to impactful and verifiable bias evolution tracking and control layers in real-world interactive NLP systems.  ---  Aim to elaborate and concretize experiments with specific data, model, metric, and validation design choices in this section for scientific and practical soundness of your approach’s experimental workflow. -- Consider including a detailed ablation plan and fallback behavioral analyses for self-perception states to establish reliability in varying interaction contexts as a robust feasibility foundation.  Furthermore, explicitly link how empirical results will inform module refinement and gap analyses leading to final model iterations tied to your debiasing objectives to ensure a tight scientific method loop in the workflow outlined here.  Stepwise actionable clarifications addressing these points will significantly strengthen the practical feasibility and clarity of the proposed experimental plan and overall approach evaluation pipeline before advancing into complex multi-turn interactive benchmarks iterations overall carefully managing experimental risk and verification complexity limitations inherent in neuroscience-ML cross-domain conceptual transfers applied to LLM latent states under RAG control schematic envisioned as the method’s core innovation and challenge area potentially requiring iterative design and testing cycles as acknowledged by fallback plans."

This global integration may align your research more closely with real-world deployments and artificial general intelligence paradigms, enhancing practical relevance and foundational significance. Such extensions can differentiate your approach from existing work by positioning it within broader cognitive and social adaptive systems while capitalizing on current strengths in retrieval-augmented LLMs. Concrete action steps might include designing experiments and representations that explicitly model interaction and co-evolution across multiple agents with latent self-perception states, exploring psychological constructs such as self-awareness, theory of mind, and social cognition analogs to inform module design, and evaluating performance in complex cooperative or adversarial dialogue scenarios with evolving multi-agent bias dynamics. These expansions could also facilitate novel debiasing strategies stemming from emergent multi-agent behavior insights and provide richer interpretability and control frameworks for practical interactive NLP applications."
