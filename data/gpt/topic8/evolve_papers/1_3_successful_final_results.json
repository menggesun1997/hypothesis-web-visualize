    "Motivation": "Filling the gap of missing end-to-end explainability frameworks that integrate dynamic semantic grounding for HRI, this project leverages cognitive semantic activation to generate evolving, interactive explanations responsive to interaction progression, enhancing user trust and collaboration quality.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a feedback-driven explainability system that monitors real-time semantic activation states within LLMs during HRI.

        "title": "Dynamic Explainability via Semantic Activation Feedback Loops in Human-Robot Interaction with Virtual Reality Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing Explainable AI (XAI) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) used in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) predominantly provide static or post-hoc explanations that fail to dynamically evolve as the semantic context and user interactions progress. This limitation hinders real-time interpretability, trust, and collaboration, especially in rich, multimodal HRI environments such as virtual reality (VR) simulations and multi-robot contexts where natural language communication and nuanced commonsense reasoning are critical.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work on explainability in LLM-driven HRI has explored static semantic explanations or anchoring concepts post hoc, there remains a critical gap: the lack of end-to-end, real-time explainability frameworks that continuously adapt explanations as semantic activations dynamically unfold during interactions. Addressing this gap is crucial for improving user trust and interaction quality in complex scenarios involving natural language exchanges with simulated or physical robotic agents, including VR-enhanced environments and multi-robot teams. Our approach advances beyond existing methods by operationalizing and explicitly modeling semantic activation states related to commonsense reasoning within LLMs, integrating a closed-loop user feedback mechanism, and embedding these within rich HRI contexts characterized by natural flow and multimodal communication. This combination promises a novel, scalable, and performance-aware solution for dynamic explainability that aligns with real-world HRI demands and outperforms static baselines in transparency and responsiveness.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a comprehensive, modular system that dynamically tracks and updates semantic activations related to commonsense concepts within transformer-based LLMs during ongoing HRI, enhanced via VR-simulated interaction scenarios involving both physical and virtual robotic agents. \n\n1. **Semantic Activation Tracking Module:** This component instruments the LLM's intermediate transformer layers through targeted probes and attention pattern analyses to extract semantic activation signatures linked to a curated commonsense knowledge base (e.g., ConceptNet). We adopt a lightweight architectural modification involving an auxiliary semantic grounding head that leverages contrastive learning to associate hidden states with semantic tokens, enabling near real-time semantic state extraction without compromising inference latency.\n\n2. **Dynamic Explanation Generator:** Utilizing the tracked semantic activations, this module synthesizes evolving explanations that elucidate which commonsense concepts currently influence the LLM's outputs within the interaction context. Explainer templates are adaptively instantiated and updated based on activation changes, with interpretability enhanced through multimodal VR visualizations (e.g., animated concept graphs) that illustrate semantic trajectories during interaction, employing design principles from mimetic and performance art to foster intuitive comprehension.\n\n3. **User Feedback Integration Loop:** User feedback on explanation clarity and relevance is captured via in-VR input channels or natural language responses, which are processed to update the contrastive semantic grounding model and adjust explanation granularity dynamically. This reinforcement feedback loop ensures explanations remain tailored to individual user needs and interaction flow.\n\n4. **Latency Aware Processing:** We implement asynchronous pipelining and bounded semantic data buffering to maintain system responsiveness compatible with interactive HRI latency requirements (~100ms to 300ms), empirically benchmarking these constraints during development.\n\n5. **Commonsense Isolation and Representation:** We explicitly isolate commonsense reasoning components by mapping activated semantic embeddings to a structured commonsense database ontology, enabling disentanglement of task-specific semantics and providing clear attribution of reasoning steps in explanations.\n\nThis approach—integrating real-time semantic probing, VR-enhanced multimodal HRI contexts, feedback-driven adaptivity, and rigorous latency management—constitutes a novel, practically feasible dynamic explainability framework that advances beyond static XAI paradigms and matches complex HRI demands involving natural flow of communication and multi-robot environments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) **Dataset Construction and Annotation:** Collect multimodal HRI sessions within VR and physical robot setups involving natural language commands requiring commonsense reasoning. Develop an annotation protocol detailing commonsense reasoning points, establish inter-annotator agreement methodology, and curate a dataset of at least 500 annotated interaction segments balanced across task complexity.\n\n2) **Semantic Activation Module Validation:** Implement and benchmark semantic activation tracking module standalone to validate accuracy of commonsense activation detection against annotated data. Measure processing latency and scalability on target hardware to ensure real-time responsiveness.\n\n3) **Explanation Module Development:** Develop dynamic explanation generator integrated with semantic activations; perform incremental evaluation of explanation update quality and stability using automated semantic congruence metrics and user proxy models.\n\n4) **User Study Phase 1 - Controlled Simulations:** Conduct controlled user studies with diverse participants interacting with a VR-simulated robotic agent using static versus dynamic explanations. Metrics: trust scales (using validated questionnaires like Trust in Automation), comprehension tests, cognitive load assessments (NASA-TLX), with demographic diversity ensured.\n\n5) **User Study Phase 2 - Multi-Robot, Real-World Scenarios:** Test system in more complex multi-robot physical HRI settings focusing on natural language collaboration tasks, analyzing explanation efficacy in natural flow communication contexts.\n\n6) **Iterative Feedback and Refinement:** Use user feedback from studies to refine semantic grounding and adjust explanation modalities. Benchmark system latency and stability throughout.\n\n7) **Robustness and Generalization Testing:** Evaluate system performance across diverse robotic platforms, HRI task domains, and user profiles to establish generalizability and identify scalability bottlenecks.\n\nThis staged plan integrates technical validation and user-centric evaluation to ensure feasibility, performance, and impact of the dynamic explainability system in realistic HRI contexts.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User commands in a VR environment controlling a simulated robot, \"Please bring me a warm blanket if it's cold outside.\"\n- Initial Explanation Output: Highlights semantic activations related to 'temperature,' 'comfort,' and 'blanket' commonsense concepts explaining the robot's reasoning for selecting the item.\n- Interaction Progression: User adds, \"I just spilled coffee everywhere.\"\n- Updated Explanation Output: Dynamically incorporates new semantic activations for 'spill,' 'cleaning,' and 'safety,' explaining that the robot adjusts its behavior to prioritize cleaning the spill before providing the blanket, with a VR-based animated graph illustrating concept activation shifts.\n\nAdditional Example: In a multi-robot team, user requests, \"Coordinate to clear the dance floor before performance.\" Explanation dynamically reveals semantic activations linked to 'space clearing,' 'dance aesthetics,' 'performance art,' and collaborative task synchronization, visualized in VR to enhance shared situational awareness.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time semantic activation tracking introduces unacceptable latency, we will explore batching semantic updates at short intervals (~500ms) or implementing user-triggered explanation refreshes to balance responsiveness and explanation dynamism.\n\nShould integrating VR multimodal explanation visualizations prove resource-intensive or detract from user understanding, simpler 2D visualization modalities (e.g., concept activation heatmaps) will be employed.\n\nIf collecting extensive annotated interaction data delays progress, we will bootstrap semantic activation model training via synthetic data generated from scripted HRI scenarios and iteratively refine with smaller-scale human annotations.\n\nIn case user feedback loops are insufficient to stabilize explanation quality, we will incorporate offline model fine-tuning using aggregated user interaction logs to progressively improve semantic grounding.\n\nThese contingencies ensure system robustness and experimental feasibility without compromising the overarching goal of dynamic, trust-enhancing explainability in complex HRI environments."

To address this, the proposal should more explicitly define the mechanisms for tracking semantic activations, including any architectural modifications, algorithms for semantic grounding, and how user feedback concretely refines the activation models and explanation granularity. This would strengthen the soundness by clarifying feasibility and reproducibility of the dynamic explanation system in the HRI context, which currently seems underspecified and highly challenging given LLMs' complexity and speed constraints in interactive settings. Consider elaborating with a concrete example workflow or pseudo-code illustrating the feedback loop from semantic activation detection to explanation update and user feedback incorporation. This will also help align expectations on system performance and responsiveness more realistically with current LLM capabilities and HRI demands (e.g., latency requirements). Also, explicitly discuss how the system will isolate and represent commonsense reasoning components in the semantic activations, as these are central to the explainability claims but remain conceptually vague in the current presentation.\";\",\"target_section\":\"Proposed_Method\"},{"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines promising evaluation steps but lacks critical details that may threaten feasibility. Specifically, real-time semantic activation monitoring and dynamic explanation updating in LLMs pose substantial technical and experimental complexity, yet no intermediate validation phases or technical benchmarks on system latency, scalability, and stability under realistic HRI workloads are described. Also, obtaining comprehensive and high-quality annotations for commonsense reasoning points in interactive HRI sessions may be time-consuming and challenging; plans for annotation protocols, inter-annotator agreement, and data scale requirements would strengthen experimental feasibility. Furthermore, user studies assessing trust and comprehension need clearer design—e.g., how will static and dynamic explanation conditions be controlled, what metrics or instruments will be used, and what participant demographics or task domains will be targeted? Without these details, feasibility risks are elevated, potentially undermining the project's impact and scientific validity. It would be beneficial to insert incremental benchmarking or simulation phases before full end-to-end user evaluations to progressively validate core components and uncover scalability or responsiveness bottlenecks early on (step 2 and 3). Overall, more explicit experimental rigor and contingency in the plan will enhance feasibility and success likelihood in this complex, multi-layered system development endeavor.\";\",\"target_section\":\"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\"}]}{"
