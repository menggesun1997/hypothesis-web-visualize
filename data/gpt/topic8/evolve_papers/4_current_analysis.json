Though this success of LLMs has prompted a substantial increase in research contributions, rapid growth has made it difficult to understand the overall impact of these improvements. Since a plethora of research on LLMs have been appeared within a short time, it is quite impossible to track all of these and get an overview of the current state of research in this area. Consequently, the research community would benefit from a short but thorough review of the recent changes in this area. This article thoroughly overviews LLMs, including their history, architectures, transformers, resources, training methods, applications, impacts, challenges, etc. This paper begins by discussing the fundamental concepts of LLMs with its traditional pipeline of the LLMs training phase. Then the paper provides an overview of the existing works, the history of LLMs, their evolution over time, the architecture of transformers in LLMs, the different resources of LLMs, and the different training methods that have been used to train them. The paper also demonstrates the datasets utilized in the studies. After that, the paper discusses the wide range of applications of LLMs, including biomedical and healthcare, education, social, business, and agriculture. The study also illustrates how LLMs create an impact on society and shape the future of AI and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. Finally, the paper also explores open issues and challenges to deploy LLMs in real-world scenario. Our review paper aims to help practitioners, researchers, and experts thoroughly understand the evolution of LLMs, pre-trained architectures, applications, challenges, and future goals.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Large language models in medicine', 'abstract': 'Large language models (LLMs) can respond to free-text queries without being specifically trained in the task in question, causing excitement and concern about their use in healthcare settings. ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot produced through sophisticated fine-tuning of an LLM, and other tools are emerging through similar developmental processes. Here we outline how LLM applications such as ChatGPT are developed, and we discuss how they are being leveraged in clinical settings. We consider the strengths and limitations of LLMs and their potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical, educational and research work in medicine. LLM chatbots have already been deployed in a range of biomedical contexts, with impressive but mixed results. This review acts as a primer for interested clinicians, who will determine if and how LLM technology is used in healthcare for the benefit of patients and practitioners.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Comparing Physician and Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Responses to Patient Questions Posted to a Public Social Media Forum', 'abstract': 'Importance: The rapid expansion of virtual health care has caused a surge in patient messages concomitant with more work and burnout among health care professionals. Artificial intelligence (AI) assistants could potentially aid in creating answers to patient questions by drafting responses that could be reviewed by clinicians.\\nObjective: To evaluate the ability of an AI chatbot assistant (ChatGPT), released in November 2022, to provide quality and empathetic responses to patient questions.\\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, a public and nonidentifiable database of questions from a public social media forum (Reddit\\'s r/AskDocs) was used to randomly draw 195 exchanges from October 2022 where a verified physician responded to a public question. Chatbot responses were generated by entering the original question into a fresh session (without prior questions having been asked in the session) on December 22 and 23, 2022. The original question along with anonymized and randomly ordered physician and chatbot responses were evaluated in triplicate by a team of licensed health care professionals. Evaluators chose \"which response was better\" and judged both \"the quality of information provided\" (very poor, poor, acceptable, good, or very good) and \"the empathy or bedside manner provided\" (not empathetic, slightly empathetic, moderately empathetic, empathetic, and very empathetic). Mean outcomes were ordered on a 1 to 5 scale and compared between chatbot and physicians.\\nResults: Of the 195 questions and responses, evaluators preferred chatbot responses to physician responses in 78.6% (95% CI, 75.0%-81.8%) of the 585 evaluations. Mean (IQR) physician responses were significantly shorter than chatbot responses (52 [17-62] words vs 211 [168-245] words; t\\u2009=\\u200925.4; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001). Chatbot responses were rated of significantly higher quality than physician responses (t\\u2009=\\u200913.3; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001). The proportion of responses rated as good or very good quality (≥ 4), for instance, was higher for chatbot than physicians (chatbot: 78.5%, 95% CI, 72.3%-84.1%; physicians: 22.1%, 95% CI, 16.4%-28.2%;). This amounted to 3.6 times higher prevalence of good or very good quality responses for the chatbot. Chatbot responses were also rated significantly more empathetic than physician responses (t\\u2009=\\u200918.9; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001). The proportion of responses rated empathetic or very empathetic (≥4) was higher for chatbot than for physicians (physicians: 4.6%, 95% CI, 2.1%-7.7%; chatbot: 45.1%, 95% CI, 38.5%-51.8%; physicians: 4.6%, 95% CI, 2.1%-7.7%). This amounted to 9.8 times higher prevalence of empathetic or very empathetic responses for the chatbot.\\nConclusions: In this cross-sectional study, a chatbot generated quality and empathetic responses to patient questions posed in an online forum. Further exploration of this technology is warranted in clinical settings, such as using chatbot to draft responses that physicians could then edit. Randomized trials could assess further if using AI assistants might improve responses, lower clinician burnout, and improve patient outcomes.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'The Parable of Google Flu: Traps in Big Data Analysis', 'abstract': 'Large errors in flu prediction were largely avoidable, which offers lessons for the use of big data.\\n In February 2013, Google Flu Trends (GFT) made headlines but not for a reason that Google executives or the creators of the flu tracking system would have hoped.

Attempts to assess the clinical knowledge of models typically rely on automated evaluations based on limited benchmarks. Here, to address these limitations, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing medical question answering datasets spanning professional medicine, research and consumer queries and\\xa0a new dataset of medical questions searched online, HealthSearchQA. We propose a human evaluation framework for model answers along multiple axes including factuality, comprehension,\\xa0reasoning, possible harm and bias. In addition, we evaluate Pathways Language Model1 (PaLM,\\xa0a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM2 on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA3, MedMCQA4, PubMedQA5 and Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) clinical topics6), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA\\xa0(US Medical Licensing Exam-style questions), surpassing the prior state of the art by more than 17%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps. To resolve this, we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, knowledge recall and reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal limitations of today’s models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLMs for clinical applications.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Benefits, Limits, and Risks of GPT-4 as an AI Chatbot for Medicine', 'abstract': 'GPT-4, a General AI Chatbot for Medicine Chatbots are computer programs with which one can have a conversation.

    "current_research_landscape": "The current research landscape centers on the evaluation and application of large language models (LLMs), particularly generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT and GPT-4, within socially impactful domains such as healthcare and social media moderation. The core problem focuses on the ethical and bias concerns arising from the encoding of world knowledge in LLMs, which interact with free-text queries in healthcare and public forums. Dominant methodologies include transformer-based architectures employing prompt tuning and human-evaluation frameworks to assess factuality, empathy, reasoning, and bias in AI-generated responses. Research has evolved from broad architectural reviews of LLMs to their specific applications in medicine and public social media forums, highlighting both impressive capabilities and key limitations. The central thematic islands—public health surveillance (e.g., CDC, Google Flu Trends), chatbot generalization and programmatic design, and evaluation methods (human evaluation and prompt tuning)—reflect a multidisciplinary effort to understand and mitigate risks while leveraging AI's strengths. AI chatbots serve as critical bridge nodes linking technical advances with domain-specific and ethical considerations in societal applications.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps include insufficient handling of bias and ethical concerns embedded in LLMs when used for content moderation and healthcare advice. Despite advancements in prompt tuning and human evaluation, models still manifest knowledge gaps, potentially harmful or biased outputs, and limited generalization across diverse contexts, as revealed in medical QA benchmarks and social forum studies. The poor transparency of training data and the limited incorporation of domain-specific ethical frameworks remain persistent issues. External gaps identified through global contextual analysis highlight the lack of integration between health surveillance/public health prevention paradigms and advanced AI model generalization techniques. There is an overlooked opportunity to bridge behavioral psychology—specifically fear generalization, emotional priming, and caregiver intervention frameworks—with AI ethics and bias mitigation approaches. Furthermore, AI fairness research has yet to sufficiently connect with human resource management perspectives and societal impact assessments pertinent to generative AI's role in moderation and misinformation control in public digital domains. Additionally, advanced prompt-tuning methods from computer vision and natural language multimodal tasks have not been fully exploited in this domain, nor have data-driven transparency and accountability mechanisms been widely adopted.",

Cross-disciplinary Integration of Behavioral Science and AI Ethics for Content Moderation: Leveraging concepts from psychology (e.g., conditioned fear responses, emotional priming) alongside AI generalization and human evaluation techniques to design AI moderation systems that better detect and mitigate harmful, biased, or emotionally manipulative content on social media.\n\n2. Development of Transparent and Adaptive Prompt-Tuning Frameworks: Drawing on advances in few-shot and zero-shot learning from vision-language models and applying these to LLMs in social content moderation, enabling better alignment with ethical norms and domain-specific knowledge while maintaining adaptability to evolving social contexts.\n\n3. Embedding Ethical and Bias Auditing Mechanisms within Generative AI Deployment in Public Health Informatics: Integrating public health surveillance insights (e.g., CDC approaches) with AI prompt tuning and model generalization to create systems that responsibly handle free-text queries in health misinformation contexts, ensuring accountability and minimizing risk of harm in critical societal domains."
