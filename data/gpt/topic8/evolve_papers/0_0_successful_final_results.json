    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs inadequately synthesize and verify encyclopedic world knowledge, suffering from low interpretability and reliability in open-domain QA, especially when relying on fragmented, domain-specific data.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal critical gap of limitations in synthesis and verification of encyclopedic knowledge by integrating discourse analysis and literary historicity, leveraging hidden bridges between AI and humanities to develop a robust, semantically anchored encoding.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a semantic anchoring framework combining transformer-based LLMs with modules trained on discourse analytic and literary datasets to capture textual historicity, narrative structures, and pragmatic context. This fusion will generate enriched semantic embeddings guiding the LLM’s encyclopedic knowledge representation, forcing cross-validation via humanities-informed constraints.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble datasets comprising open-domain QA benchmarks, literary corpora with annotated discourse features, and encyclopedic knowledge bases. 2) Implement baseline LLMs fine-tuned with standard methods. 3) Integrate a semantic anchoring module trained via multi-task learning on discourse/literary tasks and encyclopedic QA. 4) Evaluate semantic accuracy with novel metrics incorporating discourse coherence and factuality. 5) Conduct human expert evaluation from linguistics and AI domains.",

Expected Output: A coherent, factually grounded answer referencing both the literary historicity of the character in Death of a Salesman and sociocultural context, with citations and discourse-analytical insight validating semantic depth.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If semantic anchoring underperforms, fallback to modular transfer learning where discourse modules provide post-hoc validation, or pivot to lightweight semantic constraints via handcrafted rules from literary analysis."

        "title": "Integrative Cognitive-Semantic Anchoring for Cross-Cultural and Robust Encyclopedic Encoding",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in synthesizing and verifying encyclopedic world knowledge with high interpretability and reliability in open-domain question answering (OA-QA). These challenges are exacerbated when models rely on fragmented, domain-specific, and culturally diverse data sources, leading to semantic drift, hallucinations, and reduced factual coherence.",
        "Motivation": "While existing approaches primarily focus on linguistic or statistical integration, this research addresses the critical gap by leveraging a cross-disciplinary fusion of transformer-based LLMs with cognitive semantic theories and cross-cultural pragmatic constraints to enhance semantic depth and factual robustness. By embedding conceptual metaphors, frame semantics, and pragma-linguistic insights, the proposal advances beyond conventional discourse and literary historicity frameworks, thus situating AI-driven encyclopedic encoding within a richer, interdisciplinarily validated semantic and pragmatic context. This positions the work as novel and competitive by explicitly modeling meaning dimensions and cultural nuance that underlie encyclopedic knowledge representations, strengthening interpretability and generalizability across diverse knowledge domains.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular yet tightly integrated architectural framework with three interacting components: (1) a transformer-based LLM backbone fine-tuned on encyclopedic QA datasets; (2) a cognitive-semantic encoder module trained on annotated corpora capturing conceptual metaphors, frame semantics, and semantic roles to generate enriched, multidimensional semantic embeddings; and (3) a pragma-linguistic constraint module encoding cross-cultural pragmatic features (e.g., politeness strategies, speech act types) derived from cross-cultural pragmatics datasets. \n\nThese modules interact via a fusion layer implementing an attention-based gating mechanism that dynamically modulates LLM hidden states with weighted semantic and pragmatic embeddings. This fusion enables contextual reinforcement and semantic regularization within the LLM's internal representations. To enforce alignment and cross-validation, we design a multi-objective loss function combining:\n- A discourse coherence loss that promotes narrative and structural consistency;\n- A factuality verification loss guided by cognitive-semantic constraints enforcing conceptual plausibility and frame consistency;\n- A pragmatic disambiguation loss minimizing semantic drift by penalizing outputs incongruent with cultural pragmatic expectations.\n\nDomain adaptation is handled through adversarial learning techniques minimizing conflicts between literary historicity datasets and encyclopedic data representations to prevent hallucination biases. Human-in-the-loop iterative refinement protocols further ensure semantic consistency. This design concretely realizes humanities-informed constraints as both input embeddings and regularizing factors tightly coupled with the LLM's encoding, advancing reproducibility and interpretability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compile and align datasets: encyclopedic QA benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions), annotated cognitive-semantic corpora with metaphors and frame semantics (e.g., FrameNet), and cross-cultural pragmatic datasets capturing speech acts and politeness norms.\n2) Develop baseline LLM and separately pre-train the cognitive-semantic and pragma-linguistic modules.\n3) Design and implement the fusion layer with attention-based gating integrating semantic and pragmatic embeddings into LLM hidden states.\n4) Define and implement the multi-objective loss comprising discourse coherence, factuality verification, and pragmatic disambiguation components.\n5) Train the integrated system via multi-task learning under adversarial domain adaptation to align literary and encyclopedic knowledge.\n6) Evaluate system outputs on open-domain QA tasks using enhanced metrics measuring factual accuracy, discourse coherence, and pragmatically informed cultural appropriateness.\n7) Conduct expert evaluations involving AI researchers, linguists specializing in cognitive semantics, and cross-cultural pragmatics scholars, assessing robustness and interpretability.\n8) Perform ablation studies isolating module contributions and fusion strategies to validate mechanistic design choices.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Who was Willy Loman, and how does his character reflect sociocultural ideologies of his era?\"\nExpected Output: A coherent and factually precise response that references the literary historicity of Willy Loman from *Death of a Salesman*, explicates the conceptual frames activated by his characterization (e.g., 'American Dream'), and contextualizes sociocultural ideologies drawing on cross-cultural pragmatics (e.g., economic pressures and family dynamics in mid-20th century America). The answer will include citations, narrative coherence, and explain pragmatic nuances that validate semantic depth, while demonstrating sensitivity to cross-cultural interpretative variations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the full fusion framework proves infeasible, we pivot to a modular pipeline where the cognitive-semantic and pragma-linguistic modules operate as post-hoc validators applying symbolic constraints on LLM-generated outputs. This includes handcrafted semantic rules derived from linguistic theories and pragmatic markers to filter or re-rank candidate answers, thus preserving interpretability and robustness with lighter engineering overhead."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a high-level integration of transformer LLMs with semantic anchoring from discourse and literary datasets, yet lacks clarity on how these modules concretely interact or enforce cross-validation. The mechanism by which humanities-informed constraints guide or regularize the LLM's encyclopedic encoding is insufficiently detailed, risking conceptual vagueness and engineering challenges. I recommend specifying architectural design choices, e.g., fusion strategies, loss functions linking discourse features to factuality verification, and how semantic embeddings interplay dynamically with the language model's internal states to reinforce interpretability and robustness. This will strengthen both reproducibility and the mechanistic soundness of the approach, bolstering confidence in its feasibility and contribution to the problem stated. The proposal should also clarify how domain adaptation or mitigation of conflicting signals from literary historicity datasets versus encyclopedic data is handled to ensure consistency in outputs without semantic drift or hallucination biases, which is critical given the complex cross-disciplinary nature of the method. This enhancement is vital before large-scale experimental commitments or resource allocation are justified, as current description risks overgeneralization and underdefined implementation steps that could impair effective validation and impact realization.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screened novelty status as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the rich field overlap, the proposal could substantially increase its impact by explicitly integrating insights and methodologies from the 'field of cognitive semantics' and 'cross-cultural pragmatics.' For instance, embedding cognitive semantic models that capture conceptual metaphors or frame semantics within the semantic anchoring framework could deepen the encoding of meaning beyond literal discourse structures. Similarly, pragmatic constraints from cross-cultural communication theories could assist in disambiguating encyclopedic facts in socioculturally diverse contexts, enhancing robustness and interpretability in OA-QA settings. Such integration would not only address challenges of fragmentary domain data but also broaden the system's applicability and theoretical novelty. Additionally, these thematic augmentations could enable evaluation beyond factuality and coherence—towards assessment of culturally nuanced semantic appropriateness and conceptual alignment, further differentiating this research on global and interdisciplinary fronts. A concrete step is to map cognitive semantic dimensions onto the semantic embeddings and embed pragma-linguistic features as auxiliary tasks during multi-task learning, thereby enriching the current humanities-informed constraints paradigm with well-established linguistic theories and increasing the work's interdisciplinary resonance and conference relevance.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
