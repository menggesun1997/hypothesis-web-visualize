    "title": "Adaptive Multimodal Ethical Moderation Leveraging Vision-Language Insights",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs used solely on text miss contextual visual cues affecting ethical judgment in social media content moderation, limiting effectiveness when harmful content includes images plus text.",
    "Motivation": "Bridges technical gap by applying advanced prompt-tuning methods from vision-language multimodal tasks to ethical moderation, a largely unexplored direction per the map’s external gaps.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a multimodal LLM system combining text and images, utilizing adaptive prompt tuning strategies from vision-language research. The model learns to attend to visual emotional cues, symbols, and textual semantics synergistically to detect bias and ethical risks with higher fidelity.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect paired image-text social media moderation datasets. 2) Adapt vision-language prompt tuning techniques for ethical moderation tasks. 3) Evaluate on datasets like Twitter images flagged for hate or misinformation combining modalities. 4) Compare against text-only baselines on bias detection and ethical compliance metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A hateful meme image with sarcastic text. Expected output: The system flags the combined multimodal content as harmful and biased, surpassing text-only model accuracy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal fusion underperforms, fallback to separate modality classifiers with ensemble voting and conduct error analysis to inform fusion improvements."

          "feedback_content": "The current Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks detail on the acquisition and annotation process of paired image-text datasets for ethical moderation — securing high-quality, ethically sound, and sufficiently large datasets is critical but challenging. Moreover, the plan should clarify how adaptive prompt tuning will be concretely implemented and measured in this new application context, including ablations or control experiments to isolate the effect of multimodal prompt tuning against simpler baselines. Ensuring clear metrics, statistical rigor, and plans to address potential domain or annotation biases would improve feasibility and scientific rigor substantially. Elaborate on dataset sourcing, annotation protocols, and experimental controls to strengthen this section's feasibility and reproducibility prospects. This will be valuable to validate the approach reliably and compare fairly with text-only baselines, supporting robust conclusions about added value from visual cues and prompt tuning strategies in ethical moderation tasks, which are complex and nuanced in nature. Targeting proximal subproblems like hate memes — which have mixed textual-visual signals — will help ground experiments in practical challenges that truly stress-test the method's promises and limitations, making the experimental plan more compelling and actionable for reviewers and practitioners alike.

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE, the idea can be strengthened by integrating concepts from 'optical character recognition' (OCR) and 'model long-range dependencies' within vision-language transformers in the proposed multimodal system. Specifically, enabling the model to accurately extract embedded text in images (memes, screenshots, etc.) via OCR combined with sophisticated modeling of long-range dependencies across modalities may boost understanding of subtle sarcasm or hateful content that spans text and visuals. Additionally, incorporating 'platform integration' strategies for real-time social media content moderation could increase the system's practical impact and demonstrate end-to-end viability beyond research datasets. Consider also leveraging 'state-of-the-art word embeddings' fine-tuned on social media text to better model nuanced semantics alongside spatial visual features. This global integration approach can highlight a distinctive technical angle and elevate the proposed work above existing competitive methods by addressing key multimodal interaction challenges and real-world deployment contexts.
