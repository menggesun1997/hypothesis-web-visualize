    "title": "Discourse-Linguistic Guided LLMs for Semantic Precision in Open-Domain QA",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs inadequately represent linguistic and psychological aspects of knowledge encoding, limiting semantic precision and pragmatic understanding in open-domain question answering.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gap of underrepresentation of linguistic and psychological dimensions by integrating discourse and cognitive models into LLM semantic encoding, inspired by hidden bridges between linguistics, psychology, and AI.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a layered LLM pipeline where a discourse-psychology-informed module preprocesses input queries and postprocesses generated answers to align responses with human cognitive patterns of information organization and retrieval, enhancing semantic coherence and user relevance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets annotated with discourse structures and cognitive relevance indicators. 2) Develop modules modeling discourse relations and psychological salience. 3) Incorporate these modules around LLMs as conditioning and filtering layers. 4) Evaluate on benchmarks focused on pragmatic understanding and coherence in QA. 5) Implement human-in-the-loop experiments for feedback on answer relevance and clarity.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Explain the concept of cognitive dissonance and its impact on decision making.' Expected Output: A semantically precise answer that organizes information reflecting psychological models, using coherent discourse relations enhancing intuitive understanding.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If pipeline complexity leads to inefficiency, reduce to a two-stage reranking system or employ simplified heuristics derived from discourse markers for post-generation filtering."
