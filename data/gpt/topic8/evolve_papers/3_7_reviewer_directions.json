    "title": "Adaptive Knowledge Replay Synthesis via Graph-Generated Pseudo-Exemplars for Rehearsal-Free Learning",
    "Problem_Statement": "Rehearsal-free continual learning for LLMs struggles to prevent forgetting because of the absence of prior data, yet explicit data replay violates privacy and scalability constraints.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gap (1) and expands innovation opportunity (1) by synthesizing pseudo-exemplars using graph-based knowledge representations to approximate prior data distributions without storing real data, achieving data-free replay guided by knowledge scaffolding graphs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a graph-based generative replay module that learns semantic node embeddings representing prior knowledge during continual updates. This module synthesizes pseudo-exemplar text samples conditioned on graph embeddings, approximating the original data distribution. The generated samples are used as rehearsal priors for incremental classifiers, facilitating stability without real data storage. The system dynamically updates the knowledge graph and pseudo-exemplar generator to reflect new information and semantic changes, ensuring scalable and privacy-conscious continual learning.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Train initial knowledge graph and pseudo-exemplar generator on base datasets. 2) Perform continual learning with incremental updates using generated pseudo-data for rehearsal. 3) Baselines: rehearsal-free without synthetic data and rehearsal with stored exemplars. 4) Metrics: forgetting rate, update quality, privacy leakage assessment. 5) Validate quality and diversity of generated pseudo-exemplars. 6) Study impact of graph quality on synthesis efficacy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: New scientific term definitions added incrementally; Output: Synthesized pseudo-text preserving prior scientific explanations aids the model in retaining old terminology alongside new facts.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If pseudo-exemplar quality is insufficient, fallback to distillation-based regularization from previous model checkpoints or use knowledge embedding constraints as soft targets during incremental training."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section outlines a promising idea of graph-based synthesis of pseudo-exemplars for rehearsal-free continual learning. However, the exact mechanism of how semantic node embeddings translate into high-quality, semantically coherent pseudo-text samples requires further elaboration. Clarify how the graph generative model will maintain text diversity, avoid mode collapse, and ensure that the synthesized data closely approximates the original data distribution. Providing a detailed description or preliminary architecture of the graph-based generative replay module, and how it integrates with the LLM's continual updates, would strengthen the soundness of the method's core mechanism and assumptions about data fidelity in rehearsal-free settings. Without this, the risk remains that pseudo-exemplars may be insufficiently representative, undermining effectiveness and privacy benefits of data-free replay strategies.â€”This is a must-address to validate the claimed method feasibility and novelty in generating reliable synthetic data based on knowledge graphs under continual learning constraints.

For instance, leveraging continuous learning advances in neural network architectures or autonomous system benchmarks for incremental updates can ground the approach in established real-world systems. Moreover, including scalable, privacy-conscious mechanisms from recent autonomous system research could boost practical utility and appeal. Such integration would deepen innovation by combining adaptive graph-based synthesis with cutting-edge neural continual learning, addressing scalability and complexity in real-world scenarios more convincingly.
