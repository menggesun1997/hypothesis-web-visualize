    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs inadequately model argument structure construction, especially bridging linguistic cognitive stages with complex legal argumentation dynamics.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses external gaps by bridging argument structure construction modeling with legal argumentation research via graph attention networks to enhance explainability and cognitive realism in AI language models.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a graph attention network (GAT) framework overlaying argument components as nodes, enriched with semantic role labels and cognitive stage embeddings. This network interfaces with transformer-based models to map latent representations to graph-informed structures that emulate human-like argument processing stages, enhancing interpretability and cognitive fidelity.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build datasets pairing linguistic argument constructions with annotated legal argument cases. 2) Train GATs jointly with BERT-style encoders on argument classification and cognitive stage prediction. 3) Evaluate neural explainability using representational similarity to brain imaging data during argument comprehension. 4) Benchmark performance against baseline transformers on argument classification tasks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A paragraph presenting a legal argument with complex subordinations. Output: Graph representation highlighting argument nodes with cognitive stages and semantic roles, plus an explanation aligning with plausible human reasoning steps.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If GATs fail to capture cognitive stages, integrate neuro-symbolic modules leveraging external cognitive ontologies and logic programming to approximate argument structures."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that graph attention networks (GATs), enhanced by semantic role labels and cognitive stage embeddings, can effectively model the cognitive stages involved in legal argumentation needs stronger justification. Legal arguments involve nuanced interpretive and normative reasoning that may not be captured fully through latent graph representations built primarily on linguistic features. It would be beneficial to provide preliminary evidence or theoretical grounding supporting the cognitive realism claim, perhaps citing psycholinguistic or neurocognitive studies aligned with the graph structure chosen. Additionally, clarify how the cognitive stage embeddings are derived or validated to ensure the assumed mapping mirrors human argument processing stages faithfully rather than heuristically or superficially. This will strengthen the soundness of the foundational assumptions behind the proposed method and its connection to cognitive modeling in legal contexts.\\n\\nIn short, the proposal must better articulate and validate the foundational premise linking GATs and cognitive stage modeling in legal argumentation to avoid overreliance on an unproven assumption that could undermine the entire approach if invalidated. This will also aid reviewers in assessing novelty beyond technological recombination and its relevance to legal reasoning hypotheses inherent in the problem statement and proposed method sections, respectively.\\n\\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the 'NOV-COMPETITIVE' novelty assessment and the rich set of globally-linked concepts touching on judicial models, legal judgment prediction, domain-specific explanations, and transparent AI, the idea can substantially boost its impact and novelty by integrating a multi-agent or neuro-symbolic reasoning framework that explicitly models legal particularities and cross-border legal reasoning nuances. For example, extending the GAT framework to incorporate domain-specific argumentation frameworks and external cognitive ontologies aligned with legal norms (leveraging the mentioned 'process of legal reasoning' and 'legal particularities') can enrich the model's explanatory power and fidelity to judicial decision-making processes.\\n\\nMoreover, embedding Bayesian deep learning components could provide uncertainty quantification in argument stage predictions, aiding transparency and explainability crucial for legal AI applications. This integration across linked domains can elevate impact from purely technical argument modeling toward operationally meaningful legal AI tools supporting judgment prediction and administrative decision-making, thereby distinguishing it from existing competitive efforts.\\n\\nIn summary, the proposal should consider an enriched learning framework that fuses graph-based neural models with neuro-symbolic reasoning, legal ontologies, and uncertainty-aware methods inspired by global concepts, toward a next-generation cognitive and explainable legal AI system.\\n\\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"
