    "title": "Multimodal Cognitive Digital Twins for Enhanced Dementia Diagnosis",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing medical digital twins lack integration of multimodal data and vision-language models, limiting interpretability and precision in dementia care.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap of integrating intelligent digital twins and vision-language models into medical digital twins to improve dementia modeling and decision support systems, overcoming current translational gaps.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a cognitive digital twin framework that fuses multiomics data, brain imaging, and patient behavioral videos processed via vision-language models, combined with interpretable transformer modules encoding cognitive and physiological state representations. The system will leverage cross-modal attention and semantic alignment to provide actionable insights and interpretability in precision dementia care.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multiomics, neuroimaging and video datasets of dementia patients. 2) Pretrain vision-language models on behavioral video tasks. 3) Develop fusion transformer models integrating omics and vision-language representations. 4) Benchmark interpretability via alignment with neurocognitive clinical markers. 5) Compare against single modality baselines using classification metrics and clinician interpretability scores.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multiomics profile + MRI scan + short patient video during cognitive task. Output: Predicted dementia subtype with attention maps highlighting behavioral markers and genetic features relevant to diagnosis.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-modal fusion proves ineffective, revert to dual modality (omics + neuroimaging) with enhanced self-attention interpretability and augment clinical knowledge graph integration to compensate for vision-language deficits."
