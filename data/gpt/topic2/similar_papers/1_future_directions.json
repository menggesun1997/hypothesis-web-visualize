        "title": "Cross-Domain Knowledge Graph Integration for Robust Scientific LLM Reasoning",
        "Problem_Statement": "Scientific language models often fail to generalize and hallucinate when reasoning beyond their fine-tuned knowledge domains, particularly because existing approaches operate in siloed thematic islands without cross-domain conceptual integration.",
        "Motivation": "This research addresses the critical gap concerning the lack of bridge nodes among thematic islands, specifically between complex question answering and material design. Integrating heterogeneous domain knowledge can reduce hallucinations and improve model reliability through interpretable grounding.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel cross-domain knowledge graph fusion framework that constructs a unified scientific knowledge graph by aligning and merging ontology-enriched graphs from complex question answering, materials science, and clinical trial domains. This unified graph will be integrated into transformer LLMs via graph-aware attention layers, enabling enhanced retrieval-augmented generation grounded in cross-domain scientific facts. The framework incorporates graph embedding propagation that respects domain boundaries but enables effective knowledge transfer.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect and preprocess domain-specific knowledge graphs (material properties, drug trial ontologies, question-answer pairs). 2) Develop graph alignment and fusion algorithms to create a unified cross-domain scientific KG. 3) Modify transformer LLM architecture to integrate cross-domain graph embeddings in attention modules. 4) Fine-tune the model on multi-domain QA datasets including material design and clinical trial questions. 5) Evaluate on benchmarks measuring generative accuracy, hallucination reduction, and reasoning consistency across domains. Metrics include BLEU, F1, factual consistency scores, and human expert rating.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'What novel catalysts could enhance carbon fixation efficiency under clinical bioreactor conditions?' Expected Output: An answer grounded in retrieved cross-domain knowledge linking materials catalysis and clinical bioreactor constraints, articulating a plausible hypothesis with references to materials with catalytic properties and relevant clinical parameters.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If knowledge graph alignment is ineffective, pivot to a modular multi-agent system where domain-specific LLM experts collaboratively answer via a controller model. Also, perform ablation on graph embedding integration to isolate failure causes and explore alternate graph neural networks or retrieval schemas."
