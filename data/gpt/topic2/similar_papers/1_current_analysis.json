Modern IDM paradigms integrate advanced frameworks to enable intelligent agents to make effective and adaptive choices and decompose complex tasks into manageable steps, such as AI agents and high-level reinforcement learning. Recent advances in multimodal foundation-based approaches unify diverse input modalities-such as vision, language, and sensory data-into a cohesive decision-making process. Foundation models (FMs) have become pivotal in science and industry, transforming decision-making and research capabilities. Their large-scale, multimodal data-processing abilities foster adaptability and interdisciplinary breakthroughs across fields such as healthcare, life sciences, and education. This survey examines IDM's evolution, advanced paradigms with FMs and their transformative impact on decision-making across diverse scientific and industrial domains, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in building efficient, adaptive, and ethical decision systems.\"}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Generative Retrieval-Augmented Ontologic Graph and Multiagent Strategies for Interpretive Large Language Model-Based Materials Design', 'abstract': 'Transformer neural networks show promising capabilities, in particular for uses in materials analysis, design, and manufacturing, including their capacity to work effectively with human language, symbols, code, and numerical data. Here, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as a tool that can support engineering analysis of materials, applied to retrieving key information about subject areas, developing research hypotheses, discovery of mechanistic relationships across disparate areas of knowledge, and writing and executing simulation codes for active knowledge generation based on physical ground truths. Moreover, when used as sets of AI agents with specific features, capabilities, and instructions, LLMs can provide powerful problem-solution strategies for applications in analysis and design problems. Our experiments focus on using a fine-tuned model, MechGPT, developed based on training data in the mechanics of materials domain. We first affirm how fine-tuning endows LLMs with a reasonable understanding of subject area knowledge. However, when queried outside the context of learned matter, LLMs can have difficulty recalling correct information and may hallucinate. We show how this can be addressed using retrieval-augmented Ontological Knowledge Graph strategies. The graph-based strategy helps us not only to discern how the model understands what concepts are important but also how they are related, which significantly improves generative performance and also naturally allows for injection of new and augmented data sources into generative AI algorithms. We find that the additional feature of relatedness provides advantages over regular retrieval augmentation approaches and not only improves LLM performance but also provides mechanistic insights for exploration of a material design process. Illustrated for a use case of relating distinct areas of knowledge, here, music and proteins, such strategies can also provide an interpretable graph structure with rich information at the node, edge, and subgraph level that provides specific insights into mechanisms and relationships. We discuss other approaches to improve generative qualities, including nonlinear sampling strategies and agent-based modeling that offer enhancements over single-shot generations, whereby LLMs are used to both generate content and assess content against an objective target. Examples provided include complex question answering, code generation, and execution in the context of automated force-field development from actively learned density functional theory (DFT) modeling and data analysis.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Empowering biomedical discovery with AI agents', 'abstract': 'We envision \"AI scientists\" as systems capable of skeptical learning and reasoning that empower biomedical research through collaborative agents that integrate AI models and biomedical tools with experimental platforms. Rather than taking humans out of the discovery process, biomedical AI agents combine human creativity and expertise with AI\\'s ability to analyze large datasets, navigate hypothesis spaces, and execute repetitive tasks. AI agents are poised to be proficient in various tasks, planning discovery workflows and performing self-assessment to identify and mitigate gaps in their knowledge. These agents use large language models and generative models to feature structured memory for continual learning and use machine learning tools to incorporate scientific knowledge, biological principles, and theories. AI agents can impact areas ranging from virtual cell simulation, programmable control of phenotypes, and the design of cellular circuits to developing new therapies.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'A Unified Framework for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Knowledge Graphs: Architectures, Principles, and Clinical Translation', 'abstract': \"This review paper synthesizes the application of knowledge graphs (KGs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, based on two basic questions, as follows: what types of input data are available to construct these knowledge graphs, and what purpose the knowledge graph is intended to fulfill. We synthesize results from existing works to illustrate how diverse knowledge graph structures behave in different data availability settings with distinct application targets in AD research. By comparative analysis, we define the best methodology practices by data type (literature, structured databases, neuroimaging, and clinical records) and application of interest (drug repurposing, disease classification, mechanism discovery, and clinical decision support). From this analysis, we recommend AD-KG 2.0, which is a new framework that coalesces best practices into a unifying architecture with well-defined decision pathways for implementation. Our key contributions are as follows: (1) a dynamic adaptation mechanism that adapts methodological elements automatically according to both data availability and application objectives, (2) a specialized semantic alignment layer that harmonizes terminologies across biological scales, and (3) a multi-constraint optimization approach for knowledge graph building. The framework accommodates a variety of applications, including drug repurposing, patient stratification for precision medicine, disease progression modeling, and clinical decision support. Our system, with a decision tree structured and pipeline layered architecture, offers research precise directions on how to use knowledge graphs in AD research by aligning methodological choice decisions with respective data availability and application goals. We provide precise component designs and adaptation processes that deliver optimal performance across varying research and clinical settings. We conclude by addressing implementation challenges and future directions for translating knowledge graph technologies from research tool to clinical use, with a specific focus on interpretability, workflow integration, and regulatory matters.\"}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Unleashing the Power of Artificial Intelligence in Materials Design', 'abstract': 'The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in materials design is revolutionizing the field of materials engineering thanks to their power to predict material properties, design de novo materials with enhanced features, and discover new mechanisms beyond intuition.

In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies-such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks-to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows-namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity-critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Self-Driving Laboratories for Chemistry and Materials Science', 'abstract': 'Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) promise an accelerated application of the scientific method.

This review examines the historical progression and current market of DD alongside the development and integration of AI technologies. We analyse the challenges encountered in applying AI to DD, focusing on drug design and protein-protein interactions. The discussion is enriched by presenting models that put forward the application of AI in DD.

    "current_research_landscape": "The core problem addressed by this research cluster revolves around enhancing the capabilities and reliability of large language models (LLMs) and foundational deep learning architectures, particularly transformer neural networks, to support complex scientific tasks such as complex question answering, materials design, and materials discovery. The research focuses on improving generation quality and performance through methods like graph-based strategies, fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, and the integration of AI agents. The thematic islands highlight concentrated efforts in (1) improving complex question answering using transformer architectures and graph-based augmentation; (2) advancing material design and property prediction using AI; (3) automating scientific discovery processes via self-driving laboratories and AI applications in chemistry; (4) applying AI in clinical contexts such as phase II trials for drug discovery; and (5) advancing fundamental machine learning research relevant to scientific inquiry. Dominant methods include transformer-based LLMs, ontology-enriched knowledge graphs, multi-agent AI systems, generative models, and integration of simulation or experimental data (e.g., DFT calculations). These paradigms combine symbolic and data-driven approaches to address domain-specific challenges in science and engineering.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps reveal limitations in model generalization and knowledge recall beyond fine-tuned domains, leading to hallucinations and generation errors, especially outside the learned subject areas. Although graph-based retrieval methods improve generation, there is limited integration of cross-disciplinary learning or effective bridging between AI scientific reasoning and experimental automation. Notably, there are no bridge nodes connecting the thematic islands, indicating siloed research without sufficient conceptual integration across complex question answering, materials science, clinical applications, and machine learning research. Externally, the global GPS analysis uncovers strong but underexplored links between complex question answering and material design or materials discovery, suggesting that embedding advanced question-answering systems within materials science workflows could profoundly enhance hypothesis generation and experimental planning. Similarly, the hidden connection between clinical trials and complex question answering points toward leveraging LLMs for clinical decision support and trial design optimization. Additionally, educational and learning research hidden bridges highlight potential to improve human-AI collaboration and problem-solving abilities in scientific discovery, which remains largely unexplored in this cluster. These gaps indicate opportunities to integrate cross-disciplinary AI-driven interpretive reasoning with automated experimental platforms and applied clinical research workflows, thereby addressing fragmentation and enabling holistic scientific advances.",
