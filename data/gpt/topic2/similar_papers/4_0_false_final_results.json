    "title": "Cross-Modal Vector Symbolic Integration for Unified Concept Representation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current models inadequately integrate vision and language modalities into a unified cognitive representation, resulting in fragmented concept understanding that poorly reflects human semantic integration and cross-modal abstraction.",
    "Motivation": "This project tackles the internal gap regarding modality isolation by bridging vision-language models with vector symbolic architectures, addressing the hidden bridge between human vision and language models underscored in the critical gaps analysis.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel framework termed Cross-Modal Vector Symbolic Integrator (CM-VSI) that encodes multi-modal inputs (visual features and linguistic embeddings) into a shared high-dimensional vector symbolic space. CM-VSI exploits binding and superposition operators to integrate visual attributes (color, shape) with linguistic semantics, leveraging transformer-based vision-language encoders coupled with vector symbolic memory modules. The system learns via contrastive and reconstructive meta-learning objectives to ensure compositionality and symbolic manipulation capabilities across modalities.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect and preprocess paired vision-language datasets (e.g., MS-COCO captions, Visual Genome).\n2. Train vision-language transformer encoders (baseline VL-BERT) for feature extraction.\n3. Implement vector symbolic architecture components for binding and superposition.\n4. Train CM-VSI end-to-end on multi-modal concept formation tasks.\n5. Evaluate on newly designed benchmarks measuring cross-modal concept compositionality, semantic similarity, and interpretability.\n6. Compare with uni-modal and naive multimodal baselines using metrics like accuracy, alignment with human judgment, and symbolic manipulation fidelity.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Image of a red apple + caption \"a ripe fruit\".\nExpected Output: High-dimensional vector representing a concept encoding both visual attributes (red color, round shape) and linguistic semantics (ripe, fruit) with symbolic bindings allowing queries about color, shape, category.\nQuery: \"What color is the object?\" Output: \"red\".\nQuery: \"Is it a fruit?\" Output: \"yes\".",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If integration fails, alternatively train separate modality-specific vector symbolic embeddings and employ a learned mapping function between them. Analyze failure modes by ablation of vector operations and test simpler datasets with fewer concept attributes."
