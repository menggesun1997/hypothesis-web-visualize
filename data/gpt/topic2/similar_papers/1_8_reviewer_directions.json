    "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Graph-Augmented LLM Framework for Reducing Scientific Text Hallucinations",
    "Problem_Statement": "Scientific LLMs hallucinate inaccurate facts when generating complex scientific text due to knowledge gaps and lack of real-time expert feedback.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gaps of hallucination and poor knowledge recall by combining human expert interactions with graph-based knowledge grounding to effectively detect and mitigate inaccuracies during generation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an interactive AI framework where LLMs generate scientific hypotheses or text conditioned on knowledge graphs and present uncertain segments for expert validation. The system incorporates human feedback to dynamically update the knowledge graph and refine generation on-the-fly, closing the loop between AI reasoning and expert oversight.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build a pipeline integrating LLM generation with interpretable graph evidence presentation. 2) Develop interfaces enabling expert feedback input. 3) Conduct studies involving domain scientists to evaluate accuracy improvements and usability. 4) Measure hallucination frequency before and after expert-in-the-loop intervention.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Draft explanation of a novel polymer property. System highlights uncertain claims for expert verification or correction. Output: Revised text with confidence scores and knowledge graph citations reflecting expert input.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time expert feedback is impractical, implement simulated expert feedback using curated datasets for offline refinement. Incorporate uncertainty estimation modules to autonomously trigger feedback requests selectively."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section outlines an interactive framework integrating LLMs with graph-based knowledge and human expert feedback, but the mechanism lacks detailed clarity on how uncertainty is quantified and communicated, how expert corrections dynamically update the knowledge graph in real-time, and how the LLM incorporates those updates during generation. Clarifying the technical pipeline and specifying algorithmic strategies for uncertainty estimation, graph updates, and generation refinement would greatly strengthen the soundness and reproducibility of the approach. Consider providing a system architecture or conceptual flow to concretize these elements for reviewers and later implementers in the community. This will also clarify assumptions about real-time integration capabilities and system latency effects during interaction with experts (Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is broadly appropriate but needs augmentation to ensure scientific rigor and feasibility. Specifically, details are missing about the criteria for selecting domain scientists, how expert feedback sessions will be structured, and quantitative metrics beyond hallucination frequency—such as precision/recall of inaccuracies corrected, time overhead for experts, and user satisfaction ratings—to robustly evaluate usability and improvements. Moreover, fallback simulations of expert feedback should be precisely defined, including dataset selection and validation protocols to ensure that results extrapolate well to real expert-in-the-loop scenarios. Providing a more detailed experimental protocol and success criteria would improve feasibility and credibility of the evaluation."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the existing substantial research on human-in-the-loop and graph-augmented LLM systems, the proposal would benefit by integrating advances from 'Named Entity Recognition' for more fine-grained detection of uncertain or hallucinated scientific entities, and by leveraging 'large-scale training data' to build better uncertainty estimation modules. Additionally, aligning the framework with emerging 'intelligent decision-making' paradigms can enhance expert interactions by prioritizing queries dynamically. These integrations could make the system more adaptive, reduce expert burden, and broaden applicability toward the 'next generation of AI' systems targeting scientific knowledge integrity and scalability."
