    "abstract": "Intelligent decision-making (IDM) is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to automate or augment decision processes. Modern IDM paradigms integrate advanced frameworks to enable intelligent agents to make effective and adaptive choices and decompose complex tasks into manageable steps, such as AI agents and high-level reinforcement learning. Recent advances in multimodal foundation-based approaches unify diverse input modalities-such as vision, language, and sensory data-into a cohesive decision-making process. Foundation models (FMs) have become pivotal in science and industry, transforming decision-making and research capabilities. Their large-scale, multimodal data-processing abilities foster adaptability and interdisciplinary breakthroughs across fields such as healthcare, life sciences, and education. This survey examines IDM's evolution, advanced paradigms with FMs and their transformative impact on decision-making across diverse scientific and industrial domains, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in building efficient, adaptive, and ethical decision systems.",

    "abstract": "Transformer neural networks show promising capabilities, in particular for uses in materials analysis, design, and manufacturing, including their capacity to work effectively with human language, symbols, code, and numerical data. Here, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as a tool that can support engineering analysis of materials, applied to retrieving key information about subject areas, developing research hypotheses, discovery of mechanistic relationships across disparate areas of knowledge, and writing and executing simulation codes for active knowledge generation based on physical ground truths. Moreover, when used as sets of AI agents with specific features, capabilities, and instructions, LLMs can provide powerful problem-solution strategies for applications in analysis and design problems. Our experiments focus on using a fine-tuned model, MechGPT, developed based on training data in the mechanics of materials domain. We first affirm how fine-tuning endows LLMs with a reasonable understanding of subject area knowledge. However, when queried outside the context of learned matter, LLMs can have difficulty recalling correct information and may hallucinate. We show how this can be addressed using retrieval-augmented Ontological Knowledge Graph strategies. The graph-based strategy helps us not only to discern how the model understands what concepts are important but also how they are related, which significantly improves generative performance and also naturally allows for injection of new and augmented data sources into generative AI algorithms. We find that the additional feature of relatedness provides advantages over regular retrieval augmentation approaches and not only improves LLM performance but also provides mechanistic insights for exploration of a material design process. Illustrated for a use case of relating distinct areas of knowledge, here, music and proteins, such strategies can also provide an interpretable graph structure with rich information at the node, edge, and subgraph level that provides specific insights into mechanisms and relationships. We discuss other approaches to improve generative qualities, including nonlinear sampling strategies and agent-based modeling that offer enhancements over single-shot generations, whereby LLMs are used to both generate content and assess content against an objective target. Examples provided include complex question answering, code generation, and execution in the context of automated force-field development from actively learned density functional theory (DFT) modeling and data analysis.",

    "abstract": "We envision \"AI scientists\" as systems capable of skeptical learning and reasoning that empower biomedical research through collaborative agents that integrate AI models and biomedical tools with experimental platforms. Rather than taking humans out of the discovery process, biomedical AI agents combine human creativity and expertise with AI's ability to analyze large datasets, navigate hypothesis spaces, and execute repetitive tasks. AI agents are poised to be proficient in various tasks, planning discovery workflows and performing self-assessment to identify and mitigate gaps in their knowledge. These agents use large language models and generative models to feature structured memory for continual learning and use machine learning tools to incorporate scientific knowledge, biological principles, and theories. AI agents can impact areas ranging from virtual cell simulation, programmable control of phenotypes, and the design of cellular circuits to developing new therapies.",

    "title": "A Unified Framework for Alzheimer’s Disease Knowledge Graphs: Architectures, Principles, and Clinical Translation",
    "year": 2025,
    "citationCount": 1,
    "fieldCitationRatio": NaN,
    "abstract": "This review paper synthesizes the application of knowledge graphs (KGs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, based on two basic questions, as follows: what types of input data are available to construct these knowledge graphs, and what purpose the knowledge graph is intended to fulfill. We synthesize results from existing works to illustrate how diverse knowledge graph structures behave in different data availability settings with distinct application targets in AD research. By comparative analysis, we define the best methodology practices by data type (literature, structured databases, neuroimaging, and clinical records) and application of interest (drug repurposing, disease classification, mechanism discovery, and clinical decision support). From this analysis, we recommend AD-KG 2.0, which is a new framework that coalesces best practices into a unifying architecture with well-defined decision pathways for implementation. Our key contributions are as follows: (1) a dynamic adaptation mechanism that adapts methodological elements automatically according to both data availability and application objectives, (2) a specialized semantic alignment layer that harmonizes terminologies across biological scales, and (3) a multi-constraint optimization approach for knowledge graph building. The framework accommodates a variety of applications, including drug repurposing, patient stratification for precision medicine, disease progression modeling, and clinical decision support. Our system, with a decision tree structured and pipeline layered architecture, offers research precise directions on how to use knowledge graphs in AD research by aligning methodological choice decisions with respective data availability and application goals. We provide precise component designs and adaptation processes that deliver optimal performance across varying research and clinical settings. We conclude by addressing implementation challenges and future directions for translating knowledge graph technologies from research tool to clinical use, with a specific focus on interpretability, workflow integration, and regulatory matters.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in materials design is revolutionizing the field of materials engineering thanks to their power to predict material properties, design de novo materials with enhanced features, and discover new mechanisms beyond intuition. In addition, they can be used to infer complex design principles and identify high-quality candidates more rapidly than trial-and-error experimentation. From this perspective, herein we describe how these tools can enable the acceleration and enrichment of each stage of the discovery cycle of novel materials with optimized properties. We begin by outlining the state-of-the-art AI models in materials design, including machine learning (ML), deep learning, and materials informatics tools. These methodologies enable the extraction of meaningful information from vast amounts of data, enabling researchers to uncover complex correlations and patterns within material properties, structures, and compositions. Next, a comprehensive overview of AI-driven materials design is provided and its potential future prospects are highlighted. By leveraging such AI algorithms, researchers can efficiently search and analyze databases containing a wide range of material properties, enabling the identification of promising candidates for specific applications. This capability has profound implications across various industries, from drug development to energy storage, where materials performance is crucial. Ultimately, AI-based approaches are poised to revolutionize our understanding and design of materials, ushering in a new era of accelerated innovation and advancement.",

    "title": "Generative spatial artificial intelligence for sustainable smart cities: A pioneering large flow model for urban digital twin",
    "year": 2025,
    "citationCount": 13,
    "fieldCitationRatio": NaN,
    "abstract": "Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies-such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks-to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows-namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity-critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.",

    "abstract": "Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) promise an accelerated application of the scientific method. Through the automation of experimental workflows, along with autonomous experimental planning, SDLs hold the potential to greatly accelerate research in chemistry and materials discovery. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art in SDL technology, its applications across various scientific disciplines, and the potential implications for research and industry. This review additionally provides an overview of the enabling technologies for SDLs, including their hardware, software, and integration with laboratory infrastructure. Most importantly, this review explores the diverse range of scientific domains where SDLs have made significant contributions, from drug discovery and materials science to genomics and chemistry. We provide a comprehensive review of existing real-world examples of SDLs, their different levels of automation, and the challenges and limitations associated with each domain.",

    "abstract": "The journey of drug discovery (DD) has evolved from ancient practices to modern technology-driven approaches, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerging as a pivotal force in streamlining and accelerating the process. Despite the vital importance of DD, it faces challenges such as high costs and lengthy timelines. This review examines the historical progression and current market of DD alongside the development and integration of AI technologies. We analyse the challenges encountered in applying AI to DD, focusing on drug design and protein-protein interactions. The discussion is enriched by presenting models that put forward the application of AI in DD. Three case studies are highlighted to demonstrate the successful application of AI in DD, including the discovery of a novel class of antibiotics and a small-molecule inhibitor that has progressed to phase II clinical trials. These cases underscore the potential of AI to identify new drug candidates and optimise the development process. The convergence of DD and AI embodies a transformative shift in the field, offering a path to overcome traditional obstacles. By leveraging AI, the future of DD promises enhanced efficiency and novel breakthroughs, heralding a new era of medical innovation even though there is still a long way to go.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has been pervasively touching many fields of science. Chemistry and materials science are no exception. While machine learning has been making a great impact, it is still not reaching its full potential or maturity. In this perspective, we first outline current applications across a diversity of problems in chemistry. Then, we discuss how machine learning researchers view and approach problems in the field. Finally, we provide our considerations for maximizing impact when researching machine learning for chemistry.",
