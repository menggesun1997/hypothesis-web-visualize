    "abstract": "This survey explores the transformative impact of foundation models (FMs) in artificial intelligence, focusing on their integration with federated learning (FL) in biomedical research. Foundation models such as ChatGPT, LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and multimodal patient interactions. The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges, and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs and FL, laying the groundwork for healthcare innovations.",

    "abstract": "This research is based on three fundamental aspects of successful biosimilar development in the challenging biopharmaceutical market. First, biosimilar regulations in eight selected countries: Japan, South Korea, the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, and South Africa, represent the four continents. The regulatory aspects of the countries studied are analyzed, highlighting the challenges facing biosimilars, including their complex approval processes and the need for standardized regulatory guidelines. There is an inconsistency depending on whether the biosimilar is used in a developed or developing country. In the countries observed, biosimilars are considered excellent alternatives to patent-protected biological products for the treatment of chronic diseases. In the second aspect addressed, various analytical AI modeling methods (such as machine learning tools, reinforcement learning, supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning tools) were analyzed to observe patterns that lead to the prevalence of biosimilars used in cancer to model the behaviors of the most prominent active compounds with spectroscopy. Finally, an analysis of the use of active compounds of biosimilars used in cancer and approved by the FDA and EMA was proposed.",

    "abstract": "Small data are often used in scientific and engineering research due to the presence of various constraints, such as time, cost, ethics, privacy, security, and technical limitations in data acquisition. However, big data have been the focus for the past decade, small data and their challenges have received little attention, even though they are technically more severe in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) studies. Overall, the small data challenge is often compounded by issues, such as data diversity, imputation, noise, imbalance, and high-dimensionality. Fortunately, the current big data era is characterized by technological breakthroughs in ML, DL, and artificial intelligence (AI), which enable data-driven scientific discovery, and many advanced ML and DL technologies developed for big data have inadvertently provided solutions for small data problems. As a result, significant progress has been made in ML and DL for small data challenges in the past decade. In this review, we summarize and analyze several emerging potential solutions to small data challenges in molecular science, including chemical and biological sciences. We review both basic machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, logistic regression (LR), <i>k</i>-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), kernel learning (KL), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting trees (GBT), and more advanced techniques, including artificial neural network (ANN), convolutional neural network (CNN), U-Net, graph neural network (GNN), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), long short-term memory (LSTM), autoencoder, transformer, transfer learning, active learning, graph-based semi-supervised learning, combining deep learning with traditional machine learning, and physical model-based data augmentation. We also briefly discuss the latest advances in these methods. Finally, we conclude the survey with a discussion of promising trends in small data challenges in molecular science.",

    "title": "Leveraging Artificial Intelligence to Optimize Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation for Long COVID Management: A Forward-Looking Perspective",
    "year": 2024,
    "citationCount": 5,
    "fieldCitationRatio": NaN,
    "abstract": "Long COVID (Coronavirus disease), affecting millions globally, presents unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems due to its complex, multifaceted nature and the lack of effective treatments. This perspective review explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-guided transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as an innovative approach to address the urgent need for effective Long COVID management. The authors examine how AI could optimize tDCS protocols, enhance clinical trial design, and facilitate personalized treatment for the heterogeneous manifestations of Long COVID. Key areas discussed include AI-driven personalization of tDCS parameters based on individual patient characteristics and real-time symptom fluctuations, the use of machine learning for patient stratification, and the development of more sensitive outcome measures in clinical trials. This perspective addresses ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and equitable access to AI-enhanced treatments. It also explores challenges and opportunities for implementing AI-guided tDCS across diverse healthcare settings globally. Future research directions are outlined, including the need for large-scale validation studies and investigations of long-term efficacy and safety. The authors argue that while AI-guided tDCS shows promise for addressing the complex nature of Long COVID, significant technical, ethical, and practical challenges remain. They emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, patient-centered approaches, and a commitment to global health equity in realizing the potential of this technology. This perspective article provides a roadmap for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers involved in developing and implementing AI-guided neuromodulation therapies for Long COVID and potentially other neurological and psychiatric conditions.",

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Worldwide, approximately 1.7 billion people are afflicted with musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases, posing significant health challenges. The introduction of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides novel insights and approaches to comprehend the onset, progression, and treatment of MSK diseases. Nevertheless, there is a remarkable lack of analytical and descriptive studies regarding the trajectory, essential research directions, current research situation, pivotal research focuses, and upcoming perspectives. Therefore, the aim of this research is to present a comprehensive overview of the advancements made in scRNA-seq for MSK disorders over the past 15 years. <b>Methods:</b> It utilizes a robust dataset derived from the Web of Science Core Collection, encompassing January 1, 2009, through September 6, 2024. To achieve this, advanced analytical methodologies were applied to conduct thorough scientometric and visual analyses. <b>Results:</b> The findings underscore the preeminent role of China, which contributes 63.49% of the total publications, thereby exerting a substantial impact within this research domain. Notable contributions came from institutions such as Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Sun Yat-sen University, and Harvard Medical School, with Liu Yun being the leading contributor. <i>Frontiers in Immunology</i> published the greatest number of research papers in this field. This study identified joint diseases, bone neoplasms, bone fractures, and intervertebral disc degeneration as the main research focuses. <b>Conclusion:</b> This extensive scientometric analysis provides substantial benefits to both experienced and novice researchers by facilitating immediate access to critical data, thereby fostering innovation within this field.",

    "abstract": "Nanozymes, a new generation of artificial enzymes, have attracted significant attention in biomedical applications due to their multifunctional properties, multi-enzyme mimicking abilities, cost-effectiveness, and high stability. Leveraging these diverse catalytic activities, an increasing number of nanozyme-based therapeutic strategies have been developed for the treatment of various diseases. Despite substantial research efforts, a significant gap remains in comprehensive studies examining the progression, key areas, current trends, and future directions in this field. This study provides a comprehensive overview of nanozyme applications in biomedical research over the past 17 years, utilizing data from the Web of Science Core Collection, covering the period from January 1, 2007, to October 8, 2024. Advanced bibliometric and visualization tools were employed to facilitate a comprehensive analysis. The results highlight China's dominant role in this field, accounting for 76.83 % of total publications, significantly influencing the evolution of research in this area. Key contributions were made by institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the University of Science and Technology of China, with Qu Xiaogang as the leading author. The journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces has become the most prolific publisher in this field. Keyword analysis indicates that since 2022, research hotspots in this field have increasingly focused on areas such as photothermal therapy, chemodynamic therapy, and ferroptosis. Challenges such as obstacles to clinical translation, limitations in recyclability, and insufficient targeting ability were addressed. The potential applications of emerging interdisciplinary technologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and organoids, in advancing nanozyme development were explored. This study offers a data-driven roadmap for researchers to navigate the evolving landscape of nanozyme innovation, emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration in impactful biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Health literacy (HL) is a determinant of health and important for autonomous decision-making. Migrants are at high risk for limited HL. Improving HL is important for equitable promotion of migrants' health.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of interventions for improving HL in migrants. To assess whether female or male migrants respond differently to the identified interventions.\nSEARCH METHODS: We ran electronic searches to 2 February 2022 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo and CINAHL. We also searched trial registries. We used a study filter for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (RCT classifier).\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs and cluster-RCTs addressing HL either as a concept or its components (access, understand, appraise, apply health information).\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane and followed the PRISMA-E guidelines. Outcome categories were: a) HL, b) quality of life (QoL), c) knowledge, d) health outcomes, e) health behaviour, f) self-efficacy, g) health service use and h) adverse events. We conducted meta-analysis where possible, and reported the remaining results as a narrative synthesis.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included 28 RCTs and six cluster-RCTs (8249 participants), all conducted in high-income countries. Participants were migrants with a wide range of conditions. All interventions were adapted to culture, language and literacy. We did not find evidence that HL interventions cause harm, but only two studies assessed adverse events (e.g. anxiety). Many studies reported results for short-term assessments (less than six weeks after total programme completion), reported here. For several comparisons, there were also findings at later time points, which are presented in the review text. Compared with no HL intervention (standard care/no intervention) or an unrelated HL intervention (similar intervention but different information topic) Self-management programmes (SMP) probably improve self-efficacy slightly (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.50; 2 studies, 333 participants; moderate certainty). SMP may improve HIV-related HL (understanding (mean difference (MD) 4.25, 95% CI 1.32 to 7.18); recognition of HIV terms (MD 3.32, 95% CI 1.28 to 5.36)) (1 study, 69 participants). SMP may slightly improve health behaviours (3 studies, 514 participants), but may have little or no effect on knowledge (2 studies, 321 participants) or subjective health status (MD 0.38, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.89; 1 study, 69 participants) (low certainty). We are uncertain of the effects of SMP on QoL, health service use or adverse events due to a lack of evidence. HL skills building courses (HLSBC) may improve knowledge (MD 10.87, 95% CI 5.69 to 16.06; 2 studies, 111 participants) and any generic HL (SMD 0.48, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.75; 2 studies, 229 participants), but may have little or no effect on depression literacy (MD 0.17, 95% CI -1.28 to 1.62) or any health behaviour (2 studies, 229 participants) (low certainty). We are uncertain if HLSBC improve QoL, health outcomes, health service use, self-efficacy or adverse events, due to very low-certainty or a lack of evidence. Audio-/visual education without personal feedback (AVE) probably improves depression literacy (MD 8.62, 95% CI 7.51 to 9.73; 1 study, 202 participants) and health service use (MD -0.59, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.07; 1 study, 157 participants), but probably has little or no effect on health behaviour (risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.25; 1 study, 135 participants) (moderate certainty). AVE may improve self-efficacy (MD 3.51, 95% CI 2.53 to 4.49; 1 study, 133 participants) and may slightly improve knowledge (MD 8.44, 95% CI -2.56 to 19.44; 2 studies, 293 participants) and intention to seek depression treatment (MD 1.8, 95% CI 0.43 to 3.17), with little or no effect on depression (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.10) (low certainty). No evidence was found for QoL and adverse events. Adapted medical instruction may improve understanding of health information (3 studies, 478 participants), with little or no effect on medication adherence (MD 0.5, 95% CI -0.1 to 1.1; 1 study, 200 participants) (low certainty). No evidence was found for QoL, health outcomes, knowledge, health service use, self-efficacy or adverse events. Compared with written information on the same topic SMP probably improves health numeracy slightly (MD 0.7, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.25) and probably improves print literacy (MD 9, 95% CI 2.9 to 15.1; 1 study, 209 participants) and self-efficacy (SMD 0.47, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.64; 4 studies, 552 participants) (moderate certainty). SMP may improve any disease-specific HL (SMD 0.67, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.07; 4 studies, 955 participants), knowledge (MD 11.45, 95% CI 4.75 to 18.15; 6 studies, 1101 participants) and some health behaviours (4 studies, 797 participants), with little or no effect on health information appraisal (MD 1.15, 95% CI -0.23 to 2.53; 1 study, 329 participants) (low certainty). We are uncertain whether SMP improves QoL, health outcomes, health service use or adverse events, due to a lack of evidence or low/very low-certainty evidence. AVE probably has little or no effect on diabetes HL (MD 2, 95% CI -0.15 to 4.15; 1 study, 240 participants), but probably improves information appraisal (MD -9.88, 95% CI -12.87 to -6.89) and application (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.77) (1 study, 608 participants; moderate certainty). AVE may slightly improve knowledge (MD 8.35, 95% CI -0.32 to 17.02; low certainty). No short-term evidence was found for QoL, depression, health behaviour, self-efficacy, health service use or adverse events. AVE compared with another AVE We are uncertain whether narrative videos are superior to factual knowledge videos as the evidence is of very low certainty. Gender differences Female migrants' diabetes HL may improve slightly more than that of males, when receiving AVE (MD 5.00, 95% CI 0.62 to 9.38; 1 study, 118 participants), but we do not know whether female or male migrants benefit differently from other interventions due to very low-certainty or a lack of evidence.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Adequately powered studies measuring long-term effects (more than six months) of HL interventions in female and male migrants are needed, using well-validated tools and representing various healthcare systems.",

    "abstract": "In this community review report, we discuss applications and techniques for <i>fast</i> machine learning (ML) in science-the concept of integrating powerful ML methods into the real-time experimental data processing loop to accelerate scientific discovery. The material for the report builds on two workshops held by the Fast ML for Science community and covers three main areas: applications for fast ML across a number of scientific domains; techniques for training and implementing performant and resource-efficient ML algorithms; and computing architectures, platforms, and technologies for deploying these algorithms. We also present overlapping challenges across the multiple scientific domains where common solutions can be found. This community report is intended to give plenty of examples and inspiration for scientific discovery through integrated and accelerated ML solutions. This is followed by a high-level overview and organization of technical advances, including an abundance of pointers to source material, which can enable these breakthroughs.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are poised to make a transformative impact on chemical sciences by dramatically accelerating computational algorithms and amplifying insights available from computational chemistry methods. However, achieving this requires a confluence and coaction of expertise in computer science and physical sciences. This Review is written for new and experienced researchers working at the intersection of both fields. We first provide concise tutorials of computational chemistry and machine learning methods, showing how insights involving both can be achieved. We follow with a critical review of noteworthy applications that demonstrate how computational chemistry and machine learning can be used together to provide insightful (and useful) predictions in molecular and materials modeling, retrosyntheses, catalysis, and drug design.",
