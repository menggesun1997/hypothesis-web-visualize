    "title": "Emotion-Driven Vector Symbolic Concept Evolution in Language Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Language models do not incorporate emotional dynamics into their concept representations, restricting their ability to model affective influences in human concept formation.",
    "Motivation": "Directly addresses the external gap of underdeveloped affective processes in meta-learned models, extending vector symbolic architectures to represent affective state changes impacting concept evolution.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a dynamic vector symbolic architecture extension within language models where concept vectors are modulated by emotion embeddings. Emotions are encoded as vectors bound and unbound to semantic vectors in context-sensitive manners, enabling morphing of concepts based on affective state. The system learns emotion-concept associations from annotated text and multimodal data.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble datasets with text labeled for emotional content and conceptual context (e.g., ISEAR, sentiment-labeled stories).\n2. Train emotion embedding modules.\n3. Integrate these with vector symbolic concept representations in language models.\n4. Evaluate on tasks requiring emotional adaptation of concepts (e.g., sentiment-dependent word sense disambiguation).\n5. Benchmark against baseline language models without affective modulation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence \"The cold wind made her feel lonely.\"\nExpected Output: Concept vector for 'wind' modulated by negative affect, influencing downstream semantic predictions or text generation to reflect loneliness and coldness associations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If vector symbolic affect integration is unstable, implement emotion gates that scale concept vector activations instead. Utilize simpler emotional categories or dimensional affect models like valence/arousal for robustness."
