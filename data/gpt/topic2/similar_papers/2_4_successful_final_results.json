    "Problem_Statement": "Existing multilingual scientific LMs do not efficiently embed complex regulatory knowledge, limiting their compliance and localization capabilities for biosimilar domains across international contexts.",
    "Motivation": "This idea expands on the high-potential opportunity to integrate regulatory graph structures with ML, filling the gap of insufficient exploration of regulatory compliance integration within language model pipelines in multilingual contexts.",

        "title": "Neuro-Symbolic Embedding Fusion of Multilingual Regulatory Knowledge Graphs for Fine-Tuning Language Models in Biosimilar Compliance",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current multilingual scientific language models lack effective integration of complex regulatory knowledge, particularly for biosimilar approvals that involve heterogeneous, jurisdiction-specific, and multilingual regulatory frameworks, thereby limiting their ability to generate compliance-accurate and locally contextualized scientific communication.",
        "Motivation": "While prior efforts integrate graph embeddings with language models, challenges remain in fusing symbolic regulatory knowledge structures with neural token embeddings in multilingual settings. Our research addresses these gaps by proposing a transparent, jointly optimized neuro-symbolic embedding architecture that explicitly aligns and fuses multilingual regulatory knowledge graphs with transformer token representations. This approach pushes the frontier beyond existing graph-LM fusion methods by emphasizing regulatory compliance fidelity and interpretability in highly regulated biosimilar domains, thus delivering a novel framework with demonstrable advantages in compliance-aware multilingual scientific communication.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular neuro-symbolic embedding framework comprising: (1) construction of multilingual regulatory knowledge graphs representing approval criteria, terminologies, and jurisdictional nuances extracted from curated biosimilar regulatory documents with defined legal and ethical compliance protocols; (2) developing a novel embedding fusion architecture that integrates graph convolutional network (GCN) embeddings of regulatory graph substructures with transformer token embeddings via a specifically designed cross-modal attention mechanism. This mechanism aligns graph-encoded regulatory nodes with corresponding token spans in multilingual inputs, enabling joint contextualization. The fusion layer employs a learnable gating function to weigh regulatory constraints adaptively during LM fine-tuning. The entire architecture is end-to-end differentiable, optimizing a composite loss function balancing language modeling objectives with regulatory compliance constraints implicitly encoded in graph embeddings. Pseudocode and architecture diagrams will detail data flows and training routines. This design explicitly enforces regulatory knowledge encoding while preserving language model expressivity, ensuring superior compliance fidelity and cross-lingual generalizability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Acquisition & Curation: Select a manageable initial subset of biosimilar regulatory documents from 2-3 jurisdictions with multilingual content; establish legal and ethical data usage protocols; extract and normalize regulatory facts to build high-quality multilingual knowledge graphs with expert validation.\n2) Graph Embedding Validation: Develop GCN embeddings for regulatory graphs; benchmark embeddings on tasks such as node classification and relation prediction to ensure structural and semantic integrity.\n3) Integration Module Testing: Build and validate the cross-modal attention fusion layer separately by measuring alignment quality between graph embeddings and token embeddings on curated multilingual snippets.\n4) Joint Fine-Tuning: Integrate the fusion module with a transformer-based multilingual LM; implement composite loss with regulatory compliance regularization terms; train on biosimilar scientific corpora with incremental inclusion of graph embeddings.\n5) Evaluation & Ablation: Evaluate on multilingual regulatory compliance tasks, including summarization preserving nuanced directives and constrained translation fidelity; compare against baselines without graph embeddings and with rule-based annotations.\n6) Controlled Ablation & Scalability Studies: Conduct experiments systematically disabling fusion components to assess their impact and gradually scale to more languages and regulatory subsets.\n7) Ethical and Practical Considerations: Throughout, document data governance, reproducibility protocols, and resource utilization metrics to ensure project feasibility and compliance with confidentiality constraints.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Given a German regulatory document snippet and its corresponding subgraph encoding approval criteria, terminology, and jurisdiction-specific constraints, the model outputs an English summary that accurately reflects all regulatory nuances. Compliance fidelity is quantitatively validated by overlaying predicted outputs against graph-enforced constraints, with qualitative expert review to ensure no regulatory information loss or distortion across languages.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the integrated neuro-symbolic embedding fusion does not yield expected compliance improvements or proves computationally infeasible, fallback experiments will focus on leveraging rich rule-based annotations as explicit constraints in LM fine-tuning and employing knowledge distillation to transfer regulatory graph insights encoded in GCNs down to transformer parameter subspaces. Additionally, we plan to augment training sets with synthetically generated regulatory examples to enhance model robustness incrementally while maintaining incremental scaling in multilingual and regulatory complexity."

          "feedback_content": "While the idea to integrate multilingual regulatory knowledge graphs into LM fine-tuning is promising, the Proposed_Method lacks sufficient clarity on how the novel embedding techniques will effectively fuse graph convolution embeddings with transformer token embeddings. More detailed explanation is needed on architectural design, the alignment between graph-based and token-based representations, and how the system will jointly optimize these components to ensure regulatory constraints are faithfully encoded and utilized by the LM during fine-tuning. Without this, the mechanism risks being under-specified and may impair reproducibility and evaluation rigor. Consider providing diagrams or pseudocode to clarify these interactions and optimization strategies within the model pipeline, highlighting how the embeddings explicitly enforce or enhance regulatory knowledge integration in multilingual contexts, which is crucial for soundness of the approach and its eventual success in compliance-heavy domains like biosimilars locally and internationally. This enhancement will strengthen reviewer confidence in the technical novelty and soundness of the core contribution beyond established graph-embedding and LM fusion techniques in related literature. Targeting this gap first will also inform feasibility and evaluation strategies consistently downstream in the pipeline setup and metrics design phases of the project, reducing the risk of conceptual obstacles escalating to experimental failures or misinterpretations later on. Addressing this will improve the theoretical and practical rigor substantially, clarifying how the method distinguishes itself in a competitive area with overlapping approaches already published or in progress globally.

          "feedback_content": "The Experiment_Plan outlines a logical progression from graph construction through LM fine-tuning and evaluation. However, it currently underestimates the substantial resource demands and practical challenges involved in building comprehensive, multilingual regulatory knowledge graphs specifically for biosimilar approval documents, which are often confidential, heterogeneous, and vary considerably across jurisdictions. The plan should explicitly include data acquisition strategies, legal and ethical considerations, and curation protocols to ensure high-quality, consistent graph structures. Furthermore, the integration and joint training of graph convolutional embeddings with transformer models present non-trivial computational and convergence challenges. The plan should anticipate and specify modular validation steps for each major component (e.g., separate benchmarking of graph embedding quality, compatibility checks with token embeddings before LM fine-tuning), fallback experiments with rule-based annotations should be more explicitly leveraged as controlled ablation studies rather than mere backup. Finally, to realistically manage project scope and validate methodology incrementally, consider starting with fewer languages or a limited regulatory subset before scaling. Expanding the experiment plan to fully acknowledge these challenges and incorporate mitigation strategies will enhance feasibility and increase the likelihood of meaningful, generalizable outcomes.
