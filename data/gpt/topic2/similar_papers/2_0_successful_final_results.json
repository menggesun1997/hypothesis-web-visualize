    "Problem_Statement": "Existing language models struggle to integrate multilingual scientific communication effectively while respecting complex biomedical regulatory requirements, especially given the small, noisy, and heterogeneous data scenario.",
    "Motivation": "This idea targets the critical internal gap of adapting sophisticated CNN techniques (residual blocks, continuous wavelet transform) into small-data-centric language model fine-tuning for interpretable, regulatory-aware multilingual language processing, as identified under the hidden bridge analysis between CNNs and approval processes.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid language model architecture where convolutional modules with residual blocks and continuous wavelet transform layers preprocess multilingual biomedical text embeddings to extract robust, regulatory-relevant features. This output feeds into a transformer-based language model fine-tuned on limited, multilingual biosimilar datasets with regularization reflecting regulatory compliance constraints (e.g., interpretability and auditability losses). The framework includes constraints mimicking regulatory validation checkpoints as training feedback.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multilingual biosimilar scientific corpora with regulatory annotations and limited size; 2) Implement CNN modules with residual blocks and continuous wavelet transform preprocessing; 3) Integrate with transformer-based LM fine-tuning; 4) Baselines: vanilla transformer LM fine-tuning, CNN-alone, and non-CWT language models; 5) Metrics: BLEU for communication fidelity, interpretability scores (feature relevance), regulatory compliance proxies, and robustness on noisy inputs; 6) Cross-validate across languages and biosimilar contexts.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Scientific abstract in Spanish describing a biosimilar clinical trial with regulatory terms. Expected output: Accurate, compliant English summary highlighting key regulatory elements with explainable model attention aligning to regulatory keywords.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If the CNN modules fail to enhance performance, fallback to ablation removing continuous wavelet transform layers, or replace CNN modules with graph convolutional networks representing regulatory knowledge graphs. Employ data augmentation via GANs to compensate for small data."

        "title": "CNN-Infused Regulatory-Compliant Multilingual LM with Gated Fusion for Enhanced Interpretability",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing language models face challenges in effectively integrating multilingual scientific communication within complex biomedical regulatory frameworks, particularly under conditions of limited, noisy, and heterogeneous data. Current methods struggle to transparently incorporate regulatory knowledge while maintaining robust cross-lingual performance and interpretability required for compliance.",
        "Motivation": "While prior approaches combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with transformer-based language models (LMs), they lack explicit, theoretically justified mechanisms for fusing CNN-extracted wavelet-transformed features with transformer embeddings to improve regulatory interpretability and auditability. Addressing this gap, our work introduces a novel gated fusion architecture that integrates continuous wavelet transform (CWT) enhanced CNN modules with transformer embeddings to create a hybrid LM optimized for multilingual biosimilar regulatory text. This method advances beyond NOV-COMPETITIVE baselines by providing clear architectural transparency, explicit multimodal alignment, and regulatory-aware loss constraints. Additionally, integrating gated recurrent units (GRUs) to modulate feature fusion draws inspiration from adaptive learning systems, enhancing model interpretability and cognitive-load-aware decision pathways under data scarcity.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-stage hybrid LM architecture optimized for small, multilingual biomedical regulatory corpora: (1) Input texts are first processed through multilingual embeddings, then passed to convolutional modules featuring residual blocks combined with continuous wavelet transform (CWT) layers, which extract robust time-frequency features highlighting regulatory text patterns. (2) Parallelly, token-level embeddings feed into a transformer-based LM pretrained on biomedical texts. (3) To fuse these heterogeneous representations, we incorporate a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based fusion module that temporally aligns and semantically integrates the CNN-CWT features with transformer embeddings, dynamically weighting the contribution of each modality per token. This fusion promotes transparency by enabling interpretable gating attention scores correlated with regulatory keywords. (4) The combined embeddings are passed through a regulatory compliance-aware fine-tuning stage, incorporating interpretability-driven losses (e.g., attention alignment with regulatory annotations) and auditability constraints simulating validation checkpoints. We provide schematic modular diagrams detailing the data flow and fusion mechanism to ensure reproducibility. (5) A benchmarking protocol evaluates BLEU scores, interpretability via gradient-based feature attribution aligned with domain expert annotations, and custom regulatory compliance proxies quantifying coverage of regulatory concepts. Our method fuses insights from medical image analysis registration techniques to temporally and semantically align multimodal features, ensuring robust, explainable multilingual understanding under limited data.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Acquisition: Collaborate with biomedical regulatory bodies and multilingual scientific repositories to collect and license a curated dataset of biosimilar clinical trial abstracts with explicit regulatory annotations in Spanish, English, and one additional language (e.g., French). Expected dataset size is approximately 5K documents, balancing privacy and licensing constraints. 2) Data Preprocessing: Normalize and tokenize texts, generate fine-grained regulatory keyword annotations at the sentence and token levels, verifying annotation quality via expert review. 3) Model Implementation: Develop CNN modules with residual blocks and CWT preprocessing layers; implement the transformer LM; design and integrate the GRU-based fusion module with attention gating mechanisms. 4) Pilot Studies: Conduct ablation experiments focusing on the fusion module’s alignment and gating interpretability with a held-out validation set. 5) Training and Fine-tuning: Train the hybrid model with multitask losses—translation fidelity, interpretability alignment to regulatory annotations, and auditability losses simulating regulatory validation checkpoints. 6) Evaluation Metrics: Quantitatively assess BLEU for multilingual communication fidelity; use interpretable attribution methods (integrated gradients and attention weight analysis) benchmarked against expert annotations to score interpretability; define regulatory compliance proxies measuring coverage and explicitness of compliance terms; test robustness under noisy inputs. 7) Cross-validation: Perform stratified cross-validation across languages and biosimilar contexts to confirm generalizability. 8) Contingency Planning: Define explicit thresholds (performance drops >10% in interpretability or BLEU) to trigger fallback intervention employing graph convolutional networks (GCNs) encoding domain-specific regulatory knowledge graphs, and GAN-based data augmentation to address annotation scarcity, ensuring evaluation consistency through held-out benchmarking protocols.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A Spanish scientific abstract describing a biosimilar clinical trial featuring complex regulatory terminology, including compliance criteria and pharmacovigilance terms. Expected output: An accurate English summary that clearly highlights and explains key regulatory elements, with model attention weights and gating scores interpretable by domain experts, aligning closely with annotated regulatory keywords. A side output includes heatmaps of wavelet-transformed CNN features mapped to critical regulatory time-frequency patterns, demonstrating multimodal interpretability.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If experiments reveal that the CNN-CWT modules or GRU-fusion fail to provide significant interpretability or performance gains (e.g., less than 5% BLEU improvement or poor regulatory attention alignment), we will ablate the continuous wavelet transform layers and compare with pure residual CNN features. If performance remains inadequate, we will replace the CNN modules with graph convolutional networks (GCNs) designed to embed biomedical regulatory knowledge graphs, explicitly modeling inter-concept dependencies. Additionally, GAN-based data augmentation tailored for multilingual biomedical text will be employed to expand training data, carefully monitored to ensure synthetic data realism and maintain evaluation metric consistency. These fallback interventions will be activated based on pre-defined metric thresholds and pilot results, ensuring robustness and practical feasibility of the overall approach."

Specifically, the proposal should elaborate on how the wavelet-transformed convolutional features are aligned temporally and semantically with the transformer inputs, how these are fused or concatenated, and how this architectural hybridization concretely improves interpretability and regulatory compliance. Clarifying this pipeline and its theoretical justification will strengthen the soundness of the approach and facilitate reproducibility for reviewers and future researchers regardless of domain-specific expertise in wavelets or regulatory modeling. Consider including schematic diagrams or modular data flow descriptions and preliminary results or pilot experiments to concretely demonstrate these mechanisms in the next revision of Proposed_Method sections."

The plan should address realistic sourcing strategies, potential licensing or privacy challenges, and the expected scale of these data. Additionally, the integration of interpretability and regulatory compliance metrics is ambitious but lacks specification on how these metrics will be quantitatively measured, benchmarked, or validated, given the small and noisy dataset context. The fallback plan involves graph convolutional networks and GAN-based augmentation but needs clearer criteria for triggering these strategies and how this will affect evaluation consistency. Including contingency plans for data scarcity, annotation quality, and metric reliability will improve the experiment plan's practicality and robustness."
