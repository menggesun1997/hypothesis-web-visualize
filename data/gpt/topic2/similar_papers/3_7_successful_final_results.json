        "title": "Cognitively-Grounded Contrastive Meta-Learning of Multimodal Emotion-Infused Compositionality in Language Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "While existing meta-learning frameworks capture aspects of compositional language cognition, they insufficiently model how emotional affect—including multimodal signals such as prosodic audio and facial expressions—modulates compositional understanding, an essential dimension for human-like language comprehension and generation grounded in cognitive science.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the NOV-COMPETITIVE landscape, our work advances affect-aware language meta-learning by integrating principles from implicit cognition and learning science to ground affective modulation explicitly within a cognitive-neuroscientific framework of compositionality. Leveraging contrastive learning, multimodal affective embeddings (prosody, facial animation), and meta-learning, this approach transcends prior methods that treat emotion and compositional cognition as separate or implicit, aiming to develop a richer, mechanistically interpretable foundation model that aligns with natural language understanding and intelligent computing techniques. This integration not only improves compositional generalization but also paves future research directions in generative AI and the science of learning.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel meta-learning architecture where language representations are decomposed compositionally into primitive units, each conditioned explicitly on continuous, cognitively-inspired affective embeddings derived from multimodal inputs: discrete emotion labels, prosodic audio features, and facial animation parameters. The affective embeddings are parameterized via a trainable encoder grounded in implicit cognition theories, capturing nuanced emotional states beyond discrete categories. Within episodic meta-learning, the model learns to compose representations through attention-based modules that modulate compositional primitives by affective context, effectively implementing affective gating mechanisms aligned with neuroscientific findings on emotion-cognition interaction. The contrastive loss is formulated to discriminate between composition candidates that are congruent versus incongruent in both semantic and affective dimensions: \n\nL_{contrastive} = - \\mathbb{E}_{(x, x^+)} \\log \\frac{exp(sim(f(x), f(x^+))/\\tau)}{\\sum_{x^-} exp(sim(f(x), f(x^-))/\\tau)}\n\nwhere f(x) denotes the learned multimodal emotion-compositional embedding, sim is cosine similarity, and negatives x^- include compositional pairs mismatched either semantically or affectively. This loss drives the model to embed compositional expressions conditioned on nuanced affective states distinctly, enhancing generalization when exposed to new combinations in meta-learning episodes. This explicit mechanistic conditioning and contrastive training jointly enable the model to internalize how affect modulates compositional semantics, advancing beyond implicit or separate affective treatments in prior art. The multimodal input fusion and cognitive grounding significantly differentiate our method, enhancing soundness, reproducibility, and impact.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect and curate multimodal datasets containing language with compositional phrases annotated for discrete affect (e.g., sarcasm, irony) augmented with synchronized audio prosody and facial animation signals.\n2) Pretrain affective encoders for prosody and facial cues based on implicit cognition grounded objectives.\n3) Implement baseline meta-learning compositional models without affect conditioning to establish reference metrics.\n4) Integrate cognitive-inspired multimodal affective embeddings into compositional primitives with attention-based affective gating modules.\n5) Define and apply the multimodal affective-semantic contrastive loss in meta-learning episodes to train the full model.\n6) Evaluate compositional generalization on standard benchmarks and affective alignment using both discrete and continuous measures.\n7) Analyze internal mechanisms and interpret neuroscientific alignment through probing and representational similarity analyses.\n8) Compare results to unimodal and discrete-only affect conditions to demonstrate the benefit of multimodal cognitive grounding.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input Example 1: Pairs of phrases like (\"Great job\" with sincere prosody/facial expression vs. \"Great job\" with sarcastic prosody/facial cues).\nExpected Output 1: The learned embeddings reveal distinct clusters reflecting affect-driven compositional interpretations, with the model correctly disambiguating sarcastic vs. sincere compositional meanings.\n\nInput Example 2: Novel compositional phrases combining emotional affect not seen during training, expressed through multimodal signals.\nExpected Output 2: The model generalizes compositional semantics affected by emotion accurately, showing improved performance over baselines without affective conditioning or using only discrete emotion labels.\n\nAdditional tests include ablations removing certain modalities or cognitive grounding to validate their impact.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal affective embeddings pose integration challenges, we will fallback to refining continuous audio prosody features only, leveraging transfer learning from speech emotion recognition, combined with continuous affective embeddings grounded in implicit cognition. Alternatively, we will incorporate symbolic cognitive constraints within the meta-learning framework to approximate affective modulation. Ablation studies will identify the minimal effective combination of signals, ensuring progress toward emotion-aware compositional meta-learning even under limited modalities."

Providing a more detailed exposition of the model architecture, the parameterization of affective embeddings, and the precise formulation of the contrastive loss would strengthen the conceptual soundness and reproducibility of the approach. Explain how emotion influences the representation learning step by step, and how these mechanisms concretely lead to enhanced compositional generalization under meta-learning assumptions, to justify feasibility and validity of the core idea effectively. This will also help differentiate the contribution in a competitive landscape where similar components already exist intrinsically or explicitly intertwined in prior work, addressing core assumptions with rigor and clarity in implementation details to improve soundness and novelty impact simultaneously.

Additionally, considering multimodal inputs such as facial animation or prosodic audio features as alternative or complementary affective signals aligns well with the fallback plan and globally-linked concepts, potentially leading to a richer, more holistic model. This integration could serve as a foundation for future research directions in intelligent computing and generative AI, substantially broadening both theoretical significance and practical impact in compositional language modeling affected by emotion.
