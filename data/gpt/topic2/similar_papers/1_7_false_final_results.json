    "title": "Unified Benchmark Suite for Evaluating Cross-Domain Scientific Language Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of standardized benchmarks that evaluate scientific LLMs across interlinked domains such as materials science, clinical research, and complex question answering hampers holistic model assessment and development.",
    "Motivation": "Fills a meta-level gap by creating evaluation tools that reflect the multi-domain integration challenges highlighted in the research landscape analysis, enabling progress tracking on key integration objectives.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a benchmark suite combining datasets from complex QA, material property prediction, clinical trial design questions, and cross-domain reasoning tasks. Include metrics for factual accuracy, generalization beyond fine-tuned domains, hallucination sensitivity, and interpretability. Provide challenge tasks involving multi-step reasoning grounded in domain knowledge graphs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate and harmonize datasets representative of each domain and their intersections. 2) Define evaluation metrics tailored to scientific discovery tasks. 3) Validate benchmark on existing scientific LLMs and multi-agent systems. 4) Release benchmark publicly with baseline leaderboards.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Task: Answer complex multi-faceted questions that require knowledge spanning materials design and clinical applications, e.g., 'Identify drug delivery materials suitable for targeted cancer immunotherapy.' Output: Factual, multi-domain integrated answers with supporting evidence.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If data scarcity limits benchmark scope, design synthetic data generators simulating cross-domain reasoning. Use active learning to iteratively enhance benchmark difficulty."
