    "title": "Embodied Interactive Concept Learning via Human-in-the-Loop Vision-Language Feedback",
    "Problem_Statement": "Static datasets and models fail to capture evolving embodied human concept formation that depends on interactive perception and feedback.",
    "Motivation": "This project explores active human feedback loops integrating vision-language models with embodied cognition insights to close the external gap of missing embodied interaction in concept modeling.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement an interactive vision-language system that learns concept representations through iterative human feedback during object manipulation tasks. The model combines vision-language embedding with reinforcement learning modulated by human corrective input encoding embodied context. Vector symbolic architectures enable compositional updates to concept vectors based on interaction outcomes and feedback.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop an interactive platform with real-time human feedback on object identification and concept labeling.\n2. Collect embodied interaction episodes with feedback.\n3. Train the system with reinforcement learning and vector symbolic updates.\n4. Measure improvements in concept accuracy, compositionality, and adaptive learning rates.\n5. Compare with static learning baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "User manipulates object and says \"No, that’s not a cup, it’s a bowl.\"\nExpected Output: Model adjusts the concept vector representation for the observed object embedding with human feedback signal, improving future classification.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If live feedback integration is challenging, simulate feedback using labeled datasets or scripted correction utterances. Alternatively, implement offline retrospective feedback learning."
