        "title": "Wavelet-Enhanced, Data-Centric Explainable AI for Regulatory Multilingual Biomedical Language Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "Multilingual language models employed in regulatory biomedical domains often act as opaque systems, limiting interpretability and auditability essential for compliance. Additionally, biomedical multilingual datasets are frequently scarce, which hampers both model performance and meaningful explanation generation for regulatory purposes.",
        "Motivation": "To address the opaque nature of language models in critical regulatory biomedical settings and the challenge of low-resource multilingual data, we introduce a novel approach leveraging continuous wavelet transforms (CWT) integrated within transformer architectures for multi-scale linguistic feature extraction. This is synergistically combined with user-centered Explainable AI (XAI) mechanisms and data-centric AI practices to curate and augment relevant datasets. This integrated methodology promises improved interpretability aligned with domain regulatory lexicons and enhanced generalizability, ultimately enabling transparent, auditable, and trustworthy machine learning systems in multilingual biomedical regulatory contexts. Aligning wavelet-based interpretability with established XAI frameworks and structured data enhancement distinguishes this approach markedly from prior art, addressing current limitations in novelty and practical utility.",
        "Proposed_Method": "1) **Mathematical and Architectural Integration of CWT within Transformers:** We propose to treat input token embeddings as discrete-time signals and employ a learnable continuous wavelet transform kernel bank applied along the embedding dimensions to extract multi-scale temporal-frequency features. Specifically, for a sequence of token embeddings \\( X = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n] \\), each embedding vector \\( x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d \\) is processed independently over the sequence position axis using CWT with a set of wavelets \\( \u0000\\psi_s \\) parameterized by scale \\( s \\), obtaining wavelet coefficients \\( W_s = \\int x(t) \u0000\\psi_s^*(t - \u0000\tau) dt \\). Practically, this is implemented as a differentiable convolutional operation enabling gradient backpropagation. 2) **Fusion Mechanism:** Wavelet coefficients are projected via learnable linear layers and fused with standard self-attention score matrices through a weighted additive attention enhancement module. This fusion modulates positional and contextual attention distributions to capture hierarchical linguistic patterns at varying resolutions. 3) **Interpretability Alignment:** Extracted wavelet attention maps are aligned to biomedical regulatory lexicons and multilingual domain keywords using similarity metrics, transforming raw wavelet features into interpretable signals highlighting compliance-relevant terms. 4) **User-Centered Post-Hoc Explainability:** We develop an interactive dashboard combining wavelet-enhanced attention visualizations with linked domain-specific electronic health record datasets and regulatory lexicon overlays for expert-in-the-loop auditability and explanation refinement. This interface supports traceability of model decisions to regulatory criteria. 5) **Data-Centric AI Augmentation:** To counter limited data scenarios, we curate a multilingual biomedical regulatory corpus augmented by data synthesis techniques guided by regulatory lexicons, ensuring model exposure to salient domain concepts and improving the reliability of interpretability signals. Overall, these contributions provide a reproducible scheme and code blueprint, with schematics detailing architectural modules, training pipelines, complexity analysis, and stability considerations tailored to biomedical regulatory language complexity.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Formalize and implement the differentiable CWT module as a plug-in to transformer encoder layers, validating gradient propagation and computational efficiency. 2) Construct or augment multilingual biomedical regulatory datasets employing data-centric methods incorporating regulatory lexicons and domain knowledge. 3) Train wavelet-enhanced transformers on these datasets and baseline transformers without wavelet modules under identical conditions, carefully monitoring training stability and convergence. 4) Evaluate interpretability through quantitative metrics including alignment scores between wavelet attention and regulatory keywords, BLEU scores for translation fidelity, and novel interpretability indices designed for auditability. 5) Conduct qualitative expert assessment using the interactive post-hoc explanation dashboard, soliciting regulatory domain experts to verify compliance-relevant explanation clarity. 6) Benchmark regulatory audit pass rates comparing model outputs with standard compliance checklists. 7) Analyze model complexity and training stability impacts introduced by CWT modules, and adjust hyperparameters accordingly.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multilingual paragraphs describing drug safety protocols from diverse regulatory documents, such as FDA and EMA guidelines in English, German, and Chinese. Output: (a) Multi-scale wavelet attention visualizations that highlight regulatory key compliance phrases and their hierarchical linguistic contexts across languages; (b) Model-generated transparent summaries citing relevant regulatory criteria with traceable attention evidence; (c) Interactive dashboard views allowing domain experts to explore attention distributions over electronic health record annotations and regulatory lexicons interactively, facilitating compliance auditing and interpretation refinement.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If integration of fully continuous wavelet transforms proves computationally prohibitive or detrimentally impacts training stability, we will explore discrete wavelet transform (DWT) alternatives offering computationally efficient multi-resolution analysis compatible with discrete token inputs. Further, should architectural fusion impede interpretability, we will augment post-hoc explanation techniques by coupling standard transformer outputs with regulatory lexicon-based overlays, leveraging well-established XAI methods like attention rollout and feature perturbation analyses. In parallel, intensified data-centric augmentation will mitigate low-resource effects to preserve interpretability fidelity."

As transformers operate on discrete tokens and CWT is typically applied on continuous signals, the mechanism for bridging these modalities, handling discrete multilingual text input, and backpropagation through wavelet features is not well articulated. Clarify the mathematical formulation and architectural modifications enabling this integration, including how wavelet features are extracted, fused, and interpreted within the attention process, to establish a sound and reproducible method design framework that reviewers and practitioners can trust and build upon. Without this clarity, the novelty and effectiveness claims remain speculative and undermine both soundness and feasibility assessments. Please provide algorithmic or architectural schematics and explain implications for model complexity and training stability explicitly in Proposed_Method section to solidify soundness of approach and help reviewers gauge feasibility with respect to multilingual biomedical regulatory texts complexity and limited data settings."

Specifically, consider complementing the wavelet-based interpretability signals with user-centered post-hoc explanation mechanisms, such as interactive visualization dashboards combining wavelet attention patterns with domain-specific electronic health records (EHR) features or regulatory lexicons. Incorporate data-centric AI practices to curate or augment multilingual biomedical datasets tailored to regulatory scenarios, strengthening model generalizability and interpretability relevance under low-resource conditions.
