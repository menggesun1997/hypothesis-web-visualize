    "title": "Affective Meta-Learning for Embodied Semantic Control in Concept Formation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing meta-learning frameworks for semantics lack incorporation of affective states and embodiment cues, reducing flexibility and context sensitivity in modeling human concept formation mechanisms.",
    "Motivation": "This idea directly addresses the external gap involving underdeveloped affective and embodied cognitive processes in meta-learned semantic control models, capitalizing on the bridge between human-object interaction datasets and affective neuroscience insights.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a meta-learning model embedding affective state representations derived from physiological and interaction signals into a learned control module that modulates semantic concept formation dynamically. The model ingests multimodal data including video of human-object interactions annotated with emotional context cues. A recurrent control network uses these affective embeddings to adaptively gate the semantic concept learner, enabling context- and affect-sensitive concept abstractions.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect and annotate datasets combining human-object interactions with affective labels (e.g., CAD-120 extended with emotion tagging).\n2. Encode affective signals via auxiliary CNN/LSTM modules.\n3. Develop a meta-learning architecture with a gating/control module modulated by affective embeddings.\n4. Train the system on tasks requiring flexible semantic adaptation (e.g., predicting object affordances under varying emotional contexts).\n5. Benchmark against traditional meta-learned semantic concept models on flexibility, adaptability, and alignment with human concept formation patterns.\n6. Use metrics like task accuracy, response to emotional context shifts, and generalization across affective states.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Video clip of a person happily using a mug.\nExpected Output: Adjusted concept representation for 'mug' incorporating positive affective state, predicting increased likelihood of use-related affordances.\nQuery: \"What action is likely?\" Output: \"drinking\" (modulated by affect).\nIf sadness is detected, output: \"less active use\" or \"holding\".",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If affective modulation is ineffective, simplify by using static affective labels at input or experiment with more interpretable affect embeddings (e.g., discrete valence/arousal) for easier gating. Conduct ablations removing affective inputs to isolate impact."
