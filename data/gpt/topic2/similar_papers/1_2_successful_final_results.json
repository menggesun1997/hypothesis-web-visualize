        "title": "Multimodal LLM-Augmented Clinical Trial Design with Integrative Knowledge Graph and Imaging for Oncology Trials",
        "Problem_Statement": "Designing clinical trials for complex diseases like cancer remains an arduous task due to fragmented clinical data sources, suboptimal patient stratification, and inflexible trial protocols. Current AI-augmented approaches largely focus on isolated textual or graph-structured data, lacking unified multimodal integration which limits the precision and adaptability of trial design and monitoring in oncology settings.",
        "Motivation": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating of existing language and knowledge graph-based trial design methods, this project innovates by embedding multimodal machine learning that integrates clinical text, structured knowledge graphs, and key biomedical imaging data relevant to oncology trials (e.g., melanoma, head and neck tumors). This holistic data fusion approach aims to bridge critical gaps in AI-based trial design workflows by unlocking richer biomarker characterization, enhanced patient stratification, and dynamic protocol adaptation capabilities. Focusing on oncology serves both as a high-need use case and a domain where multimodal data sources have significant clinical utility in trial optimization. Our work elevates clinical AI by delivering a comprehensive framework that surpasses prior art on integration depth, clinical relevance, and translational readiness.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an end-to-end AI framework combining (1) clinical Large Language Models fine-tuned on trial protocols and EHR text, (2) an ontology-enriched clinical trial and disease knowledge graph capturing protocols, biomarkers, outcomes, and patient attributes, and (3) deep learning models extracting imaging features from radiology and pathology scans relevant to oncology trials. These modalities will be integrated via a multimodal fusion architecture designed to enable joint reasoning and querying across language, graph, and imaging data in trial design tasks. The system will generate optimized trial protocols and patient stratification plans and support dynamic trial monitoring and adaptive protocol adjustments through continuous multimodal data streams. Explainability modules will link outputs back to graph nodes, textual evidence, and imaging biomarkers to maintain clinician trust and interpretability. We will ground our approach in head and neck and melanoma oncology to develop focused ontologies and imaging pipelines, advancing beyond existing language-graph integration approaches by incorporating previously untapped data dimensions and adaptive trial optimization workflows.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Acquisition and Preparation (Months 1-6): Collect large-scale oncology clinical trial protocols, de-identified EHR data, and curated imaging datasets (radiology/pathology) for melanoma and head and neck cancers. Develop comprehensive ontology-enriched clinical trial knowledge graphs incorporating multimodal biomarker representations.\n2) Multimodal Fusion Architecture Development (Months 7-12): Design and implement fusion models combining clinical LLM embedding outputs, knowledge graph representations, and imaging feature embeddings. Develop joint fine-tuning pipelines leveraging contrastive and multimodal alignment objectives to enable coherent reasoning.\n3) System Integration and Explainability Module Implementation (Months 13-15): Integrate components into a unified framework capable of generating trial design recommendations and dynamic monitoring suggestions, incorporating explainability by mapping reasoning paths across modalities.\n4) Evaluation on Retrospective Redesign and Simulation Tasks (Months 16-20): Validate on diverse retrospective oncology trial datasets, assessing (a) trial success proxy via established clinical endpoints, (b) patient outcome prediction accuracy comparing model stratification vs. historical cohorts, (c) iterative clinician-in-the-loop evaluation sessions with standardized protocols measuring trust, usability, and protocol acceptance. Quantify bias and uncertainty employing advanced metrics and incorporate uncertainty quantification modules.\n5) Refinement via Iterative Active Learning and Feedback (Months 21-24): Incorporate clinician feedback into model retraining cycles, employ active learning to handle noisy or incomplete inputs, and augment data with synthetic samples from domain simulations.\nResources required include GPU clusters for multimodal model training, access to oncology clinical data repositories, and clinical expert collaboration for iterative evaluation.\nConcrete intermediate milestones with timelines and metrics will be published to enable transparent progress tracking and reproducibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Design a Phase II trial for a novel immunotherapy targeting melanoma with biomarker-driven eligibility; integrate radiology and pathology imaging features to refine patient cohorts.'\nOutput: An optimized, multimodal-informed trial protocol specifying trial phase, cohort stratification criteria combining molecular and imaging biomarkers, endpoints, adaptive monitoring schedules, and risk-adjusted adjustments over trial progression. Deliver explanations referencing knowledge graph nodes, textual sources, and salient imaging features linked to clinical outcomes to facilitate clinician validation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal integration or dynamic adaptation underperforms or leads to information overload, deploy an expanded human-in-the-loop curation pipeline supplemented by uncertainty quantification to identify unreliable decisions. Incorporate advanced data augmentation using generative models for scarce imaging or protocol data and leverage active learning to prioritize data instances for expert annotation. Should full multimodal fusion be impractical initially, progressively develop specialized pipelines (NER/relation extraction from text, graph curation, imaging feature extraction) to improve modality-specific quality before tightly coupling. This staged fallback ensures continuous progress while preserving clinical relevance and system robustness."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan outlines key stages, but it lacks detail on how the integration of language and graph inputs will be operationalized and empirically validated. Specifically, fine-tuning LLMs on joint language-graph data and generating trial recommendations involves significant technical complexity, which the plan does not explicitly address. Furthermore, metrics such as 'trial success proxy scores' and 'clinician assessment' need clearer definitions and standardized evaluation protocols to ensure reproducibility and scientific rigor. Enhancing the experiment plan with concrete methods for multi-modal data fusion, validation on diverse retrospective datasets, handling potential biases in EHR and ontologies, and designing clinician-involved iterative feedback loops will improve feasibility and trustworthiness of the results. Adding timelines and resource estimates would also strengthen the practical assessment of this ambitious plan in real-world clinical AI deployment contexts. Finally, the fallback plan should be expanded beyond human curation to include data augmentation, active learning, and uncertainty quantification techniques for robust system performance under noisy and incomplete inputs as commonly encountered in clinical NLP and knowledge graph reasoning tasks. This will ensure the research progress remains grounded in technically sound and clinically relevant experimentation protocols, ultimately supporting translation to impactful clinical trial design improvements at scale and with clinician trust, thereby improving feasibility markedly in such a competitive research space.  Expand and clarify experimental methodologies and evaluation procedures for the core integration component to solidify feasibility and scientific soundness rigorously and transparently. Provide concrete, measurable intermediate milestones to de-risk the project execution phase and gain progress visibility throughout the research lifecycle, enhancing the practical viability of the promising proposed approach in this highly complex clinical domain realm. This refinement is critical for the project to convincingly demonstrate methodological novelty and clinical effectiveness beyond existing strong baselines, a necessity given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty diagnosis indicated upfront in the screening phase. These suggestions, if incorporated, will strongly improve confidence in the experiment plan as a cornerstone for reliable and high-impact outcomes from the proposed integrative LLM and knowledge graph methodology in clinical trial design enhancement applications. Thus, this feedback targets the Experiment_Plan section explicitly, aiming to elevate feasibility convincingly and concretely for this complex multiply integrated clinical AI framework research endeavor with real-world clinical impact aspirations in mind, to ultimately ensure actionable and measurable scientific contributions upon successful execution. This critique is essential to address as a priority for the proposal's overall viability and impact potential in a competitive, resource-intensive research space involving sensitive clinical data and complex multi-modal AI methodologies. "

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating and the globally-linked concepts, the proposal could significantly enhance its impact and novelty by explicitly incorporating multimodal machine learning approaches that unite not only textual and graph-structured data but also clinical imaging or other omics data modalities relevant to trials in oncology, such as head and neck tumors or melanoma. For example, integrating radiology or pathology image features with the clinical trial knowledge graph and LLM reasoning could enable richer biomarker characterization and patient stratification. This multidimensional fusion would address complex trial design questions beyond current language-graph integration frameworks alone, potentially differentiating the approach technically and clinically. Additionally, embedding AI-based tools for dynamic trial monitoring or adaptive protocol adjustments informed by multimodal data streams could extend the scope and impact substantially. Considering the mentioned tumor types can focus the clinical validation and ontology construction effort on high-need indications, providing tangible and well-defined use cases with wide applicability. Leveraging these concepts to build an end-to-end integrative platform that not only generates initial trial designs but also supports ongoing trial optimization and patient recruitment using multimodal clinical AI would represent a meaningful advancement beyond current state-of-the-art. Thus, this suggestion aims to help the innovator elevate both novelty and impact by applying the globally-linked concepts holistically, broadening the scientific scope while maintaining clinical relevance and addressing competitive differentiation in a crowded area. Integrating multimodal machine learning techniques and oncological domain specificity into the LLM+knowledge graph framework can unlock new research and translational opportunities for AI-augmented clinical trial design workflows. This feedback targets enhancing the overall idea conceptualization and justification, encouraging global technology and problem context integration to maximize research novelty and societal impact prospects."
