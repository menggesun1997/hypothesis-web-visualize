    "title": "Synthetic Regulatory-Compliant Multilingual Text Generation via GCN-GAN",
    "Problem_Statement": "Scarcity of standardized, large multilingual datasets capturing complex regulatory approval language constrains robust ML model training for scientific communication in biosimilar contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap revealing potential in combining graph convolutional networks and GANs informed by regulatory knowledge to synthesize realistic, compliant multilingual scientific textsâ€”overcoming the small data challenge and heterogeneity in biosimilar regulatory documentation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a GCN-embedded GAN where the generator incorporates graph convolutional layers encoding regulatory approval process ontologies and multilingual linguistic structures, producing synthetic scientific texts that follow regulatory compliance rules. The discriminator evaluates language quality, regulatory adherence, and cross-lingual consistency. The approach enables dataset expansion with realistic, compliance-aware samples for downstream LM training.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct regulatory approval graphs from biosimilar regulations and align with multilingual lexicons; 2) Implement GCN layers capturing this structured knowledge fed into GAN generator; 3) Train discriminator with real regulatory multilingual documents; 4) Generate synthetic datasets; 5) Evaluate dataset quality using perplexity, regulatory compliance checks, diversity metrics; 6) Fine-tune LM on synthetic data and measure improvement over baselines trained only on real data.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Seed regulatory concepts graph with associated bilingual terminologies. Output: Synthetic bilingual regulatory approval document segments maintaining semantic and regulatory fidelity, e.g., a French-English biosimilar approval summary with compliant terminology and structure.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If GCN-GAN struggles to converge, ablate to simpler GAN models augmented with regulatory templates or employ variational autoencoders (VAEs) combined with external high-quality bilingual corpora. Alternatively, simulate partial regulatory graphs or use rule-based text generators."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal lacks clarity on how graph convolutional layers will effectively encode the complex regulatory approval ontologies alongside multilingual linguistic features within the GAN generator. Specifically, how the heterogeneous graph information is integrated and how the compliance rules are operationalized in the generation process require more detailed mechanistic explanation and justification, to ensure the approach is theoretically and practically sound for this challenging domain and task complexity. Elaborating the interplay between the GCN and GAN components with illustrative architectural details would enhance confidence in soundness and reproducibility of the methodology, helping address potential modeling challenges upfront, such as convergence or mode collapse issues in GAN training over structured inputs and multilingual outputs. Consider clarifying or augmenting with preliminary experiments or ablation plans that explicitly test these architectural design choices and their impact on compliance and multilingual fidelity outputs, to support robustness of the core mechanism assumed here. This will strengthen the core technical narrative and the premise that combining GCN with GAN is the right design choice for this problem setup, beyond intuition or superficial analogy to related works in NLP or regulatory AI that you might cite in the full paper later on.  Targeting this will elevate research soundness and reviewer confidence substantially."

          "feedback_content": "To advance novelty beyond the current competitive baseline, consider integrating fuzzy sets and intelligent systems concepts to flexibly model the inherent uncertainty and vagueness present in regulatory compliance criteria and multilingual semantics. For instance, fuzzy logic could be employed within the graph encoding stage or the discriminator component to allow soft compliance evaluation or graded semantic consistency measures between generated texts and regulatory ontologies. Incorporating intelligent system techniques such as adaptive feedback loops or reinforcement learning agents could further fine-tune generation quality dynamically during GAN training or fine-tuning, improving compliance adherence and cross-lingual consistency. This fusion could not only boost the impact by producing more robust and interpretable synthetic datasets but significantly elevate novelty by demonstrating an innovative combination of symbolic reasoning, uncertainty modeling, and generative text synthesis in a challenging multilingual regulatory domain. Exploring these directions as extensions or optional modules could provide new pathways to surpass competitive baselines and appeal to a broader interdisciplinary audience."
