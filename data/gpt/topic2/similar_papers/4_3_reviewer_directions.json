    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of models capturing semantic relational structures grounded in embodied cognition severely limits understanding of human concept emergence across vision and language.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external novel gap highlighting missing integration of cross-modal semantic relationships and embodied cognition aspects, leveraging vision-language tasks and human-object interactions revealed as hidden bridges.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a multi-modal semantic graph embedding framework where nodes represent concepts from visual and linguistic domains with edges encoding embodied interaction relations (e.g., affordances, physical interactions). Use graph neural networks augmented with vector symbolic embedding representations as node features. Incorporate priors derived from embodied cognition literature (e.g., sensorimotor contingencies) as edge weighting and structural constraints.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Build a knowledge graph from datasets like Visual Genome, ConceptNet enriched with embodied cognition cues.\n2. Encode node features with multimodal embeddings from vision-language models.\n3. Train graph neural networks to learn embeddings predictive of conceptual similarity and interaction likelihood.\n4. Validate embeddings on tasks requiring prediction of affordances and semantic plausibility.\n5. Compare with purely linguistic or visual embeddings and test alignment with human conceptual judgments.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Nodes for 'cup', 'handle', 'grasping' linked with edges encoding interaction.\nExpected Output: Embeddings capturing that 'handle' affords 'grasping' related to 'cup'; semantic queries return appropriate interaction predictions.\nExample query: \"Which object part allows grasping?\" Output: \"handle\".",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If graph refinement with embodied priors is problematic, initially use purely data-driven edges and iteratively add symbolic constraints. Alternatively, use simplified interaction vocabularies to limit complexity."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks clarity on how embodied cognition priors will be quantitatively integrated and validated within the multi-modal semantic graph embeddings. Specifically, details on how sensorimotor contingencies as priors transform edge weighting and structural constraints need elaboration to assess feasibility. It is advisable to include a defined protocol for acquiring, encoding, and verifying these priors, perhaps through ablation studies comparing versions with and without such constraints, to ensure scientific rigor and reproducibility in training and evaluation phases. Additionally, potential challenges in scaling from symbolic embodied cues to data-driven multimodal embeddings should be anticipated with contingency strategies beyond the simplistic fallback plan presented, as this will impact practical implementation and results’ validity. We recommend involving iterative validation loops with human conceptual judgment benchmarks early to track alignment progress and feasibility effectively within the proposed timeline and resources constraints in the experiment plan section, enhancing its practicality and impact confidence throughout the research process. This step is vital to bridge theory with applied model training and ensure that the embodied cognition theory is not just nominally included but operationalized effectively in the embedding learning pipeline.  \n\nTo summarize, refining the experimental plan to explicitly address encoding and validation of embodied priors, detailed contingencies for integration difficulties, and milestones aligning with human judgment data will significantly strengthen the feasibility and clarity of the methodology presented in the Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan sections.  This would increase reviewer confidence regarding practicability and scientific rigor of the work's core methodological contributions and empirical evaluations, crucial for acceptance in top conferences with strong applied-ML expectations and cognitive modeling standards.   \n\n(Section targets: Proposed_Method, Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)    \n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and the foundational cognitive science roots of the work, we suggest explicitly integrating representational similarity analysis (RSA) from cognitive neuroscience and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on motor system involvement or semantic word categories into the evaluation framework. This integration can address the impact and novelty challenges by grounding embeddings not only in symbolic priors but aligning them directly against neural and behavioral data reflecting embodied cognition. Incorporating such cross-disciplinary validation would position the approach at the intersection of AI, cognitive model, and neuroimaging fields, addressing broader research communities and enhancing the work’s impact. \n\nA practical path is to compare learned semantic graph embeddings’ similarity structures with human brain representational similarity matrices obtained from event-related fMRI experiments studying processing of concrete and abstract words, affordances, or motor-related semantic categories. This can be operationalized as an additional task in the validation pipeline, strengthening claims about the cognitive plausibility of the model and its embeddings while enriching novelty beyond conventional vision-language or graph embedding works. Such global linkage also opens the door to future extensions involving brain-inspired spiking neural networks or hardware-software co-design approaches in AI. \n\nWe recommend explicitly framing the work within this neuro-cognitive evaluation framework in the motivation and evaluation sections to broaden its impact and align with next-generation AI and cognitive neuroscience trends, increasing chances of acceptance in premier interdisciplinary venues like NeurIPS or ACL. \n\n(Section targets: Motivation, Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, Validation Tasks)"
