    "title": "Graph-Enhanced AI Agents for Hypothesis-Driven Self-Driving Laboratories",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current self-driving laboratories (SDLs) lack robust AI-driven hypothesis generation rooted in interpretable scientific reasoning, leading to inefficient experimental planning and constrained discovery rates.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the hidden bridge between complex question answering and materials discovery, this project directly tackles the external gap involving the absent integration of question-answering systems with SDLs. This aims to overcome hallucinations by anchoring hypothesis generation in domain knowledge graphs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We design an AI agent architecture combining a graph-augmented complex question-answering module with experiment control in SDLs. The AI agent queries a domain-specific knowledge graph to produce interpretable hypotheses, which the SDL then prioritizes for experimental validation. A feedback loop updates the graph with new results, refining future hypothesis proposals.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop a materials science knowledge graph focusing on catalytic materials. 2) Integrate a graph-enhanced QA module trained on scientific literature into an SDL simulation environment. 3) Implement active experiment planning algorithms guided by AI-generated hypotheses. 4) Benchmark against SDLs using only statistical or black-box optimization methods in simulated materials discovery workflows. Evaluation metrics cover discovery rate, experiment efficiency, and hypothesis validity.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Suggest promising alloy compositions for high-temperature superconductors based on existing data and theories.' Output: A ranked list of compositions with explanatory annotations linked to graph nodes (material properties, theory). SDL conducts prioritized experiments and reports validation results, updating the knowledge graph accordingly.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If the QA grounding is insufficient, incorporate reinforcement learning to improve hypothesis generation quality via simulated reward signals. Alternatively, perform incremental graph construction from experimental logs to enhance domain coverage."
