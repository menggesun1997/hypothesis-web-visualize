  "prompt": "You are a world-class research strategist and data synthesizer. Your mission is to analyze a curated set of research papers and their underlying conceptual structure to produce a comprehensive 'Landscape Map' that reveals the current state, critical gaps, and novel opportunities in the field of **Investigating the Role of Language Models in Modeling Human Concept Formation**.\n\n### Part A: Foundational Literature\nHere are the core similar research papers, which includes the paperId, title and abstract.\n```text\n[{'paper_id': 1, 'title': 'Why concepts are (probably) vectors', 'abstract': 'For decades, cognitive scientists have debated what kind of representation might characterize human concepts. Whatever the format of the representation, it must allow for the computation of varied properties, including similarities, features, categories, definitions, and relations. It must also support the development of theories, ad hoc categories, and knowledge of procedures. Here, we discuss why vector-based representations provide a compelling account that can meet all these needs while being plausibly encoded into neural architectures. This view has become especially promising with recent advances in both large language models and vector symbolic architectures. These innovations show how vectors can handle many properties traditionally thought to be out of reach for neural models, including compositionality, definitions, structures, and symbolic computational processes.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Divergences in color perception between deep neural networks and humans', 'abstract': 'Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly proposed as models of human vision, bolstered by their impressive performance on image classification and object recognition tasks. Yet, the extent to which DNNs capture fundamental aspects of human vision such as color perception remains unclear. Here, we develop novel experiments for evaluating the perceptual coherence of color embeddings in DNNs, and we assess how well these algorithms predict human color similarity judgments collected via an online survey. We find that state-of-the-art DNN architectures - including convolutional neural networks and vision transformers - provide color similarity judgments that strikingly diverge from human color judgments of (i) images with controlled color properties, (ii) images generated from online searches, and (iii) real-world images from the canonical CIFAR-10 dataset. We compare DNN performance against an interpretable and cognitively plausible model of color perception based on wavelet decomposition, inspired by foundational theories in computational neuroscience. While one deep learning model - a convolutional DNN trained on a style transfer task - captures some aspects of human color perception, our wavelet algorithm provides more coherent color embeddings that better predict human color judgments compared to all DNNs we examine. These results hold when altering the high-level visual task used to train similar DNN architectures (e.g., image classification versus image segmentation), as well as when examining the color embeddings of different layers in a given DNN architecture. These findings break new ground in the effort to analyze the perceptual representations of machine learning algorithms and to improve their ability to serve as cognitively plausible models of human vision. Implications for machine learning, human perception, and embodied cognition are discussed.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'An Integrated Model of Semantics and Control', 'abstract': 'Understanding the mechanisms enabling the learning and flexible use of knowledge in context-appropriate ways has been a major focus of research in the study of both semantic cognition and cognitive control. We present a unified model of semantics and control that addresses these questions from both perspectives. The model provides a coherent view of how semantic knowledge, and the ability to flexibly access and deploy that knowledge to meet current task demands, arises from end-to-end learning of the statistics of the environment. We show that the model addresses unresolved issues from both literatures, including how control operates over features that covary with one another and how control representations themselves are structured and emerge through learning, through a series of behavioral experiments and simulations. We conclude by discussing the implications of our approach to other fundamental questions in cognitive science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

Traditionally, such computational models have been hand-designed by expert researchers. Two prominent examples are cognitive architectures and Bayesian models of cognition. Although the former requires the specification of a fixed set of computational structures and a definition of how these structures interact with each other, the latter necessitates the commitment to a particular prior and a likelihood function that - in combination with Bayes' rule - determine the model's behavior. In recent years, a new framework has established itself as a promising tool for building models of human cognition: the framework of meta-learning. In contrast to the previously mentioned model classes, meta-learned models acquire their inductive biases from experience, that is, by repeatedly interacting with an environment. However, a coherent research program around meta-learned models of cognition is still missing to date. The purpose of this article is to synthesize previous work in this field and establish such a research program. We accomplish this by pointing out that meta-learning can be used to construct Bayes-optimal learning algorithms, allowing us to draw strong connections to the rational analysis of cognition. We then discuss several advantages of the meta-learning framework over traditional methods and reexamine prior work in the context of these new insights.\"}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'The added value of affective processes for models of human cognition and learning', 'abstract': \"Building on the affectivism approach, we expand on Binz et al.'s meta-learning research program by highlighting that emotion and other affective phenomena should be key to the modeling of human learning. We illustrate the added value of affective processes for models of learning across multiple domains with a focus on reinforcement learning, knowledge acquisition, and social learning.\"}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Meta-learning: Data, architecture, and both', 'abstract': 'We are encouraged by the many positive commentaries on our target article. In this response, we recapitulate some of the points raised and identify synergies between them. We have arranged our response based on the tension between data and architecture that arises in the meta-learning framework. We additionally provide a short discussion that touches upon connections to foundation models.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Is human compositionality meta-learned?', 'abstract': 'Recent studies suggest that meta-learning may provide an original solution to an enduring puzzle about whether neural networks can explain compositionality - in particular, by raising the prospect that compositionality can be understood as an emergent property of an inner-loop learning algorithm. We elaborate on this hypothesis and consider its empirical predictions regarding the neural mechanisms and development of human compositionality.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Probabilistic programming versus meta-learning as models of cognition', 'abstract': 'We summarize the recent progress made by probabilistic programming as a unifying formalism for the probabilistic, symbolic, and data-driven aspects of human cognition. We highlight differences with meta-learning in flexibility, statistical assumptions and inferences about cogniton. We suggest that the meta-learning approach could be further strengthened by considering Connectionist <i>and</i> Bayesian approaches, rather than exclusively one or the other.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "title": "Research Landscape Map for Investigating the Role of Language Models in Modeling Human Concept Formation",
    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem in this research cluster revolves around understanding and modeling human concept formation through computational frameworks, prominently leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) and vector-based representations. Core focuses include how language models and Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA) can computationally instantiate human concepts, capturing their compositionality, symbolic reasoning, and semantic flexibility. Thematically, research divides into two main clusters: one emphasizing human vision modeled by convolutional and transformer DNN architectures with emphasis on perceptual features like color embeddings and cognitively plausible models; the other focusing on language models and symbolic architectures for representing and manipulating concepts as vectors supporting symbolic computations. Dominant methodologies involve integrating deep learning with symbolic computation paradigms, meta-learning frameworks for emergent cognitive capabilities, and evaluating DNNs’ alignment with human cognitive processes. Meta-learning emerges as a key paradigm for end-to-end learning of semantic control and compositionality, while vector-based semantic spaces underpin concept representation strategies.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite progress, deep neural networks, especially in vision and language, show divergence from human cognitive representations (e.g., color perception mismatches), indicating limitations in their fidelity as cognitively plausible models. Bridge nodes highlight that while deep neural networks serve as structural connectors, there is insufficient integration between vision-based DNNs and language model representations, impeding unified models of concept formation encompassing multi-modal abstraction. Furthermore, meta-learned models remain underdeveloped regarding affective and control processes, limiting comprehensive cognitive modeling. External/Novel Gaps: The Global Context reveals a significant hidden bridge between 'human vision' and 'language models' via vision-language tasks, human-object interactions, and semantic relational embeddings—areas not sufficiently addressed in the local cluster. This gap suggests underexploited opportunities for leveraging large-scale vision-language pretraining and benchmark datasets to create unified models that better capture how humans form concepts grounded both in perceptual experience and linguistic abstraction. Current models largely miss integrating cross-modal semantic relationships and embodied cognition aspects crucial for human concept emergence.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate vision-language models (from the hidden bridge linking 'human vision' and 'language models') with vector symbolic architectures (local thematic island on symbolic computation) to create multi-modal, cognitively plausible concept representations that better reflect human cross-modal semantic integration, addressing internal gaps in modality isolation.\n\nOpportunity 2: Extend meta-learning frameworks for semantics and control by incorporating affective processes (from paper 5) and embodiment cues derived from human-object interaction datasets highlighted in the global analysis, to model more flexible, context-sensitive, and affectively informed concept formation mechanisms.\n\nOpportunity 3: Develop interpretable models that bridge convolutional and transformer-based architectures used for vision tasks with symbolic computational processes in language models, leveraging large-scale pre-trained multi-modal data (e.g., visual descriptions, interaction recognition benchmarks) to improve fidelity to human perceptual and conceptual judgments, thus resolving divergences like in color perception judgments by deep neural networks."
