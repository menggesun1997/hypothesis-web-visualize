    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs lack explicit cognitive stage representations, limiting their ability to mirror human linguistic processing stages and to interpret complex constructions.",
    "Motivation": "Targets an internal gap by introducing neurocognitive grounding into LLMs through aligning their latent embeddings with neural signatures associated with cognitive processing stages of language, enhancing interpretability and cognitive fidelity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a training paradigm where LLM embedding spaces are regularized using fMRI and EEG datasets capturing human brain responses at different cognitive stages during language tasks. Introduce auxiliary losses to enforce embedding similarity with cognitive stage patterns, thereby encoding processing dynamics within model representations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multimodal neuroimaging data correlated with linguistic tasks. 2) Extract cognitive stage markers. 3) Integrate alignment losses into LLM training/fine-tuning. 4) Evaluate on linguistic prediction tasks and model-to-brain mapping accuracy.",

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan relies heavily on collecting high-quality multimodal neuroimaging data (fMRI and EEG) aligned with language tasks, which is known to be expensive, time-consuming, and requires considerable expertise in cognitive neuroscience and data preprocessing. Moreover, integrating auxiliary losses for embedding alignment assumes stable and generalizable cognitive stage markers can be robustly extracted and consistently mapped to LLM embeddings, which is nontrivial. You should clarify the specifics of how cognitive stage markers are defined and extracted, address potential dataset limitations, and consider scalable or publicly available neuroimaging datasets to bolster feasibility. Additionally, details on managing noise, variability in brain data, and the technical approach for embedding alignment loss computation and stability during LLM training would strengthen practical feasibility arguments and experimental rigor. Without addressing these challenges concretely, feasibility remains questionable at this ambitious scale and complexity level.\n\nConsider including modular experiments validating each step independently before full integration, e.g., testing cognitive stage marker extraction and embedding alignment separately, to de-risk the pipeline and clarify experimental feasibility paths for reviewers and implementers alike.\n\nOverall, the experiment plan needs more concrete operational details, risk management, and resource considerations to be deemed feasible for a premier conference contribution at this scope and complexity level. Identifying existing datasets or collaborations with neuroscience labs would improve confidence in execution ability and reproducibility prospects.\n\nRecommended fix: elaborate data sources, marker extraction methodologies, integration procedures, and fallback plans for noisy data or poor alignment performance within the experiment plan to enhance clarity and feasibility assessment."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment marked this work as NOV-COMPETITIVE, the proposal would benefit significantly by integrating meta-learning frameworks to improve model adaptability across varying cognitive stages and linguistic contexts. For example, adopting a meta-learning approach could enable the model to rapidly adjust embedding alignment strategies conditioned on different neurocognitive states or task demands, thus enhancing generalization and robustness.\n\nSpecifically, framing the embedding alignment as a meta-learning problem where the model learns how to align embeddings with brain signals across multiple tasks or datasets might increase impact and novelty. This could also help mitigate data scarcity issues by leveraging meta-learned priors, allowing the model to better handle variability in cognitive stage signatures.\n\nAdditionally, meta-learning could facilitate personalizing models to individual neuroimaging patterns, advancing both interpretability and cognitive fidelity. Exploring this angle and framing it clearly in the proposal could elevate its competitiveness by connecting the strong but competitive neuro-linguistic alignment approach to a cutting-edge, globally linked conceptual framework.\n\nI recommend explicitly incorporating a meta-learning component or at least discussing its potential integration as a future direction, to broaden impact and position the work more distinctively within the current research landscape."
