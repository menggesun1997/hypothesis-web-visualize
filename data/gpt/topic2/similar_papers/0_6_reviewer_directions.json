          "feedback_content": "The proposed stepwise experimental plan lacks clarity on data availability, preprocessing, and integration challenges associated with heterogeneous data types (multiomics, imaging, clinical notes). Given the complexity of training multimodal transformers with contrastive objectives, it would be critical to specify how cohort data will be sourced, curated, and balanced to ensure meaningful alignment and disentanglement across modalities. Additionally, evaluation metrics beyond classification accuracy, particularly for interpretability validation, need clearer definition and systematic clinical validation protocols, to realistically assess both model utility and domain relevance rather than relying mainly on feature attribution heuristics. Strengthening these aspects will enhance the practical feasibility and robustness of the study outcomes in precision medicine contexts, which are known to be data sensitive and clinically nuanced. The experiment plan should also incorporate contingency strategies related to data sparsity or missing modalities rather than only fallback on increased supervision techniques, to be more comprehensive and scientifically rigorous in addressing real-world challenges inherent to multimodal clinical data integration and contrastive learning frameworks.  \n\nTherefore, I recommend expanding the experiment section with detailed data acquisition strategies, preprocessing pipelines, modality integration techniques, comprehensive interpretability evaluation with clinical expert involvement, and explicit handling of realistic data limitations to improve overall feasibility and credibility of the proposed research framework.  \n\nIn summary: enhance experimental design specificity and rigor around data and evaluation to confirm the method's practical viability and replicate the clinical interpretability claims convincingly in precision medicine applications.  \n\n--- Suggested Target Section: \"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\" for improved experimental detail and feasibility clarity.  \n--- Feedback code: [FEA-EXPERIMENT]  \n--- Importance: Primary critical item to address for practical success and acceptance."

          "feedback_content": "Given the current NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment signaling strong existing related work, a valuable enhancement would be to integrate domain-specific biomedical knowledge explicitly into the model architecture or training objectives. For example, embedding disease ontologies, known biological pathways, or leveraging multiple instance learning techniques that are prevalent in precision oncology can provide grounded supervisory signals complementary to contrastive learning. Additionally, combining state-of-the-art deep learning approaches in unsupervised and supervised paradigms, such as integrating tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte quantification or quantitative structure-activity relationship insights, could amplify model interpretability and disease relevance. Such global interdisciplinary linkage to advanced biomedical AI methods can substantially boost both novelty and impact by grounding multimodal embeddings with mechanistic biological priors and clinically validated biomarkers, thereby positioning the research uniquely within the competitive landscape.  \n\nSpecifically, this could be operationalized by augmenting the contrastive learning framework with modality-aware prior knowledge constraints or prototype regularizations guided by biologically meaningful feature groups derived from external curated databases or expert annotations, beyond the fallback plan of manual supervision. This approach will leverage the globally linked concepts effectively, enhancing the model’s disease factor disentanglement and interpretability, and providing a clearer pathway for clinical translation and adoption in precision medicine diagnostics and treatment planning.  \n\nTherefore, I strongly recommend incorporating a strategy that systematically integrates biomedical domain knowledge and advanced supervised or MIL-based techniques alongside the core contrastive approach to substantially elevate the project’s novelty, impact, and translational potential within a highly competitive research space.  \n\n--- Suggested Target Section: \"Proposed_Method\" for incorporating global biomedical AI concepts and practical fusion techniques.  \n--- Feedback code: [SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION]  \n--- Importance: Strategic enhancement to maximize novelty and impact given the competitive area."
