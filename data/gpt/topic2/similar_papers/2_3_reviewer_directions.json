    "title": "Wavelet-Enhanced Language Model Interpretability for Regulatory Multilingual Science",
    "Problem_Statement": "Language models applied to multilingual scientific texts are often black boxes, limiting interpretability and regulatory auditability essential for compliance in biomedical domains with limited data.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap of regulatory-compliant interpretability by leveraging continuous wavelet transform techniques, traditionally used in medical signal processing, to reveal multi-scale language feature patterns enhancing explainability of multilingual LMs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Incorporate continuous wavelet transform modules within transformer attention layers to analyze hierarchical linguistic features in scientific texts across languages. These wavelet features serve as interpretable signals aligning with biomedical regulatory criteria, facilitating transparent decision traces in LM outputs for compliance auditing.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement wavelet transform integration in attention mechanisms; 2) Fine-tune on multilingual biosimilar datasets; 3) Compare interpretability with conventional attention maps using regulatory keyword alignment metrics; 4) Evaluate translation fidelity, compliance relevance, and user interpretability via expert review; 5) Benchmark using BLEU, interpretability scores, and regulatory audit pass rates.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multilingual regulatory paragraph describing drug safety measures. Output: Attention visualizations at wavelet scales highlighting compliance-relevant terms, and model-generated summaries explaining decision basis for regulatory review.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If wavelet integration complicates training stability, use discrete wavelet transforms or alternative time-frequency analysis methods. Also consider hybrid post-hoc interpretability tools combining model outputs with regulatory lexicon overlays."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-MECHANISM",
          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks detailed clarity on how continuous wavelet transform (CWT) modules are concretely integrated within transformer attention layers. As transformers operate on discrete tokens and CWT is typically applied on continuous signals, the mechanism for bridging these modalities, handling discrete multilingual text input, and backpropagation through wavelet features is not well articulated. Clarify the mathematical formulation and architectural modifications enabling this integration, including how wavelet features are extracted, fused, and interpreted within the attention process, to establish a sound and reproducible method design framework that reviewers and practitioners can trust and build upon. Without this clarity, the novelty and effectiveness claims remain speculative and undermine both soundness and feasibility assessments. Please provide algorithmic or architectural schematics and explain implications for model complexity and training stability explicitly in Proposed_Method section to solidify soundness of approach and help reviewers gauge feasibility with respect to multilingual biomedical regulatory texts complexity and limited data settings."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and the focus on interpretability for regulatory multilingual biomedical texts, the proposal can strongly benefit from integrating concepts from 'Explainable Artificial Intelligence' and 'data-centric AI'. Specifically, consider complementing the wavelet-based interpretability signals with user-centered post-hoc explanation mechanisms, such as interactive visualization dashboards combining wavelet attention patterns with domain-specific electronic health records (EHR) features or regulatory lexicons. Incorporate data-centric AI practices to curate or augment multilingual biomedical datasets tailored to regulatory scenarios, strengthening model generalizability and interpretability relevance under low-resource conditions. Linking the wavelet-enhanced approach with these globally relevant concepts can broaden impact, improve compliance auditability, and position the work distinctively beyond prior art in explainability and biomedical NLP, thereby addressing core reviewer concerns about novelty and practical utility."
