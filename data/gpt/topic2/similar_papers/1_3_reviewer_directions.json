    "title": "Interactive AI Tutors for Enhancing Scientific Problem-Solving and Computational Literacy",
    "Problem_Statement": "Scientific researchers need improved tools to augment problem-solving skills and computational literacy for effective AI-human collaboration in advancing deep learning theory, but existing AI tools provide limited interactive learning and interpretive support.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by the hidden bridge linking learning research and material design, we address the gap in augmenting human-AI teamwork through interactive AI-driven instruction tailored for scientific discovery contexts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We design an AI tutor platform combining an LLM with embedded domain knowledge graphs and instructional design principles. The system interactively guides users through complex problem-solving scenarios in materials science and deep learning theory, providing contextual explanations, debugging, and adaptive learning pathways to enhance computational literacy and scientific reasoning.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop instructional modules targeting AI reasoning tasks relevant to materials design. 2) Integrate LLM and knowledge graph-based hint generation with interactive query support. 3) Implement adaptive learning algorithms based on user performance. 4) Conduct user studies with researchers assessing skill improvement and collaboration efficacy. Metrics include problem-solving success rate, user satisfaction, and knowledge retention.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User attempts to design a novel neural architecture for property prediction and queries 'Why does this architecture perform poorly on out-of-distribution samples?' Output: The tutor provides an explanation based on overfitting, suggests regularization strategies, and walks the user through redesign steps with illustrative examples.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If tutoring feedback is not effective, incorporate multimodal explanations (diagrams, interactive visualizations). Alternatively, incorporate peer collaboration simulations or transfer learning from expert user data to improve teaching strategies."
