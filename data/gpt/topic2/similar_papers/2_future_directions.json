        "title": "CNN-Infused Regulatory-Compliant Multilingual LM",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing language models struggle to integrate multilingual scientific communication effectively while respecting complex biomedical regulatory requirements, especially given the small, noisy, and heterogeneous data scenario.",
        "Motivation": "This idea targets the critical internal gap of adapting sophisticated CNN techniques (residual blocks, continuous wavelet transform) into small-data-centric language model fine-tuning for interpretable, regulatory-aware multilingual language processing, as identified under the hidden bridge analysis between CNNs and approval processes.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid language model architecture where convolutional modules with residual blocks and continuous wavelet transform layers preprocess multilingual biomedical text embeddings to extract robust, regulatory-relevant features. This output feeds into a transformer-based language model fine-tuned on limited, multilingual biosimilar datasets with regularization reflecting regulatory compliance constraints (e.g., interpretability and auditability losses). The framework includes constraints mimicking regulatory validation checkpoints as training feedback.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multilingual biosimilar scientific corpora with regulatory annotations and limited size; 2) Implement CNN modules with residual blocks and continuous wavelet transform preprocessing; 3) Integrate with transformer-based LM fine-tuning; 4) Baselines: vanilla transformer LM fine-tuning, CNN-alone, and non-CWT language models; 5) Metrics: BLEU for communication fidelity, interpretability scores (feature relevance), regulatory compliance proxies, and robustness on noisy inputs; 6) Cross-validate across languages and biosimilar contexts.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Scientific abstract in Spanish describing a biosimilar clinical trial with regulatory terms. Expected output: Accurate, compliant English summary highlighting key regulatory elements with explainable model attention aligning to regulatory keywords.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the CNN modules fail to enhance performance, fallback to ablation removing continuous wavelet transform layers, or replace CNN modules with graph convolutional networks representing regulatory knowledge graphs. Employ data augmentation via GANs to compensate for small data."

        "title": "Synthetic Regulatory-Compliant Multilingual Text Generation via GCN-GAN",
        "Problem_Statement": "Scarcity of standardized, large multilingual datasets capturing complex regulatory approval language constrains robust ML model training for scientific communication in biosimilar contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap revealing potential in combining graph convolutional networks and GANs informed by regulatory knowledge to synthesize realistic, compliant multilingual scientific textsâ€”overcoming the small data challenge and heterogeneity in biosimilar regulatory documentation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a GCN-embedded GAN where the generator incorporates graph convolutional layers encoding regulatory approval process ontologies and multilingual linguistic structures, producing synthetic scientific texts that follow regulatory compliance rules. The discriminator evaluates language quality, regulatory adherence, and cross-lingual consistency. The approach enables dataset expansion with realistic, compliance-aware samples for downstream LM training.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct regulatory approval graphs from biosimilar regulations and align with multilingual lexicons; 2) Implement GCN layers capturing this structured knowledge fed into GAN generator; 3) Train discriminator with real regulatory multilingual documents; 4) Generate synthetic datasets; 5) Evaluate dataset quality using perplexity, regulatory compliance checks, diversity metrics; 6) Fine-tune LM on synthetic data and measure improvement over baselines trained only on real data.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Seed regulatory concepts graph with associated bilingual terminologies. Output: Synthetic bilingual regulatory approval document segments maintaining semantic and regulatory fidelity, e.g., a French-English biosimilar approval summary with compliant terminology and structure.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If GCN-GAN struggles to converge, ablate to simpler GAN models augmented with regulatory templates or employ variational autoencoders (VAEs) combined with external high-quality bilingual corpora. Alternatively, simulate partial regulatory graphs or use rule-based text generators."

        "Motivation": "This project addresses the critical gaps around lack of real-time adaptive models and standardized validation pipelines by blending engineering advances in fast ML deployment with regulatory approval knowledge to build a dynamic validation system bridging multilingual adaptation and regulatory checks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create an end-to-end pipeline that integrates continuous model adaptation modules with multilingual context detection and regulatory compliance validation engines. The pipeline monitors deployed LM outputs, performs incremental domain-specific fine-tuning with continuous validation against regulatory constraints, and provides audit trails and compliance certificates using explainable AI components inspired by clinical ML deployments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop pipeline components: adaptive fine-tuning, multilingual detection, compliance checking modules; 2) Collect biosimilar multilingual corpora and regulatory checklists; 3) Deploy prototype on streaming multilingual scientific communications; 4) Evaluate response time, adaptability to new domains/languages, compliance accuracy, interpretability of system decisions; 5) Benchmark against standard static LM deployment.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: New biosimilar clinical study report in Korean requiring English summarization while verifying compliance with EU regulatory standards. Output: Real-time compliant summary with dynamic model adaptation and audit log of compliance checkpoints passed.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic adaptation causes instability, implement scheduled batch updates or employ fallback static models validated thoroughly offline. Alternatively, use human-in-the-loop mechanisms for compliance validation during adaptation phases."

These wavelet features serve as interpretable signals aligning with biomedical regulatory criteria, facilitating transparent decision traces in LM outputs for compliance auditing.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement wavelet transform integration in attention mechanisms; 2) Fine-tune on multilingual biosimilar datasets; 3) Compare interpretability with conventional attention maps using regulatory keyword alignment metrics; 4) Evaluate translation fidelity, compliance relevance, and user interpretability via expert review; 5) Benchmark using BLEU, interpretability scores, and regulatory audit pass rates.",
