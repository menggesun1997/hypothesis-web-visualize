    "title": "Unified Multi-Modal Contrastive Learning with Symbolic Control for Concept Disambiguation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Ambiguity in concept formation due to insufficient multi-modal integration and lack of explicit symbolic control limits fidelity to human semantic judgments.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses both internal and external gaps by uniting vision-language contrastive pretraining with symbolic control mechanisms for disambiguation, inspired by opportunities one and three.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Propose a contrastive learning framework where vision-language pairs are encoded into symbolic representations controlled by an explicit disambiguation module. The symbolic control modulates embeddings to emphasize context-relevant concept features, using vector symbolic operators. Unified training optimizes cross-modal alignment and symbolic disambiguation objectives.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use paired datasets like Flickr30k with disambiguation annotations.\n2. Pretrain vision and language encoders with contrastive loss.\n3. Train symbolic control modules using labeled ambiguous concept examples.\n4. Evaluate on benchmarks measuring concept disambiguation accuracy and semantic similarity.\n5. Conduct ablation on the role of symbolic control.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Image of bank river vs. caption \"I went to the bank to withdraw money.\"\nExpected Output: Correct disambiguated concept embedding reflecting the financial institution rather than the river bank, guided by symbolic control.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If symbolic control does not improve disambiguation, test simpler rule-based gating or increase size and diversity of disambiguation training set."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines using a symbolic control module to modulate embeddings using vector symbolic operators, yet the explanation of how this module interfaces concretely with the contrastive learning framework is under-specified. Details on the architecture of the symbolic control, how it is integrated during joint training, and how it explicitly enforces disambiguation need to be clearly delineated. Clarifying this mechanism is crucial to validate the conceptual novelty and to ensure reproducibility by others in the community. Consider providing algorithmic steps or schematic diagrams illustrating the flow between vision-language encoders and symbolic control during training and inference phases within your final submission to strengthen soundness and clarity of the approach. This will help reviewers and readers judge feasibility and correctness more confidently in this competitive area."

          "feedback_content": "Given the ideaâ€™s evaluation as 'NOV-COMPETITIVE', it would benefit greatly from linking to broader recent advances in language models, particularly those that unify multi-modal understanding with symbolic reasoning. For greater impact and novelty, consider extending the symbolic control module to incorporate or interact with pre-trained large-scale language models for human-like reasoning about ambiguous concepts. This could include leveraging prompt-based disambiguation or fine-tuning LM-generated constraints alongside your symbolic control for deeper semantic alignment. Such integration could elevate both the disambiguation fidelity and scope, enabling the framework to better evaluate deep neural networks' comprehension of complex, ambiguous multi-modal inputs as encountered in real human tasks. This targeted augmentation aligns well with your motivation and could address novelty concerns by bringing in cutting-edge connections to emerging language model capabilities."
