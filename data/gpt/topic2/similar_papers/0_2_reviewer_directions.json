    "title": "Semantic-Enriched Self-Supervised Framework for Aphasia Subtyping",
    "Problem_Statement": "Clinical language disorder modeling suffers from limited annotated data and poor semantic integration, reducing LLM interpretability and diagnostic accuracy for disorders like aphasia.",
    "Motivation": "Targets internal gap of data scarcity and external gap around applying annotation frameworks from low-resource languages to improve semantic knowledge embedding within clinical language models, enhancing interpretability and efficacy.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a self-supervised learning framework that incorporates semantic annotation strategies and cross-lingual transfer from low-resource language models. This includes an intermediate semantic representation layer trained with weak supervision from clinical domain ontologies to enrich syntactic and pragmatic features relevant to aphasia subtyping.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compile multilingual aphasia speech/text datasets with minimal annotations. 2) Annotate partial semantic frames using adapted frameworks from low-resource language research. 3) Pretrain transformer models with masked language and semantic frame prediction tasks. 4) Evaluate model performance on aphasia subtype classification and interpretability via probing tasks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient utterance with disfluent speech texts. Output: Aphasia subtype label and highlighting of semantic frame deviations correlated with diagnostic markers.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If semantic enrichment yields marginal gains, incorporate longitudinal patient data and multimodal cues (e.g., speech melody) to complement text-based features."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method introduces an intermediate semantic representation layer trained with weak supervision from clinical ontologies, merging syntactic and pragmatic features. However, the mechanism by which semantic enrichment concretely enhances aphasia subtype classification and model interpretability is not fully detailed. Clarify the architecture of this semantic layer, how semantic frames are integrated into the transformer pretraining objectives, and how these representations differ or improve over standard masked language model pretraining. Articulating the connection between semantic frame prediction and downstream diagnostic tasks would strengthen confidence in soundness and potential impact of the approach, reducing ambiguity about how semantic knowledge effectively complements clinical language disorder modeling rather than adding complexity without clear gains. This elaboration is essential to validate the core assumption that semantic enrichment will lead to improved interpretability and classification accuracy for aphasia subtypes, given existing competitive methods that already leverage self-supervised models on clinical data with various annotations. Without this clarity, there is risk the mechanism remains too abstract and under-specified for reproducibility and evaluation by reviewers or practitioners familiar with clinical NLP and speech disorders research. Please provide a diagram or algorithmic description illustrating data flow and semantic feature fusion in the model architecture to better ground this proposal's mechanism section in sound engineering principles and clinical relevance evidence. \n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experimental plan lays out a reasonable roadmap of multilingual data compilation, partial semantic frame annotation, pretraining with dual masked language and semantic frame prediction objectives, and evaluation on subtype classification and interpretability probing. However, critical feasibility concerns remain regarding the scalability and validity of semantic annotation adapted from low-resource language frameworks to clinical aphasia datasets, which are limited and noisy. Given minimal existing annotations, the methodology for reliably annotating partial semantic frames needs concrete description—are domain experts involved, what quality control measures ensure annotation consistency, and how labor-intensive is this process? Without addressing these challenges, the plan risks infeasibility or suboptimal semantic annotations that could hinder model effectiveness. Furthermore, evaluation metrics for interpretability via probing tasks require specification: which probing datasets, linguistic phenomena, or semantic categories will be assessed? Lastly, the fallback plan involving multimodal cues like speech melody is promising but underdeveloped — clarifying how these modalities will be integrated in model architecture and training pipelines would improve practical resilience if semantic enrichment alone is insufficient. Strengthening these feasibility aspects will substantiate the experimental approach's viability and robustness to dataset and annotation constraints typical in clinical language disorder domains. \n\nTarget section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
