    "title": "Integrating Domain Semantic Frameworks Into LLMs for Clinical Language Disorders",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs lack explicit integration of domain-specific semantic frameworks critical for interpreting clinical linguistic disorders such as aphasia, leading to limited explanatory power.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external/novel gap related to embedding cognitive and domain-specific semantic frameworks into AI systems beyond data-driven models to improve clinical interpretability and diagnosis.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Augment LLM architectures with dedicated semantic frame modules pretrained on clinical ontologies and cognitive linguistic theories. Employ a two-stream architecture where one stream models language generatively while another enforces compliance with semantic constraints, combined via a gated fusion mechanism enhancing interpretability and diagnostic reasoning.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate clinical linguistic semantic frameworks and associated textual data. 2) Pretrain semantic modules separately. 3) Integrate with decoder-only or encoder-decoder LLMs. 4) Evaluate on aphasia detection and explanation tasks, comparing with standard LLM baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient narrative with syntactic anomalies. Output: LLM-generated diagnosis rationale citing specific semantic frame violations and cognitive stage markers.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If integration degrades generation quality, test partial semantic fine-tuning or post-hoc semantic explanation extraction methods."

However, the mechanism of how these semantic modules will be pretrained, integrated at the architectural level, and how exactly the gating fusion will enforce semantic compliance while maintaining generation fluency is insufficiently detailed. Clarify the architectural design, the interaction between streams during training and inference, and how conflicts between generative and semantic constraints are resolved to validate the soundness of the approach and to prevent potential degradation in generation quality beyond what is anticipated in the fallback plan. Providing preliminary sketches or pseudo-algorithms could strengthen this section significantly. This clarification is critical to build confidence in the proposed methodâ€™s feasibility and interpretability improvements in clinical settings, where explainability is paramount.

However, the plan lacks details regarding the specific clinical linguistic semantic frameworks and data sources to be used, the scale and annotation quality of the datasets, and criteria for evaluation metrics beyond aphasia detection accuracy. Moreover, it is not clear how the evaluation will quantify improvements in interpretability or diagnostic reasoning. Including more concrete experimental protocols for aligning semantic frames with cognitive stage markers, validation on multiple clinical datasets (e.g., electronic health records or picture description tasks), and approaches to mitigate potential dataset biases will enhance the practicality and robustness of the experimental plan. Additionally, a timeline or estimated resource requirements would help assess feasibility in a real-world research setting. Target Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
