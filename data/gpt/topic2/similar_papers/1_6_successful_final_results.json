        "title": "Collaborative Multi-Agent Graph-Guided LLMs for Transparent and Interactive Scientific Discovery Planning",
        "Problem_Statement": "Automated scientific discovery systems often produce valuable hypotheses and experimental plans, yet they struggle with transparency and interpretability, limiting trust and effective human-AI collaboration. Existing graph-guided LLM approaches lack clarity on the integration mechanisms and fail to leverage multi-agent collaboration, restricting creative and dynamic hypothesis generation.",
        "Motivation": "While graph-guided LLMs have advanced interpretability by linking hypotheses to knowledge graphs, these approaches remain NOV-COMPETITIVE due to ambiguous integration mechanisms and limited scope. Our work aims to transcend this by explicitly designing a multi-agent system where specialized LLM agents—each expert in synthesis planning, property prediction, or literature mining—collaborate through a shared knowledge graph interface. This joint framework enables richer, dynamically validated scientific hypotheses and experimental plans, introduces novel explanation modalities via inter-agent dialogue provenance, and leverages semantic embeddings with rule-based traversal to prioritize salient knowledge paths. This collective reasoning framework pushes beyond prior work by coupling architectural rigor, hybrid AI paradigms, and interactive provenance visualization, thereby addressing the trust gap in automated scientific discovery.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an integrated multi-agent AI framework composed of several specialized LLM agents: (1) a Graph-Traversal Agent that explores scientific knowledge graphs using semantic embeddings and rule-based path ranking algorithms to identify promising hypothesis nodes; (2) a Synthesis Planning Agent that generates stepwise experimental plans grounded on graph-traversal outputs; (3) a Property Prediction Agent that dynamically evaluates generated hypotheses via learned surrogate models; and (4) a Literature Mining Agent that supports validation and grounding by extracting relevant evidence from scientific publications. These agents communicate asynchronously through a structured agent communication protocol grounded on shared graph representations alongside natural language summaries. \n\nThe Graph-Traversal Agent tightly couples with the LLM generator via an attention-intervention mechanism that influences token generation probabilities based on active graph nodes and ranked paths, implemented through cross-attention bias modules. Algorithmically, each generation step conditions on both semantic embeddings from traversed graph nodes and inter-agent dialogue histories, enabling transparent reasoning traceability. Visualization dashboards capture and expose token-level provenance chains and inter-agent exchanges for user auditing and interactive refinement. \n\nPseudocode snippet outlines the token generation loop integrating graph traversal and inter-agent messaging, substantiating transparent reasoning trace generation. This hybrid AI approach synergistically balances generation fluency, creativity, and interpretability by combining rule-based traversal, semantic embedding guidance, and interactive multi-agent collaboration.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop individual LLM agents and implement the structured multi-agent communication protocol with the shared knowledge graph interface.\n2) Design and integrate the cross-attention bias modules enabling graph traversal influence on generation tokens and implement path ranking combining semantic embeddings and rule-based heuristics.\n3) Apply the integrated system to photocatalyst material discovery case studies with rich, curated scientific knowledge graphs.\n4) Construct interactive visualization dashboards capturing token-level provenance chains and inter-agent dialogue logs.\n5) Conduct controlled user studies with domain scientists evaluating interpretability, trustworthiness, collaborative hypothesis generation quality, and discovery efficiency compared to standalone graph-guided and black-box baselines.\n6) Analyze performance trade-offs and iterative improvements guided by feedback and real-world deployment simulations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Propose a stepwise experimental plan to synthesize novel photocatalysts with improved visible-light absorption.'\n\nOutput: A multi-agent generated plan detailing: (1) Graph-Traversal Agent's selected knowledge graph paths linking candidate materials and reaction mechanisms with semantic embedding scores; (2) Synthesis Planning Agent's enumerated experiments annotated with stepwise provenance and linked graph nodes; (3) Property Prediction Agent's evaluations of predicted photocatalytic performance; (4) Literature Mining Agent's relevant publication citations supporting reactions.\n\nThe entire reasoning trail—including token-level graph attention, inter-agent dialogue transcripts, and ranked path justifications—is interactively explorable via a user dashboard, enabling scientists to audit, question, and adapt the AI-generated discovery process.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should direct integration via cross-attention bias modules overly constrain generation creativity or degrade fluency, we will implement a hybrid mode toggling between explainable, graph-guided generation and a free-form generation mode, with fallback agents re-ranking candidate hypotheses.\n\nWe will also incorporate reinforcement learning with human-in-the-loop feedback to optimize path ranking and agent communication strategies, ensuring a balance between novelty and trustworthiness.\n\nIf multi-agent coordination introduces bottlenecks, we will modularize agents with asynchronous updates and employ distilled lightweight models for efficiency without sacrificing interpretability or collaborative benefits."

However, the exact mechanism of how the graph traversal influences or constrains the LLM's generation is not clearly specified. For instance, it is unclear whether the graph traversal guides token-level generation, post-processes outputs, or interacts with the model at attention layers. Clarify how the system ensures stepwise interpretability without sacrificing generation fluency or creativity, including architectural details or training strategies. Providing this clarity is critical for assessing soundness and implementation feasibility reliably, especially given the tightly coupled components involved in interpretability and knowledge grounding in LLMs.  Please elaborate on specific mechanisms, interfaces, and expected data flows between graph and language modules in the next version of the proposal, ideally with preliminary algorithmic sketches or pseudocode where possible to substantiate claims of transparent reasoning trace generation remedies the trust gap in scientific discovery planning.  This clarity will improve the soundness and reproducibility of the method's core assumptions and feasibility of the planned experiments to validate them effectively.  (Section: Proposed_Method)  "

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty rating as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the current focus on graph-guided LLMs for material design discovery, a concrete route to enhance impact and novelty is to integrate multi-agent system principles and hybrid AI models as indicated in the global concept list. For example, incorporate collaborative multi-agent protocols where multiple LLM agents with distinct expertise (e.g., synthesis planning, property prediction, literature mining) interact via structured communication grounded on the knowledge graph. This can enable richer hypothesis generation and dynamic validation loops, moving beyond standalone graph-traversal LLMs to a discovery engine empowered by agent communication and multi-modal inputs. Additionally, utilizing semantic embeddings and rule-based systems within the traversal strategy could improve path ranking and experimental plan saliency, addressing the fallback plan's aims systematically. Suggest embedding these global concepts in method design and experiment evaluation to widen impact, boost novelty, and better align with current trends in scalable scientific AI systems. This approach can also enhance interpretability by exposing inter-agent dialogue and decision provenance as novel explanation modalities beyond static graphs.
