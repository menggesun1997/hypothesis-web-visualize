    "Motivation": "Addresses the novel external gap by embedding vision-language model capabilities into dementia clinical digital twins, advancing multimodal, interpretable AI reasoning in neurodegenerative diagnostics.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a multimodal transformer architecture that ingests longitudinal video recordings of patient behavior and conversational transcripts, aligning visual actions with semantic language tokens through a shared embedding space. Integrate explainable reasoning modules highlighting behavioral-language correlations indicative of disease progression.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather longitudinal multimodal dementia patient data. 2) Pretrain unimodal vision and language encoders separately. 3) Fine-tune a joint multimodal transformer with cross-attention layers. 4) Test dementia progression prediction accuracy and interpretability via attention visualization.",

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that integrating visual behavior and language data through a multimodal transformer will substantially improve dementia progression prediction and interpretability. However, it lacks a discussion or evidence supporting the quality, consistency, and sufficient granularity of longitudinal video and transcript data necessary for robust alignment. Clarify assumptions about data availability, heterogeneity, and noise handling to strengthen soundness and transparency in the method's applicability to real-world clinical data scenarios, which are often noisy and irregularly sampled in neurodegenerative settings. Such an analysis is crucial to validate the feasibility of the core premise before extensive modeling is attempted or judged effective at prediction and explanation of disease progression trajectories. Consider integrating domain expert feedback or referencing existing evidence supporting these assumptions in the dementia clinical digital twin context. This will solidify foundational arguments for the modelâ€™s effectiveness and adoption potential in clinical workflows, ensuring the assumptions about patient multimodal data integration are valid and realistic within neurodegenerative diagnostics contexts ultimately targeted by the work, thereby elevating both soundness and impact significance given the clinical complexity involved in these tasks and datasets inherently impacted by neurodegeneration progression stages and patient variability.\nThis feedback targets the core assumptions articulated in the Problem Statement and Proposed Method sections."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step-by-Step Experiment Plan outlines a logical sequence from data acquisition through unimodal pretraining to final multimodal fine-tuning and interpretability evaluation. Nevertheless, it lacks critical explicit detail required to ensure scientific and practical feasibility, notably: (1) Clear description of the dataset scale, diversity, and annotation protocols, as variability in clinical videos and transcripts profoundly affects model generalization and interpretability. (2) Metrics and validation schemes tailored for longitudinal, clinical neurodegenerative progression prediction tasks should be specified beyond generic accuracy. For example, time-to-event analysis, correlation with clinical cognitive scales, or interpretable uncertainty quantification. (3) Strategies for mitigating common multimodal challenges such as modality asynchrony, missing data points, or transcript errors are not discussed. (4) Concrete plans for clinical evaluation or expert-in-the-loop validation to verify interpretability claims are absent. To bolster feasibility and translational potential, include detailed descriptions or preliminary results addressing these points in your experimental plan, ensuring that the pipeline is robust, clinically meaningful, and deployable. This feedback applies to the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section."
