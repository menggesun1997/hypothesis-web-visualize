    "title": "Hybrid Meta-Learned Cognitive Architectures Incorporating Affective and Biomedical Feedback Loops",
    "Problem_Statement": "Siloed research on architectural meta-learning and cognitive-affective models limits understanding of dynamic feedback mechanisms crucial for realistic mechanistic modeling.",
    "Motivation": "Fulfills the internal gap on absent bridging concepts by developing architectures embedding closed-loop feedback from affective and biomedical signal processing into meta-learned language model cognition.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create architectures combining meta-learning modules with affective state estimators and biomedical feedback predictors. Use contrastive learning to align internal representations with affective and physiological signals, enabling iterative cognitive adaptation mimicking human emotional-physiological learning cycles.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multi-modal datasets linking language, emotion, and biomedical signals.\n2) Develop feedback-augmented meta-learning models.\n3) Train with contrastive objectives enforcing alignment of feedback states.\n4) Assess mechanistic interpretability through probing feedback influence on learned cognition.\n5) Compare with feedforward meta-learning baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Language input paired with real-time heart rate variability signal.\nExpected Output: Model internally adjusts cognitive representations reflecting physiological states; mechanistic insights show effect of biomedical feedback on language understanding.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If joint modeling is unstable, decouple feedback loops and retrain separately or simplify affective/biomedical inputs to proxy measures (e.g., self-report)."
