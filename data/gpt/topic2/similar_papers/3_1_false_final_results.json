    "title": "Data-Architecture Tradeoff Analyzer via Large-Scale Meta-Learned Foundation Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is unresolved tension in existing meta-learning literature regarding the respective impacts of data volume and architectural complexity on cognitive fidelity and learning efficiency in deep language models.",
    "Motivation": "Directly targets the internal limitation around data versus architecture balance by integrating large-scale foundation models with meta-learning frameworks, exploring this relationship systematically for mechanistic understanding.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an experimental meta-learning framework that allows controlled modulation of data scale and architectural depth/width within foundation models. Employ contrastive learning to probe emergent cognition-related phenomena in the models as data-architecture tradeoffs vary. Introduce metrics quantifying mechanistic interpretability linked to architecture-data configurations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select a scalable foundation language model architecture (e.g., transformer-based).\n2) Create variants with different architectural complexities.\n3) Prepare multi-scale datasets, from low to massive sizes.\n4) Train models under combinations of data scale and architecture.\n5) Use contrastive probes targeted at cognitive mechanisms (e.g., compositional generalization).\n6) Analyze trends and tradeoffs in mechanistic emergence and learning efficiency.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: GPT-like model variants trained on subsets of common crawl corpus.\nExpected Output: Quantitative curves showing optimal architecture-data balance for cognitive-like generalization, with mechanistic signatures traced via contrastive analysis.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If controlled modulation proves unstable, implement simulated meta-learning environments or synthetic data generation allowing finer control, or adopt Bayesian optimization over hyperparameters to identify data-architecture sweet spots."
