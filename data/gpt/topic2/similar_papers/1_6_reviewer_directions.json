    "title": "Graph-Guided LLMs for Interpretable Automated Scientific Discovery Planning",
    "Problem_Statement": "Automated scientific discovery lacks interpretability when AI agents generate hypotheses or experimental plans, leading to low trust and usability among scientists.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to the gap in interpretability and grounding in experimental automation by explicitly integrating graph-guided generation with transparent reasoning traces to link question answering with materials discovery workflows.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a transformer-based LLM with a built-in graph traversal module that documents and visualizes how hypotheses are derived stepwise from knowledge graph nodes. The system generates experimental plans with linked provenance chains, enabling human experts to audit and interactively refine AI-driven discovery processes.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop prototype graph traversal routines linked to LLM generation steps. 2) Apply to material design case studies with rich knowledge graphs. 3) Implement visualization dashboards for user feedback. 4) Conduct user studies measuring interpretability, trust, and discovery efficiency compared with black-box baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Propose experiments to synthesize new photocatalysts.' Output: A plan enumerating each hypothesis step with knowledge graph node citations and suggested lab protocols, interactively explorable by scientists.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If interpretability reduces generation quality, enable hybrid modes switching between explainable and free-form generation. Augment graph traversal with learned path ranking to prioritize salient nodes."

          "feedback_content": "The 'Proposed_Method' outlines an ambitious integration of a transformer-based LLM with a graph traversal module that documents reasoning with provenance chains. However, the exact mechanism of how the graph traversal influences or constrains the LLM's generation is not clearly specified. For instance, it is unclear whether the graph traversal guides token-level generation, post-processes outputs, or interacts with the model at attention layers. Clarify how the system ensures stepwise interpretability without sacrificing generation fluency or creativity, including architectural details or training strategies. Providing this clarity is critical for assessing soundness and implementation feasibility reliably, especially given the tightly coupled components involved in interpretability and knowledge grounding in LLMs.  Please elaborate on specific mechanisms, interfaces, and expected data flows between graph and language modules in the next version of the proposal, ideally with preliminary algorithmic sketches or pseudocode where possible to substantiate claims of transparent reasoning trace generation remedies the trust gap in scientific discovery planning.  This clarity will improve the soundness and reproducibility of the method's core assumptions and feasibility of the planned experiments to validate them effectively.  (Section: Proposed_Method)  "

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty rating as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the current focus on graph-guided LLMs for material design discovery, a concrete route to enhance impact and novelty is to integrate multi-agent system principles and hybrid AI models as indicated in the global concept list. For example, incorporate collaborative multi-agent protocols where multiple LLM agents with distinct expertise (e.g., synthesis planning, property prediction, literature mining) interact via structured communication grounded on the knowledge graph. This can enable richer hypothesis generation and dynamic validation loops, moving beyond standalone graph-traversal LLMs to a discovery engine empowered by agent communication and multi-modal inputs. Additionally, utilizing semantic embeddings and rule-based systems within the traversal strategy could improve path ranking and experimental plan saliency, addressing the fallback plan's aims systematically. Suggest embedding these global concepts in method design and experiment evaluation to widen impact, boost novelty, and better align with current trends in scalable scientific AI systems. This approach can also enhance interpretability by exposing inter-agent dialogue and decision provenance as novel explanation modalities beyond static graphs.
