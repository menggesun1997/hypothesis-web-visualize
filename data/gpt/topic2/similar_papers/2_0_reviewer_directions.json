    "title": "CNN-Infused Regulatory-Compliant Multilingual LM",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing language models struggle to integrate multilingual scientific communication effectively while respecting complex biomedical regulatory requirements, especially given the small, noisy, and heterogeneous data scenario.",
    "Motivation": "This idea targets the critical internal gap of adapting sophisticated CNN techniques (residual blocks, continuous wavelet transform) into small-data-centric language model fine-tuning for interpretable, regulatory-aware multilingual language processing, as identified under the hidden bridge analysis between CNNs and approval processes.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid language model architecture where convolutional modules with residual blocks and continuous wavelet transform layers preprocess multilingual biomedical text embeddings to extract robust, regulatory-relevant features. This output feeds into a transformer-based language model fine-tuned on limited, multilingual biosimilar datasets with regularization reflecting regulatory compliance constraints (e.g., interpretability and auditability losses). The framework includes constraints mimicking regulatory validation checkpoints as training feedback.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multilingual biosimilar scientific corpora with regulatory annotations and limited size; 2) Implement CNN modules with residual blocks and continuous wavelet transform preprocessing; 3) Integrate with transformer-based LM fine-tuning; 4) Baselines: vanilla transformer LM fine-tuning, CNN-alone, and non-CWT language models; 5) Metrics: BLEU for communication fidelity, interpretability scores (feature relevance), regulatory compliance proxies, and robustness on noisy inputs; 6) Cross-validate across languages and biosimilar contexts.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Scientific abstract in Spanish describing a biosimilar clinical trial with regulatory terms. Expected output: Accurate, compliant English summary highlighting key regulatory elements with explainable model attention aligning to regulatory keywords.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If the CNN modules fail to enhance performance, fallback to ablation removing continuous wavelet transform layers, or replace CNN modules with graph convolutional networks representing regulatory knowledge graphs. Employ data augmentation via GANs to compensate for small data."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed method innovatively combines CNN modules with residual blocks and continuous wavelet transform preprocessing before a transformer-based LM fine-tuning, the mechanism by which these CNN-extracted features enhance or integrate with the transformer embeddings lacks clarity. Specifically, the proposal should elaborate on how the wavelet-transformed convolutional features are aligned temporally and semantically with the transformer inputs, how these are fused or concatenated, and how this architectural hybridization concretely improves interpretability and regulatory compliance. Clarifying this pipeline and its theoretical justification will strengthen the soundness of the approach and facilitate reproducibility for reviewers and future researchers regardless of domain-specific expertise in wavelets or regulatory modeling. Consider including schematic diagrams or modular data flow descriptions and preliminary results or pilot experiments to concretely demonstrate these mechanisms in the next revision of Proposed_Method sections."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan covers data collection, model implementation, and evaluation comprehensively; however, the feasibility of acquiring sufficiently annotated multilingual biosimilar corpora with explicit regulatory annotations and adequate size remains uncertain and understated. The plan should address realistic sourcing strategies, potential licensing or privacy challenges, and the expected scale of these data. Additionally, the integration of interpretability and regulatory compliance metrics is ambitious but lacks specification on how these metrics will be quantitatively measured, benchmarked, or validated, given the small and noisy dataset context. The fallback plan involves graph convolutional networks and GAN-based augmentation but needs clearer criteria for triggering these strategies and how this will affect evaluation consistency. Including contingency plans for data scarcity, annotation quality, and metric reliability will improve the experiment plan's practicality and robustness."
