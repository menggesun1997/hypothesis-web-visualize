    "title": "Multilingual Regulatory Knowledge Graph Embedding for LM Fine-Tuning",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing multilingual scientific LMs do not efficiently embed complex regulatory knowledge, limiting their compliance and localization capabilities for biosimilar domains across international contexts.",
    "Motivation": "This idea expands on the high-potential opportunity to integrate regulatory graph structures with ML, filling the gap of insufficient exploration of regulatory compliance integration within language model pipelines in multilingual contexts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct multilingual regulatory knowledge graphs representing approval criteria, terminologies, and regional differences. Develop novel embedding methods that encode these graphs into continuous vectors feeding into LM fine-tuning, creating models that inherently understand regulatory constraints and localization nuances for better scientific communication.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build regulatory knowledge graphs from biosimilar approval documents in multiple languages; 2) Develop embedding techniques combining graph convolution and transformer token embeddings; 3) Fine-tune language models incorporating these embeddings; 4) Evaluate with multilingual scientific communication tasks measuring regulatory compliance accuracy, translation fidelity, and interpretability; 5) Baselines without knowledge graph embeddings.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Regulatory document snippet in German and corresponding knowledge graph substructure. Output: Enhanced LM summary in English preserving regulatory nuances validated against graph-encoded constraints.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If knowledge graph embeddings do not improve compliance, fallback to rule-based annotations or knowledge distillation from graph neural networks to the language model. Alternatively, augment training with synthetic regulatory examples."

          "feedback_content": "While the idea to integrate multilingual regulatory knowledge graphs into LM fine-tuning is promising, the Proposed_Method lacks sufficient clarity on how the novel embedding techniques will effectively fuse graph convolution embeddings with transformer token embeddings. More detailed explanation is needed on architectural design, the alignment between graph-based and token-based representations, and how the system will jointly optimize these components to ensure regulatory constraints are faithfully encoded and utilized by the LM during fine-tuning. Without this, the mechanism risks being under-specified and may impair reproducibility and evaluation rigor. Consider providing diagrams or pseudocode to clarify these interactions and optimization strategies within the model pipeline, highlighting how the embeddings explicitly enforce or enhance regulatory knowledge integration in multilingual contexts, which is crucial for soundness of the approach and its eventual success in compliance-heavy domains like biosimilars locally and internationally. This enhancement will strengthen reviewer confidence in the technical novelty and soundness of the core contribution beyond established graph-embedding and LM fusion techniques in related literature. Targeting this gap first will also inform feasibility and evaluation strategies consistently downstream in the pipeline setup and metrics design phases of the project, reducing the risk of conceptual obstacles escalating to experimental failures or misinterpretations later on. Addressing this will improve the theoretical and practical rigor substantially, clarifying how the method distinguishes itself in a competitive area with overlapping approaches already published or in progress globally.

          "feedback_content": "The Experiment_Plan outlines a logical progression from graph construction through LM fine-tuning and evaluation. However, it currently underestimates the substantial resource demands and practical challenges involved in building comprehensive, multilingual regulatory knowledge graphs specifically for biosimilar approval documents, which are often confidential, heterogeneous, and vary considerably across jurisdictions. The plan should explicitly include data acquisition strategies, legal and ethical considerations, and curation protocols to ensure high-quality, consistent graph structures. Furthermore, the integration and joint training of graph convolutional embeddings with transformer models present non-trivial computational and convergence challenges. The plan should anticipate and specify modular validation steps for each major component (e.g., separate benchmarking of graph embedding quality, compatibility checks with token embeddings before LM fine-tuning), fallback experiments with rule-based annotations should be more explicitly leveraged as controlled ablation studies rather than mere backup. Finally, to realistically manage project scope and validate methodology incrementally, consider starting with fewer languages or a limited regulatory subset before scaling. Expanding the experiment plan to fully acknowledge these challenges and incorporate mitigation strategies will enhance feasibility and increase the likelihood of meaningful, generalizable outcomes.
