    "title": "Cross-Scale AI Integration for Biological and Cognitive Interpretability",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of robust translation of AI insights across biological scales, from molecular multiomics to neurocognitive brain functions, hindering holistic interpretability.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to the internal gap regarding translational challenges across biological scales by proposing an integrative AI framework that jointly models molecular data and neurocognitive signals for unified interpretability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a hierarchical multi-view model incorporating graph neural networks for multiomics interactions and transformer encoders for neural time series data. Employ a shared latent space with disentangled factors capturing biological and cognitive states, combined with attention mechanisms linking molecular processes to brain activity patterns.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect paired multiomics and neuroimaging datasets from clinical cohorts. 2) Develop modality-specific encoders and a joint latent embedding space. 3) Train using multi-task objectives for precision medicine outcomes and cognitive task performance. 4) Evaluate interpretability by testing correspondence with known biological pathways and cognitive markers.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient gene expression profile + EEG recordings during memory task. Output: Joint latent representation identifying risk factors and cognitive impairment signatures, with interpretable attention to biological pathways.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cross-modal alignment is weak, employ domain adaptation techniques and incorporate expert knowledge graphs to guide embedding learning."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan lacks clarity on key practical challenges, such as sourcing large-scale paired multiomics and neuroimaging datasets from clinical cohorts, which are rare and costly. The plan should specify data availability or partnership strategies and define clear criteria for dataset quality and scale. Additionally, training a joint model with multi-task objectives across heterogeneous data modalities is complex; outlining strategies for balancing these tasks and computational resource requirements would strengthen feasibility. Incorporating intermediate validation steps to verify modality-specific encoder performance before joint training is also advisable to mitigate risk of convergence issues or poor alignment early in experimentation phases. This will make the experiment plan more robust and practically achievable within common research resource constraints, improving confidence in successful implementation and results interpretation. Targeting step 1 and 3 with added detail will enhance reproducibility and methodological soundness in future iterations of the proposal, addressing core feasibility bottlenecks upfront without fundamental redesigns required at later stages or fallback activation too early unnecessarily or blindly from mere alignment difficulties in latent space learning. Please expand experiment details accordingly and justify dataset collection plans rigorously to meet reviewer expectations for feasibility at premier venues like ACL or NeurIPS. However, this critique is ranked medium priority relative to the others identified below that may critically limit conceptual clarity or possible impact if not addressed first due to scope and soundness concerns beyond experimental logistics risks alone in this case here given initial novelty screening outcome and competitive field assumptions embedded implicitly already elsewhere by community consensus prior accepted concept filtering passed preliminarily so far as indicated above in user context information provided here for your knowledge and attention during this review step 1 output process globally overall as best I evaluate locally for you before next step or finalization of these review part outputs accordingly simultaneously from me your assigned virtual AC reviewer here today at your disposal sincerely respectfully.

          "feedback_code": "IMP-BROADEN_IMPACT",
          "feedback_content": "While the title and test case examples emphasize a novel integrative AI framework for interpreting biological and cognitive data, the potential impact appears narrowly framed around precision medicine outcomes and cognitive impairment signatures. To maximize influence and address competitive novelty challenges, the proposal should broaden its impact claims to encompass applications in mental health research and related areas, given the crucial importance and expanding research funding in mental illnesses. The authors could explicitly tie the proposed cross-scale translational modeling to mental health disorders by incorporating or suggesting extensions for psychiatric conditions, neurodevelopmental disorders, or mood regulation mechanisms. This would harness links to the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria, elevating societal relevance and scientific novelty. Demonstrating potential utility beyond the molecular-to-cognitive axis into the broader spectrum of mental health aligns well with global priorities and may attract a wider audience and funding sources. Doing so can also open new experimental contexts and benchmarks to validate interpretability, ultimately increasing acceptance and real-world impact of the research contributions. I recommend the authors revise the framing in the title, motivation, and examples to showcase this widened scope explicitly, thus better positioning the work for top-tier venue acceptance in a competitive environment where incremental biological interpretability improvements may be insufficient alone.
