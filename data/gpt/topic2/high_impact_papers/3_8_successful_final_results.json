        "title": "Contrastive Ethnography-Guided Framework for Language Model Social-Cognitive Alignment with Scalable Annotation Strategies",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current language models lack mechanistic alignment with rich, detailed social-cognitive ethnographic insights due to the scarcity, complexity, and limited scale of annotated datasets capturing such phenomena. This scarcity challenges the realistic application of contrastive learning methods aimed at aligning model embeddings with social-cognitive dimensions derived from ethnography. Addressing the assumptions regarding data availability, annotation consistency, and representativeness is crucial to sustainably validate and advance social-cognitive alignment in language models.",
        "Motivation": "While leveraging ethnographically annotated social-cognitive phenomena to enhance interpretability has been proposed, existing attempts face limitations due to scarce, inconsistent datasets and insufficient grounding in cognitive processes underlying language use. Our approach differentiates itself by explicitly addressing these data challenges through a scalable, hybrid annotation methodology inspired by models of language learning and cognitive linguistic structure, thus pushing beyond prior work that treats ethnographic insights as static resources. This integration promises superior mechanistic interpretability and richer language identity modeling, setting a new standard in socially grounded language AI.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel contrastive learning architecture trained on a hybrid ethnographic dataset comprising (1) curated expert-annotated conversational corpora enriched with social roles and interactional strategies, and (2) crowdsourced proxy annotations guided by active learning to ensure scalability and annotation consistency. By embedding cognitive processes—modeled after biologically plausible language learning mechanisms—and linguistic structure theories into the contrastive loss function, the model aligns embeddings along fine-grained social-cognitive semantic dimensions. Our method incorporates annotation confidence scores to weight pairwise similarities, mitigating variability and enhancing robustness. This mechanistic alignment extends interpretability by simulating severe language disorder effects through perturbation analyses within the embedding space, providing insights into cognitive-social dysfunction models.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate an initial ethnographic conversational dataset with expert annotations on social roles, interactional strategies, and relevant cognitive social labels.\n2) Design and deploy an active learning-powered crowdsourcing framework to collect proxy annotations, iteratively refining label accuracy and coverage while managing annotation agreement through integration of reliability metrics.\n3) Formulate a contrastive loss that incorporates annotation confidence weights and cognitive-linguistic structural constraints, reflecting interactional nuances and modeled cognitive processes.\n4) Train the language model embedding space with this loss, including experiments simulating embedding perturbations to model severe language disorder effects.\n5) Evaluate embeddings with a multi-faceted strategy encompassing quantitative metrics (embedding separability indices, contrastive loss convergence, agreement with annotation confidence), benchmarking against baselines lacking cognitive or ethnographic guidance, and qualitative assessment by ethnographic and cognitive science experts.\n6) Validate replicability by releasing annotation protocols and providing open-source training and evaluation pipelines.\n7) Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of each annotation source and cognitive-linguistic constraint to demonstrate methodological contribution and robustness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multi-turn dialogues annotated with social roles (e.g., authority, peer), interactional strategies (e.g., politeness, persuasion), and proxy cognitive features from crowdsourcing.\nExpected Output: Model embeddings form distinct, interpretable clusters aligned with social-cognitive categories, yield embedding shifts aligned with cognitive-linguistic theory constraints, and display predictable degradation patterns mirroring severe language disorder simulations.\nBaseline comparison models lacking proxy annotations or cognitive constraints show inferior clustering and less interpretable mechanisms.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "In case expert ethnographic labels remain insufficient or proxy annotation reliability is low, we will incorporate existing large-scale linguistically structured corpora annotated with social metadata as proxies (e.g., conversation logs with social context), and integrate simulated cognitive process signals derived from computational models of language learning. Additionally, unsupervised contrastive methods leveraging linguistic structure and social role proxies will be explored to approximate alignment, ensuring continued progress despite annotation challenges."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes the availability and sufficiency of ethnographically annotated datasets capturing detailed social-cognitive phenomena for training language models. However, such datasets are scarce, often limited in size, and complex to annotate reliably, which may undermine the foundational premise of mechanistic alignment via contrastive learning. It is crucial to explicitly address the assumptions about data availability, annotation consistency, and representativeness, and to clarify how these challenges will be mitigated to validate the core hypothesis of social-cognitive alignment through contrastive methods in language models. Clarifying these assumptions upfront will strengthen the conceptual foundation and guide realistic expectations regarding model performance and interpretability gains derived from ethnographic insights, making the claim more sound and credible at a mechanistic level. This critique targets the 'Problem_Statement' and 'Proposed_Method' sections to ensure the premise and methodology are tightly integrated and well-substantiated for soundness evaluation purposes."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The experiment plan outlines curation, implementation of contrastive losses with ethnographic pairwise relationships, and embedding evaluation via human expert validation. While conceptually coherent, it lacks critical operational details on how ethnographic annotations will be consistently and scalably sourced or augmented, especially given the known sparsity in such data. Furthermore, the plan does not specify benchmarking baselines, quantitative metrics beyond embedding separability, or steps ensuring replicability and robustness in results. Given the novelty and complexity, feasibility depends heavily on pragmatic annotation schemes, validation protocols, and integration with existing datasets or proxies. The plan should incorporate concrete strategies for data acquisition (including fallback annotation methods), detail of contrastive loss formulation reflecting social-cognitive dimensions, and a multi-faceted evaluation strategy combining quantitative and qualitative metrics. This will enhance the rigor and credibility of the experimental approach, providing clear pathways to execution and measurable success criteria. This feedback is focused on refining the 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' for feasibility enhancement."
