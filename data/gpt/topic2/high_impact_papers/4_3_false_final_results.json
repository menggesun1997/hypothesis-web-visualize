    "title": "Cognitive-Social Bridge Embedding for Language Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Language models exhibit compartmentalized knowledge representations that fail to bridge socio-cultural theories from social sciences with computational concept models, limiting authenticity in simulating human concept formation.",
    "Motivation": "This idea consciously addresses the internal compartmentalization gap by constructing neural embeddings explicitly bridging social science conceptual spaces and computational semantic spaces, enabling richer and more nuanced conceptualization.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop dual embedding spaces: one trained on social science literature (core social science texts, qualitative data) and another on technical corpora, then construct a cross-space alignment mechanism using graph-based relational learning that models hidden bridges between these domains dynamically within language models.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble parallel corpora from social sciences and technical domains. 2) Train independent embeddings and build cross-domain knowledge graphs. 3) Implement graph neural network-based alignment modules. 4) Embed into language model pre-training phases and evaluate performance on cross-domain concept disambiguation tasks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Explain the impact of digital transformation on labor ideologies.\" Expected output: A response that coherently integrates socio-cultural conceptualizations with technical digital transformation models, clearly reflecting cross-domain understanding.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If graph alignment underperforms, fallback to multi-task learning approaches with shared latent spaces and domain-adaptive fine-tuning."
