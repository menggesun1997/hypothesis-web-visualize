This conclusion is largely based on three sets of findings: (1) DNNs are more accurate than any other model in classifying images taken from various datasets, (2) DNNs do the best job in predicting the pattern of human errors in classifying objects taken from various behavioral datasets, and (3) DNNs do the best job in predicting brain signals in response to images taken from various brain datasets (e.g., single cell responses or fMRI data). However, these behavioral and brain datasets do not test hypotheses regarding what features are contributing to good predictions and we show that the predictions may be mediated by DNNs that share little overlap with biological vision. More problematically, we show that DNNs account for almost no results from psychological research. This contradicts the common claim that DNNs are good, let alone the best, models of human object recognition. We argue that theorists interested in developing biologically plausible models of human vision need to direct their attention to explaining psychological findings. More generally, theorists need to build models that explain the results of experiments that manipulate independent variables designed to test hypotheses rather than compete on making the best predictions. We conclude by briefly summarizing various promising modeling approaches that focus on psychological data.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Personality Traits in Large Language Models', 'abstract': '<p>The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling the generation of coherent and contextually relevant text. As LLMs increasingly power conversational agents, the synthetic personality embedded in these models, by virtue of training on large amounts of human data, is becoming increasingly important. Since personality is a key factor determining the effectiveness of communication, we present a comprehensive method for administering and validating personality tests on widely-used LLMs, as well as for shaping personality in the generated text of such LLMs. Applying this method, we found: 1) personality measurements in the outputs of some LLMs under specific prompting configurations are reliable and valid; 2) evidence of reliability and validity of synthetic LLM personality is stronger for larger and instruction fine-tuned models; and 3) personality in LLM outputs can be shaped along desired dimensions to mimic specific personality profiles. We discuss application and ethical implications of the measurement and shaping method, in particular regarding responsible use of LLMs.</p>'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Foundation Models for Natural Language Processing, Pre-trained Language Models Integrating Media', 'abstract': 'This open access book provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in research and applications of Foundation Models and is intended for readers familiar with basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts. Over the recent years, a revolutionary new paradigm has been developed for training models for NLP. These models are first pre-trained on large collections of text documents to acquire general syntactic knowledge and semantic information. Then, they are fine-tuned for specific tasks, which they can often solve with superhuman accuracy. When the models are large enough, they can be instructed by prompts to solve new tasks without any fine-tuning. Moreover, they can be applied to a wide range of different media and problem domains, ranging from image and video processing to robot control learning. Because they provide a blueprint for solving many tasks in artificial intelligence, they have been called Foundation Models. After a brief introduction tobasic NLP models the main pre-trained language models BERT, GPT and sequence-to-sequence transformer are described, as well as the concepts of self-attention and context-sensitive embedding. Then, different approaches to improving these models are discussed, such as expanding the pre-training criteria, increasing the length of input texts, or including extra knowledge. An overview of the best-performing models for about twenty application areas is then presented, e.g., question answering, translation, story generation, dialog systems, generating images from text, etc. For each application area, the strengths and weaknesses of current models are discussed, and an outlook on further developments is given.

The fabric of the EU linguistic landscape comprises 24 official languages and over 60 regional and minority languages. However, language barriers still hamper communication and the free flow of information. Multilingualism is a key cultural cornerstone of Europe, signifying what it means to be and to feel European. Various studies and resolutions have found a striking imbalance in the support of Europe’s languages through technologies, issuing a call to action. Following an introduction, the book is divided into two parts. The first part describes the state of the art of language technology and language-centric AI and the definition and metrics developed to measure digital language equality. It also presents the status quo in 2022/2023, i.e., the current level of technology support for over 30 European languages. The second part describes plans and recommendations on how to bring about digital language equality in Europe by 2030. It includes chapters on the setup and results of the community consultation process, four technical deep dives, an overview of existing strategic documents and an abridged version of the strategic agenda and roadmap. The recommendations have been prepared jointly with the European community in the fields of language technology, natural language processing, and language-centric AI, as well as with representatives of relevant initiatives and associations, language communities and regional and minority language groups. Ensuring appropriate technology support for all European languages will not only create jobs, growth and opportunities in the digital single market.

    "title": "Landscape Map for Benchmarking Scientific Language Models for Advancing Deep Learning Theory",
    "current_research_landscape": "The research cluster centers on analyzing and benchmarking scientific language models through the lenses of social network analysis and personality trait modeling. The core problem is understanding how machine learning techniques—specifically those analyzing social networks and personality measures—can be applied or improved for scientific language models. The two primary thematic islands are: (1) social network analysis and its applications in social networks employing machine learning methods, and (2) characterization and validation of personality traits and profiles in large language models. Dominant methods include semantic network analysis, personality testing (mapping synthetic personalities in LLM outputs), and employing foundational NLP pre-trained models like BERT and GPT. The foundational literature places emphasis on integrating interdisciplinary approaches including social sciences and psychology, while grounding the AI techniques in robust, validated analytical methods.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite advances, there is a lack of bridging concepts connecting personality measurement in LLMs to social network analytical methods, as indicated by the absence of bridge nodes. Also, papers express limitations in the psychological validity of neural network models (notably in human vision modeling), indicating a gap in models explaining not just predictive accuracy but underlying causal or psychological mechanisms. Furthermore, there is no explicit integration of digital multilingual or equity considerations for language diversity in benchmarking scientific language models. External/Novel Gaps: The GPS analysis reveals a 'hidden bridge' between 'social network analysis' and 'personality measures' through psychological concepts such as maladaptive traits, perceived social support, and personality disorders from psychology domains. These cross-disciplinary concepts are not yet integrated into this cluster. Leveraging psychological personality trait models (including frameworks like DSM-5 related constructs) could enrich the characterization and benchmarking of LLMs' synthetic personalities and social interaction modeling, improving model interpretability and robustness. Additionally, integrating these with social network contextual data may create more nuanced benchmarks that reflect human-like communication and cognition patterns rather than pure predictive metrics.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate psychological frameworks related to personality disorders and social support mechanisms (derived from the hidden bridge in psychology) with personality testing methodologies in LLM evaluation (B2 - personality traits cluster) to improve the psychological validity and explanatory power of synthetic personality metrics, addressing the limitation in existing models that lack grounding in psychological causality (Part A2). \n\nOpportunity 2: Combine social network analysis methods (B2 - social networks cluster) with personality profile assessment of LLMs to create enriched benchmarks that account for social context and personality-driven communication dynamics, leveraging insights from social and personality psychology to capture complex interaction patterns in scientific language models.\n\nOpportunity 3: Extend benchmarking frameworks to include multilingual and digital language equity considerations (suggested by technological and linguistic diversity gaps in Part A7 and Part A10) by applying semantic network analysis tools to cross-linguistic social networks and personality expression in multiple languages. This would address limitations in current models’ applicability across diverse languages and cultures, promoting inclusivity and robustness in scientific LLM evaluation."
