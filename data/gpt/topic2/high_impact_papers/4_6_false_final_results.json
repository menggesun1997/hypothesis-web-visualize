    "title": "Qualitative Comparative Embeddings for Cultural Concept Modeling",
    "Problem_Statement": "Capturing cultural nuances in language models is impaired by lack of fusion between qualitative comparative analyses from social sciences and neural embedding representations.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal silo of social science theory and computational models by embedding qualitative comparative codes directly into language model representations to improve cultural concept formation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Extend embedding layers to incorporate conditionally parameterized vectors representing qualitative comparative analysis outcomes, using conditional variational autoencoders to model concept variability across cultural contexts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect corpora from multiple cultures annotated with qualitative codes. 2) Train CVAEs conditioned on qualitative attributes alongside language modeling. 3) Evaluate cross-cultural concept modeling fidelity and transferability against standard embeddings.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Describe leadership styles in East Asian vs Western organizations.\" Expected output: Context-sensitive descriptions reflecting culturally grounded conceptual differences and subtleties.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "Fallback to fine-tuning language models on culturally labeled corpora or incorporating explicit cultural context tokens."
