    "abstract": "The Encyclopedia of Social Network Analysis and Mining (ESNAM) is the first major reference work to integrate fundamental concepts and research directions in the areas of social networks and applications to data mining. The second edition of ESNAM is a truly outstanding reference appealing to researchers, practitioners, instructors and students (both undergraduate and graduate), as well as the general public. This updated reference integrates all basics concepts and research efforts under one umbrella. Coverage has been expanded to include new emerging topics such as crowdsourcing, opinion mining, and sentiment analysis. Revised content of existing material keeps the encyclopedia current. The second edition is intended for college students as well as public and academic libraries. It is anticipated to continue to stimulate more awareness of social network applications and research efforts. The advent of electronic communication, and in particular on-line communities, have created social networks of hitherto unimaginable sizes. Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of this unique field, the essential contributions of diverse disciplines, from computer science, mathematics, and statistics to sociology and behavioral science, are described among the 300 authoritative yet highly readable entries. Students will find a world of information and insight behind the familiar fa√ßade of the social networks in which they participate. Researchers and practitioners will benefit from a comprehensive perspective on the methodologies for analysis of constructed networks, and the data mining and machine learning techniques that have proved attractive for sophisticated knowledge discovery in complex applications. Also addressed is the application of social network methodologies to other domains, such as web networks and biological networks.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have had extraordinary successes in classifying photographic images of objects and are often described as the best models of biological vision. This conclusion is largely based on three sets of findings: (1) DNNs are more accurate than any other model in classifying images taken from various datasets, (2) DNNs do the best job in predicting the pattern of human errors in classifying objects taken from various behavioral datasets, and (3) DNNs do the best job in predicting brain signals in response to images taken from various brain datasets (e.g., single cell responses or fMRI data). However, these behavioral and brain datasets do not test hypotheses regarding what features are contributing to good predictions and we show that the predictions may be mediated by DNNs that share little overlap with biological vision. More problematically, we show that DNNs account for almost no results from psychological research. This contradicts the common claim that DNNs are good, let alone the best, models of human object recognition. We argue that theorists interested in developing biologically plausible models of human vision need to direct their attention to explaining psychological findings. More generally, theorists need to build models that explain the results of experiments that manipulate independent variables designed to test hypotheses rather than compete on making the best predictions. We conclude by briefly summarizing various promising modeling approaches that focus on psychological data.",

    "abstract": "<p>The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling the generation of coherent and contextually relevant text. As LLMs increasingly power conversational agents, the synthetic personality embedded in these models, by virtue of training on large amounts of human data, is becoming increasingly important. Since personality is a key factor determining the effectiveness of communication, we present a comprehensive method for administering and validating personality tests on widely-used LLMs, as well as for shaping personality in the generated text of such LLMs. Applying this method, we found: 1) personality measurements in the outputs of some LLMs under specific prompting configurations are reliable and valid; 2) evidence of reliability and validity of synthetic LLM personality is stronger for larger and instruction fine-tuned models; and 3) personality in LLM outputs can be shaped along desired dimensions to mimic specific personality profiles. We discuss application and ethical implications of the measurement and shaping method, in particular regarding responsible use of LLMs.</p>",

    "year": 2023,
    "citationCount": 51,
    "fieldCitationRatio": 29.78,
    "abstract": "This open access book provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in research and applications of Foundation Models and is intended for readers familiar with basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts. Over the recent years, a revolutionary new paradigm has been developed for training models for NLP. These models are first pre-trained on large collections of text documents to acquire general syntactic knowledge and semantic information. Then, they are fine-tuned for specific tasks, which they can often solve with superhuman accuracy. When the models are large enough, they can be instructed by prompts to solve new tasks without any fine-tuning. Moreover, they can be applied to a wide range of different media and problem domains, ranging from image and video processing to robot control learning. Because they provide a blueprint for solving many tasks in artificial intelligence, they have been called Foundation Models. After a brief introduction tobasic NLP models the main pre-trained language models BERT, GPT and sequence-to-sequence transformer are described, as well as the concepts of self-attention and context-sensitive embedding. Then, different approaches to improving these models are discussed, such as expanding the pre-training criteria, increasing the length of input texts, or including extra knowledge. An overview of the best-performing models for about twenty application areas is then presented, e.g., question answering, translation, story generation, dialog systems, generating images from text, etc. For each application area, the strengths and weaknesses of current models are discussed, and an outlook on further developments is given. In addition, links are provided to freely available program code. A concluding chapter summarizes the economic opportunities, mitigation of risks, and potential developments of AI.",

    "abstract": "This book will show how generative technology works and the drivers. It will also look at the applications ‚Äì showing what various startups and large companies are doing in the space. There will also be a look at the challenges and risk factors. During the past decade, companies have spent billions on AI. But the focus has been on applying the technology to predictions ‚Äì which is known as analytical AI. It can mean that you receive TikTok videos that you cannot resist. Or analytical AI can fend against spam or fraud or forecast when a package will be delivered. While such things are beneficial, there is much more to AI. The next megatrend will be leveraging the technology to be creative. For example, you could take a book and an AI model will turn it into a movie ‚Äì at very little cost. This is all part of generative AI. It‚Äôs still in the nascent stages but it is progressing quickly. Generative AI can already create engaging blog posts, social media messages, beautiful artwork and compelling videos. The potential for this technology is enormous. It will be useful for many categories like sales, marketing, legal, product design, code generation, and even pharmaceutical creation. What You Will Learn The importance of understanding generative AI The fundamentals of the technology, like the foundation and diffusion models How generative AI apps work How generative AI will impact various categories like the law, marketing/sales, gaming, product development, and code generation. The risks, downsides and challenges. Who This Book is For Professionals that do not have a technical background. Rather, the audience will be mostly those in Corporate America (such as managers) as well as people in tech startups, who will need an understanding of generative AI to evaluate the solutions.",

    "abstract": "Semantic Network Analysis in Social Sciences introduces the fundamentals of semantic network analysis and its applications in the social sciences. Readers learn how to easily transform any given text into a visual network of words co-occurring together, a process that allows mapping the main themes appearing in the text and revealing its main narratives and biases. Semantic network analysis is particularly useful today with the increasing volumes of text-based information available. It is one of the developing, cutting-edge methods to organize, identify patterns and structures, and understand the meanings of our information society. The first chapters in this book offer step-by-step guidelines for conducting semantic network analysis, including choosing and preparing the text, selecting desired words, constructing the networks, and interpreting their meanings. Free software tools and code are also presented. The rest of the book displays state-of-the-art studies from around the world that apply this method to explore news, political speeches, social media content, and even to organize interview transcripts and literature reviews. Aimed at scholars with no previous knowledge in the field, this book can be used as a main or a supplementary textbook for general courses on research methods or network analysis courses, as well as a starting point to conduct your own content analysis of large texts.",

    "title": "European Language Equality, A Strategic Agenda for Digital Language Equality",
    "year": 2023,
    "citationCount": 10,
    "fieldCitationRatio": 19.94,
    "abstract": "This open access book presents a comprehensive collection of the European Language Equality (ELE) project‚Äôs results, its strategic agenda and roadmap with key recommendations to the European Union on how to achieve digital language equality in Europe by 2030. The fabric of the EU linguistic landscape comprises 24 official languages and over 60 regional and minority languages. However, language barriers still hamper communication and the free flow of information. Multilingualism is a key cultural cornerstone of Europe, signifying what it means to be and to feel European. Various studies and resolutions have found a striking imbalance in the support of Europe‚Äôs languages through technologies, issuing a call to action. Following an introduction, the book is divided into two parts. The first part describes the state of the art of language technology and language-centric AI and the definition and metrics developed to measure digital language equality. It also presents the status quo in 2022/2023, i.e., the current level of technology support for over 30 European languages. The second part describes plans and recommendations on how to bring about digital language equality in Europe by 2030. It includes chapters on the setup and results of the community consultation process, four technical deep dives, an overview of existing strategic documents and an abridged version of the strategic agenda and roadmap. The recommendations have been prepared jointly with the European community in the fields of language technology, natural language processing, and language-centric AI, as well as with representatives of relevant initiatives and associations, language communities and regional and minority language groups. Ensuring appropriate technology support for all European languages will not only create jobs, growth and opportunities in the digital single market. Overcoming language barriers in the digital environment is also essential for an inclusive society and for providing unity in diversity for many years to come.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in materials design is revolutionizing the field of materials engineering thanks to their power to predict material properties, design de novo materials with enhanced features, and discover new mechanisms beyond intuition. In addition, they can be used to infer complex design principles and identify high-quality candidates more rapidly than trial-and-error experimentation. From this perspective, herein we describe how these tools can enable the acceleration and enrichment of each stage of the discovery cycle of novel materials with optimized properties. We begin by outlining the state-of-the-art AI models in materials design, including machine learning (ML), deep learning, and materials informatics tools. These methodologies enable the extraction of meaningful information from vast amounts of data, enabling researchers to uncover complex correlations and patterns within material properties, structures, and compositions. Next, a comprehensive overview of AI-driven materials design is provided and its potential future prospects are highlighted. By leveraging such AI algorithms, researchers can efficiently search and analyze databases containing a wide range of material properties, enabling the identification of promising candidates for specific applications. This capability has profound implications across various industries, from drug development to energy storage, where materials performance is crucial. Ultimately, AI-based approaches are poised to revolutionize our understanding and design of materials, ushering in a new era of accelerated innovation and advancement.",

    "abstract": "Multilingual Digital Humanities explores the impact of monolingualism‚Äîespecially Anglocentrism‚Äîon digital practices in the humanities and social sciences. The volume explores a wide range of applied contexts, such as digital linguistic injustice, critical digital literacy, digital learning, digital publishing, low-resourced, minoritised or endangered languages in a digital space, and multilingual historical intertextuality. These discussions are situated within wider work on language technologies, language documentation, and international (in particular European) language-based infrastructure creation. Drawing on both primary and secondary research, this four-part book features 13 diverse case studies of infrastructural projects, pedagogical resources, computational models, interface building, and publishing initiatives in a range of languages, including Arabic, French, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, German, Spanish, Bengali, Hindi, Malayalam, and Tamil. All the debates are contextualised within a wider cultural frame, thus bridging the gap between the linguistic focus of the multilingual initiatives and wider discussion of cultural criticism in DH. Multilingual Digital Humanities recognises the digital as a culturally situated and organic multilingual entity embedding past, present, and future worlds, which reacts to and impacts on institutional and methodological frameworks for knowledge creation. It is essential reading for students, scholars, and practitioners working in digital humanities and digital studies.",
