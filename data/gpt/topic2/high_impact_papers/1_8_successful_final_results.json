        "title": "Clinically-Informed Multi-Agent Social-Personality Interaction Dataset for Scientific LLM Benchmarking",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing datasets inadequately represent realistic multi-agent social interactions influenced by detailed personality profiles and therapeutic dynamics, limiting the scientific benchmarking of LLMs on socially and clinically meaningful tasks integrating personality and social network evolution.",
        "Motivation": "This proposal addresses a critical gap by integrating clinically validated counseling psychology frameworks with computational social network dynamics and DSM-5 personality traits to generate a novel, richly annotated dataset. By bridging AI language modeling, personality psychology, social network evolution, and counseling services concepts, it advances beyond prior synthetic dialogue corpora. The proposed dataset enables rigorous benchmarking of LLMs on multi-dimensional social-personality tasks with high ecological validity, promoting advancements in socially aware and clinically relevant AI applications.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a computational framework that synthesizes multi-agent dialogues by embedding validated DSM-5 personality profiles and social network roles within a dynamic, agent-based simulation governed by algorithms adapted from counseling psychology and network biology. Each agent's dialogue generation is controlled by a modular pipeline: (1) Personality-driven behavioral propensity vectors derived from DSM-5 traits influence linguistic style and response choice via specialized prompt templates. (2) Social network roles and ties evolve via a temporal stochastic block model simulating social support and conflict dynamics drawn from counseling theory, determining interaction frequency and partner selection. (3) Maladaptive trait expressions dynamically trigger behavior modifiers informed by counseling frameworks on maladaptive coping and alliance ruptures, modulating language to reflect distress or conflict. (4) Dialogue turns are generated using a large language model prompted with agent-specific behavioral parameters and contextual network states, ensuring psychological fidelity and linguistic diversity. Expert-annotated counseling dialogue transcripts inform algorithm parameterization and validation. This multi-layered formalism ensures reproducibility and realism in emergent social-personality interactions. The dataset will include dialogue transcripts, agent-level personality and social metadata, and evolving social network graphs, supporting a broad range of downstream benchmarking tasks.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collaborate with counseling psychology experts to define clinically validated personality and interaction dynamics schemas relevant to social support, therapeutic alliance, and maladaptive behaviors. 2) Develop agent-based simulation platform integrating DSM-5 personality trait vectors, counseling-informed social role evolution via temporal stochastic block models, and maladaptive behavior triggers derived from counseling frameworks. 3) Implement controlled prompting pipelines for an LLM (e.g., GPT-4) conditioned on dynamically evolving agent parameters and social context. 4) Generate synthetic multi-agent dialogues simulating varied counseling service scenarios (e.g., conflict resolution, support groups, committee meetings). 5) Validate psychological realism and counseling fidelity through human expert review and quantitative linguistic and network metrics. 6) Publicly release the annotated dataset with comprehensive documentation and code for reproducibility. 7) Benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs on integrated social-personality tasks including personality inference, network role prediction, and conflict detection, with analyses demonstrating dataset's novelty and impact.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Simulate a counseling group session where agents exhibit diverse DSM-5 personality profiles and dynamic therapeutic alliance shifts, including emergence of maladaptive coping behaviors. Output: Annotated dialogue transcripts enriched with personality traits, social network roles evolving over time, markers of therapeutic alliance development or ruptures, and a temporal social support network graph capturing changing interaction patterns.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If fully synthetic dialogues do not capture sufficient realism, we will incorporate a semi-synthetic approach by integrating anonymized, expert-annotated counseling session transcripts as seed data. Human-in-the-loop interventions will correct model outputs and refine simulation parameters to enhance psychological fidelity. We will also iteratively validate and recalibrate the social network evolution algorithms via expert feedback and empirical counseling studies, ensuring the dataset meets clinical and scientific standards."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines constructing synthetic multi-agent dialogues parameterized by DSM-5 personality profiles and social network roles with dynamic interaction patterns. However, it lacks clarity on how exactly the personality and social network parameters concretely influence dialogue generation in a controlled and reproducible manner. For example, it is unclear what models or algorithms govern the evolving social network roles and maladaptive trait expressions during conversations, or how these are integrated with the language model prompting. To strengthen the mechanism, the proposal should specify the computational framework and protocols for embedding these psychological and social dynamics into multi-agent interactions, ensuring both psychological fidelity and linguistic diversity that realistically reflect social support and maladaptive behaviors over time. This clarity is essential for scientific validity and reproducibility of the dataset construction process, as well as for interpreting downstream benchmarking results effectively. Please elaborate on these mechanistic details with concrete formalisms or algorithmic steps, possibly supported by prior work or pilot experiments if available."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the current scope, integrating knowledge or methodologies from the globally-linked concept of 'counseling services' could substantially enhance both impact and novelty. Specifically, incorporating data or theoretical frameworks from counseling psychology could provide enriched, clinically-validated personality interaction scenarios emphasizing practical psychological dynamics such as therapeutic alliance development, conflict resolution, or maladaptive behavior patterns often addressed in counseling. This would facilitate benchmarking LLMs on socially and clinically meaningful tasks beyond synthetic discourse simulation, advancing towards applications with societal and mental health relevance. Furthermore, collaboration with professionals in counseling services for expert annotations or scenario validation can increase dataset authenticity and broaden its use cases. This integration would differentiate the dataset from existing multi-agent benchmarks and build bridges between AI language modeling and applied psychological science, making the work more impactful and novel."
