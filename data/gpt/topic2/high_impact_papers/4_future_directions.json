        "title": "Neuro-Cognitive Language Modeling for Human Concept Formation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current language models lack integration with cognitive neuroscience constructs such as the default mode network (DMN) and self-referential processing, limiting their ability to authentically simulate human concept formation processes.",
        "Motivation": "This project addresses the internal gap regarding insufficient cognitive grounding in language models and capitalizes on the high-potential innovation opportunity to incorporate neuroscience insights, bridging models of human cognition with advanced machine learning architectures.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid neural architecture that integrates a symbolic model of the default mode network's activity with transformer-based language models. This architecture incorporates self-referential processing modules modeled on neuroscientific data to guide context adaptation and conceptual abstraction dynamically during language generation and understanding.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate neuroscience datasets detailing DMN activation patterns and self-referential cognitive tasks. 2) Implement modules simulating these processes as attention-guided layers within a transformer architecture. 3) Train on corpora annotated for human concept formation markers (e.g., conceptual metaphor, abstraction layers). 4) Evaluate against baseline language models on tasks measuring concept generation originality, human-likeness, and cognitive plausibility using human judgment and neuroscientific validation metrics.",
