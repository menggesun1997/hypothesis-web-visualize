Predictive brains, situated agents, and the future of cognitive science', 'abstract': 'Brains, it has recently been argued, are essentially prediction machines. They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing. Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success. This target article critically examines this \"hierarchical prediction machine\" approach, concluding that it offers the best clue yet to the shape of a unified science of mind and action. Sections 1 and 2 lay out the key elements and implications of the approach. Section 3 explores a variety of pitfalls and challenges, spanning the evidential, the methodological, and the more properly conceptual. The paper ends (sections 4 and 5) by asking how such approaches might impact our more general vision of mind, experience, and agency.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Handbook of Ethnography', 'abstract': 'NEW IN PAPERBACK. `I wish the Handbook of Ethnography had been available to me as a fledgling ethnographer.

Research is thus the foundation for knowledge. It produces evidence and informs actions that can provide wider benefit to a society. The knowledge that researchers cultivate from a piece of research can be adopted for social and health programs that can improve the health and well-being of the individuals, their communities and the societies in which they live. As we have witnessed in all corners of the globe, research has become an endeavor that most of us in the health and social sciences cannot avoid. This Handbook is conceived to provide the foundation to readers who wish to embark on a research project in order to form knowledge that they need. The Handbook comprises four main sections: Traditional research methods sciences; Innovative research methods; Doing cross-cultural research; and Sensitive research methodology and approach. This Handbook attests to the diversity and richness of research methods in the health and social sciences. It will benefit many readers, particularly students and researchers who undertake research in health and social science areas. It is also valuable for the training needs of postgraduate students who wish to undertake research in cross-cultural settings, with special groups of people, as it provides essential knowledge not only on the methods of data collection but also salient issues that they need to know if they wish to succeed in their research endeavors.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Encyclopedia of Neuroscience', 'abstract': 'Unique in its breadth and detail, this encyclopedia offers a comprehensive and highly readable guide to a complex and fast-expanding field.

Based on the general doctrine of diagrams in Charles Peirce\\'s mature work, Diagrammatology claims diagrams to constitute a centerpiece of epistemology. The book reflects Peirce\\'s work on the issue in Husserl\\'s contemporanous doctrine of \"categorial intuition\" and charts the many unnoticed similarities between Peircean semiotics and early Husserlian phenomenology. Diagrams, on a Peircean account, allow for observation and experimentation with ideal structures and objects and thus furnish the access to the synthetic a priori of the regional and formal ontology of the Husserlian tradition. The second part of the book focusses on three regional branches of semiotics: biosemiotics, picture analysis, and the theory of literature. Based on diagrammatology, these domains appear as accessible for a diagrammatological approach which leaves the traditional relativism and culturalism of semiotics behind and hence constitutes a realist semiotics Diagrams will never be the same. A fascinating and challenging tour through phenomenology, biology, Peirce\\'s theory of signs and Ingarden\\'s ontology of literature, all neatly tied together through the guiding thread of the diagrammatical. A veritable tour de force. Barry Smith, SUNY at Buffalo, U.S.A. With his meticulous scholarship, Frederik Stjernfelt shows that Peirce and Husserl were cultivating a broad and fertile common ground, which was largely neglected by both the analytic and the continental philosophers during the 20th century and which promises to be an exciting area of research in the 21st.

A limiting factor for a broader adoption of AI technology is the inherent risks that come with giving up human control and oversight to “intelligent” machines. Forsensitive tasks involving critical infrastructures and affecting human well-being or health, it is crucial to limit the possibility of improper, non-robust and unsafe decisions and actions. Before deploying an AI system, we see a strong need to validate its behavior, and thus establish guarantees that it will continue to perform as expected when deployed in a real-world environment. In pursuit of that objective, ways for humans to verify the agreement between the AI decision structure and their own ground-truth knowledge have been explored. Explainable AI (XAI) has developed as a subfield of AI, focused on exposing complex AI models to humans in a systematic and interpretable manner. The 22 chapters included in this book provide a timely snapshot of algorithms, theory, and applications of interpretable and explainable AI and AI techniques that have been proposed recently reflecting the current discourse in this field and providing directions of future development.

    "title": "Research Landscape Map: Using Contrastive Learning to Uncover Mechanistic Insights in Deep Language Models",
    "current_research_landscape": "This research cluster fundamentally focuses on understanding cognitive architectures and mechanistic underpinnings of mind and language processing by leveraging concepts like the 'hierarchical generative model', 'predictive brain', and 'top-down expectations'—reflective of the 'prediction machine' framework in cognitive science (notably from paper 1). These central concepts coalesce around building a unified 'science of mind' that accounts for perception and action through hierarchical predictions. The dominant methods surface as theoretical and computational modeling of hierarchical brain processes, ethnographic and qualitative inquiry into cognition and language (highlighted by the prominence of Paul Atkinson and ethnographic traditions), and increasingly, computational frameworks for model interpretability (as suggested by related foundational works in explainable AI). Thematic islands reflect a bifurcation: one centered on cognitive and neurocomputational predictive modeling, and the other on rigorous ethnographic and social-scientific traditions contextualizing language and identity. This interdisciplinary mixture underscores a paradigm that values mechanistic modeling alongside rich qualitative contextual insight. Together, these shape attempts to explain and interpret deep language models' internal mechanisms via contrastive learning methods that discern differences between predicted and actual representations, potentially elucidating top-down expectations encoded in model layers.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: The local network reveals no bridge nodes, indicating a conceptual divide between mechanistic generative models and ethnographic/social perspectives. This gap suggests limited integration of qualitative insights with computational predictive frameworks, possibly restricting a holistic understanding of deep language models' mechanistic insights. Additionally, foundational limitations noted in these papers include methodological challenges in validating hierarchical generative models experimentally and difficulties in directly mapping computational predictions to observable cognitive phenomena. There's also a scarcity of explicit frameworks for interpretability tailored to these mechanistic models within language AI.\n\nExternal/Novel Gaps: The Global Context identifies a hidden bridge between the 'hierarchical generative model' and ethnographic scholarship (Paul Atkinson), embedded in domains like biological psychology and pharmacology, which remain unexplored in the local cluster. Notably, concepts such as 'social care integration', 'spaces of governance', and 'politics of anticipation' emerge as social-scientific and systemic perspectives correlated with predictive modeling. These suggest opportunity zones where cognitive predictive models could integrate societal, cultural, and institutional dynamics—thereby enriching mechanistic insights with contextually grounded social models. Furthermore, connections to 'avoidance achievement motivation' and 'test anxiety' imply prospective interdisciplinary ties to motivation and affective states influencing language processing, overlooked in the existing cluster. These unseen bridges offer potential to extend mechanistic insights beyond brain and language modeling to embodied, situated, and socially distributed cognition.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate social care and governance frameworks (from the hidden bridge concepts 'social care integration' and 'spaces of governance') with hierarchical predictive modeling methods (B2 thematic cluster) to develop multi-level contrastive learning frameworks. These frameworks could mechanistically capture how language models simulate social anticipation and decision-making processes, addressing the internal gap of limited societal context in current mechanisms.\n\nOpportunity 2: Bridge ethnographic methodologies championed by Paul Atkinson with computational contrastive learning on deep language models to create hybrid models that leverage qualitative data for model interpretability. This addresses the internal methodological gap by combining qualitative insights into identity and language use with mechanistic model explanations, enriching the explanatory power and human relevance of AI interpretability.\n\nOpportunity 3: Exploit connections to biological psychology concepts like 'avoidance achievement motivation' and 'test anxiety' by embedding affective and motivational states into hierarchical generative frameworks used in language models. This novel cross-disciplinary approach could offer new mechanistic insights into how latent motivational variables influence language representations and predictions, thus expanding the mechanistic explanatory scope beyond pure perception-action loops."
