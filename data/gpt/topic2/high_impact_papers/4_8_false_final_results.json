    "title": "Open-Source Ethical Knowledge Graphs for Transparent Concept Modeling",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of openly accessible, ethically curated knowledge graphs limits transparency and accountability in language models' concept formation in socio-technical domains.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the gap in ethical and epistemic challenges by creating foundational open-source infrastructures that integrate ethical, legal, and social information into concept modeling.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop and release an open-source knowledge graph incorporating ethical, legal, and socio-technical concept nodes linked with provenance data and uncertainty annotations. Integrate this graph as an external reasoning layer accessible to language models during training and inference.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Aggregate and curate data from legal statutes, ethical guidelines, and socio-technical datasets. 2) Construct a semantic graph with rich annotations. 3) Implement retrieval-augmented language model access to the graph. 4) Evaluate transparency, ethical awareness, and trustworthiness via user studies and benchmark tasks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Generate a policy recommendation considering privacy and fairness in AI governance.\" Expected output: Recommendations grounded on explicit ethical-legal knowledge graph reasoning showing traceability and accountability.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If graph integration is computationally intensive, fallback to embedding distillation from graphs into model parameters or on-demand graph querying during post-processing."
