    "title": "TrustLens: User-Centric Interpretability Metrics Integrating Psychological Trust Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current interpretability metrics for language models lack incorporation of user trust dynamics, especially in conversational AI interacting in multimedia environments. This limits understanding of how explanations affect user trust and decision-making.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient user-centric interpretability assessments and exploits the hidden bridge between communication research and psychology domains integrating technology trust constructs. This is novel by explicitly modeling user trust as an interpretability metric, uniting communication and psychological insights.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design and implement TrustLens, a framework that quantifies interpretability not only by model explainability features but also by measuring user trust via psychological constructs (e.g., perceived reliability, transparency). The method combines post-hoc explanation generation with user feedback collected through interactive multimedia dialogues to dynamically adapt explanations fostering trust.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect conversational data with multimedia context. 2) Build XAI explanation modules (attention visualization, causal attributions). 3) Develop surveys and experiments for users rating trust-related metrics during interaction. 4) Analyze correlations between explanations and trust scores. 5) Compare TrustLens with traditional interpretability metrics and assess impact on user trust and decision efficacy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User asks a healthcare chatbot about medication side effects with visual aids. Output: Explanations presented via textual justifications complemented by highlight overlays on multimedia content. Expected: Users report higher trust scores and better understanding via the TrustLens-adapted explanations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If user trust is hard to quantify reliably, fallback to qualitative interviews and focus groups to gather interpretability feedback. Alternatively, simulate trust via proxy behavioral metrics (e.g., continued interaction, adherence)."

        "title": "TrustLens+: A Multimodal, User-Centric Interpretability Framework Integrating Psychological Trust and Real-Time Emotion Recognition in Multimedia Conversational AI",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing interpretability metrics for language models inadequately capture the dynamic interplay between user trust and multimodal conversational AI explanations, especially in sensitive, multimedia environments such as healthcare chatbots. Current approaches predominantly rely on static, self-reported trust measures without incorporating implicit affective signals, limiting the understanding of how explanations influence user trust, engagement, and decision-making over time.",
        "Motivation": "To address the NOV-COMPETITIVE landscape of explainable AI, TrustLens+ proposes a fundamental advance by synergistically integrating dynamic psychological trust constructs with state-of-the-art automatic emotion detection and speech emotion recognition techniques. This multimodal user-centric interpretability framework bridges communication, psychology, and human-computer interaction (HCI), enabling richer, real-time, and adaptive explanations that reflect both explicit trust feedback and implicit emotional cues. By incorporating validated psychological scales alongside continuous affective state monitoring, TrustLens+ uniquely positions itself to model trust as a composite, evolving metric—greatly enhancing trust assessment robustness and explanation relevance in complex multimedia conversational AI systems, such as smart healthcare assistants. This cross-disciplinary approach extends prior methods, enhances scientific rigor, and raises practical and theoretical impact in socially interactive AI.",
        "Proposed_Method": "The TrustLens+ framework combines post-hoc explainability modules with a multimodal user trust assessment pipeline comprising: 1) Validated psychological trust constructs (e.g., perceived reliability, transparency) captured through carefully designed, bias-minimized surveys embedded during conversational sessions; 2) Real-time automatic emotion detection and speech emotion recognition to infer implicit trust-related affective states continuously from user voice and facial expressions; 3) Integration of these explicit and implicit trust signals into a dynamic trust model that adapts explanation content and presentation modality in subsequent interactions. In collaboration with HCI experts, an intuitive explanation interface transparently surfaces trust metrics and adapts explanations contextually to users' emotional and trust profiles during multimedia dialogues. The framework ensures ethical data handling, participant privacy, and consent procedures tailored to sensitive domains like healthcare. By fusing rigorous psychological measurement protocols with advanced affective computing and HCI design, TrustLens+ pioneers a new class of context-aware, trust-aware AI explanation systems.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Collection: Recruit a diverse participant cohort (N=120), balanced for age, gender, cultural background, and healthcare literacy, through institutional ethical approvals with informed consent emphasizing data privacy. Collect conversational multimedia datasets in a simulated healthcare chatbot environment including video, audio, and dialogue logs, targeting at least 300 interaction sessions for statistical power (alpha=0.05, power=0.8) to detect trust metric variations. 2) Explanation Modules: Develop explainable AI modules producing attention visualizations, causal attributions, and multimodal highlight overlays tailored for healthcare queries. 3) Trust Metrics Design: Employ validated psychological trust scales such as the Trust in Automation Scale with minor refinements to reduce bias, administered at multiple time points during the sessions. 4) Emotion Recognition Integration: Implement and validate automatic emotion detection and speech emotion recognition pipelines using open-source pretrained models and domain fine-tuning, cross-validated with manual annotations for accuracy exceeding 85%. 5) Dynamic Adaptation Mechanism: Operationalize explanation adaptation algorithms that modulate explanation depth, modality, and content based on fused trust-emotion models. 6) Experimental Controls: Implement control conditions (static explanations without adaptation, no emotion integration) for comparative assessment. 7) Data Analysis: Use mixed-effects modeling to analyze trust evolution and correlate explicit and implicit trust metrics with explanation types. 8) Usability and Ethical Assessment: Conduct focus groups and qualitative interviews to triangulate quantitative findings and ensure ethical compliance and participant well-being throughout. 9) Replicability: Publish detailed protocols, datasets (de-identified), and code to enable independent replication and extension.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user interacts with a healthcare chatbot about medication side effects, supported by textual descriptions and visual content (e.g., pill images). TrustLens+ presents explanations combining textual justifications and spotlight overlays on multimedia elements. The system continuously measures trust via in-session surveys and analyzes the user's emotional cues (facial expressions, vocal intonation) in real-time. Output: Explanations dynamically adapt—simplifying or elaborating content—based on detected low trust or negative affect signals, transparently displaying trust scores on the interface. Expected: Participants report higher trust reliability scores and demonstrate improved medication comprehension and adherence intentions. Implicit trust metrics (e.g., reduced negative emotional valence) align with explicit ratings, confirming the efficacy of TrustLens+'s multimodal trust model and adaptive explanations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If challenges arise in reliably quantifying trust via emotion recognition due to model limitations or privacy concerns, fallback strategies include: a) employing solely high-quality, validated, bias-reduced psychological survey instruments administered more frequently; b) integrating proxy behavioral trust indicators such as session length, repeated usage, and task completion rates; c) conducting in-depth qualitative interviews and focus groups to capture nuanced interpretability feedback; d) enhancing consent protocols and anonymization techniques to address privacy and ethical concerns; e) incremental piloting to refine the integration pipeline before full-scale deployment. Such contingencies ensure continued progress and robustness of TrustLens+ in dynamically modeling and adapting to user trust within multimedia conversational AI environments."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a plausible approach but lacks detail on key experimental design aspects critical for feasibility. For example, collecting conversational data with multimedia contexts (Step 1) needs clearer specification on data sources, participant demographics, and the scale required to support statistically meaningful analysis. Similarly, the surveys and experiments for capturing user trust during interactions (Step 3) should be designed to minimize biases and include validated psychological scales. Clarify how dynamic adaptation of explanations will be operationalized and evaluated over sessions. Address these gaps by detailing experimental controls, recruitment criteria, sample size estimation, and precise metrics to ensure replicability and robustness of findings in real-world multimedia conversational AI settings. This will increase confidence in feasibility and scientific rigor of the evaluation plan, mitigating potential risks related to trust measurement and adaptation efficacy testing during the interaction cycles. This level of detail is essential given the complexity of integrating psychological trust constructs with AI interpretability metrics and user studies involving multimedia dialogues, which pose non-trivial logistical and methodological challenges that could hinder successful execution otherwise.  Provide technical clarity on instrument validation and data collection protocols to strengthen feasibility assessment for the reviewers and stakeholders involved in future implementation phases.  Also consider data privacy, consent, and ethical aspects given the sensitive nature of trust in healthcare/chatbot settings mentioned in test cases, to feasibly accommodate participant protections and institutional approvals essential for deployment and evaluation phases to succeed consistently across diverse user populations.  Incorporating these practical experiment design improvements will greatly enhance feasibility, mitigating potential under-specified risks in the proposal's current form, and will solidify trustworthiness and generalizability of outcome interpretations from the user-centric trust modeling framework TrustLens aims to pioneer.  Overall, expand the experimental plan with scientifically grounded, operationalized details and contingency strategies for key phases related to user studies and trust metric validation for stronger feasibility endorsement."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty rating of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the inspirational globally-linked concepts provided, consider explicitly integrating recent advances in 'automatic emotion detection' and 'speech emotion recognition' into TrustLens. This integration can enrich psychological trust modeling by incorporating real-time affective state signals alongside self-reported trust measures, providing a multimodal trust metric that captures implicit user trust cues from emotion recognition. Embedding this emotional context within multimedia conversational AI explanations can help dynamically tailor explanations not only based on user feedback but also on detected emotional states, potentially improving the accuracy and responsiveness of TrustLens’s adaptive explanations. Additionally, linking with 'human-computer interaction' and 'integration of AI technology' domains, strengthen the interdisciplinarity by collaborating with HCI experts to design intuitive interfaces that surface trust metrics transparently to users, improving engagement and usability. This cross-disciplinary enrichment would significantly broaden TrustLens’s impact and novelty by moving beyond static surveys toward real-time, context-aware, affective user-centric interpretability metrics, thereby positioning the work at the forefront of explainable AI research in socially interactive, multimodal environments such as smart healthcare chatbots. By evolving TrustLens in this direction, the framework can pioneer a new class of trust-aware AI systems that better manage nuanced human factors through sophisticated emotion and trust interplay modeling, thus addressing the competitive landscape innovatively and raising the research’s visibility and practical significance."
