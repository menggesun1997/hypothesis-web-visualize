    "title": "Cross-Lingual DSM-5-Informed Personality Taxonomy for Multicultural LLM Evaluation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Psychological personality constructs are primarily validated in Western contexts, limiting benchmarking applicability in multilingual, multicultural settings for LLMs.",
    "Motivation": "Directly addresses external linguistic and cultural equity gaps by constructing a validated, cross-lingual DSM-5 personality taxonomy usable in LLM benchmarks across cultures and languages (Opportunity 3).",
    "Proposed_Method": "Synthesize a multilingual personality taxonomy by mapping DSM-5 trait constructs onto culturally adapted personality trait inventories from psychology across languages. Use cross-lingual embedding alignment and expert validation to ensure conceptual equivalence. Integrate taxonomy into LLM personality evaluation pipelines for scientifically multicultural assessment.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather DSM-5 and multicultural personality trait datasets. 2) Employ translation and cultural adaptation procedures with expert panels. 3) Create cross-lingual embedding maps of traits. 4) Deploy taxonomy in benchmarking multilingual LLM outputs. 5) Evaluate with culture fairness metrics and psychological construct validity tests.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multilingual LLM response to 'Describe leadership behaviors' prompt in different languages. Output: Personality trait scores mapped onto culturally adapted taxonomy, showing comparable interpretations across cultures.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cross-cultural equivalence is weak, focus on a subset of languages with more similar cultural psychology and gradually extend taxonomy."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines mapping DSM-5 traits onto culturally adapted inventories via cross-lingual embedding alignment and expert validation, which is promising but currently underspecified. There is insufficient detail on how conceptual equivalence will be quantitatively assessed or how discrepancies across languages and cultures will be reconciled during embedding alignment. Clarify the methods for measuring semantic and psychological trait alignment (e.g., similarity metrics, alignment loss functions) and procedures to validate embedding maps against expert judgments. Enhancing methodological transparency is critical to establish soundness and reproducibility of the approach, especially given the complexity of personality constructs across cultures and languages, which are not trivially mappable via embeddings alone. Include specific strategies to handle cultural biases or construct non-equivalence to ensure robustness of the taxonomy integration into LLM evaluation pipelines. Target Section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is logical but would benefit from more explicit operationalization to ensure feasibility. For example, the cultural adaptation and expert validation step lacks detailed criteria for selecting experts, standardizing translation and adaptation protocols, or metrics for construct validity. Additionally, the cross-lingual embedding mapping step should specify embedding models to be used, alignment techniques, and evaluation benchmarks to guarantee meaningful trait alignment. Given the complexity of multicultural psychological constructs, consider iterative pilot studies with smaller language sets before full deployment, and define success criteria clearly (e.g., measurable equivalence thresholds, fairness metrics). Address potential data scarcity or quality issues upfront, as diverse, high-quality multicultural trait datasets can be scarce. Improving detail and rigor in the experiment plan will greatly increase the practical feasibility and eventual impact of the research. Target Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
