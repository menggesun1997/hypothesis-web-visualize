    "Problem_Statement": "There is a conceptual divide between qualitative ethnographic insights into language and computational interpretability methods, restricting explanations of language model behavior that capture identity and social nuance.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the internal methodological gap of lacking frameworks that combine ethnographic methodologies with computational contrastive learning, this work blends Paul Atkinson's qualitative traditions with mechanistic contrastive modeling to yield hybrid, human-relevant interpretability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a hybrid interpretability model that integrates ethnographic annotation data (e.g., discourse markers indicating identity, social roles) into contrastive learning objectives. The language model learns to distinguish contrasting social meanings and identities encoded in language, guided by qualitative labels, thus grounding mechanistic explanations in ethnographic reality.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct datasets of conversational text richly annotated with ethnographic social identity features. 2) Implement contrastive losses that maximize representation differences aligned with ethnographic categories. 3) Evaluate model interpretability through qualitative expert assessment and quantitative metrics of social meaning separability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Conversational excerpt with identity markers like code-switching.\nExpected Output: Model layers reveal distinct embeddings corresponding to identity shifts, explaining language generation decisions linked to social context.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If annotations are noisy or scarce, experiment with semi-supervised approaches or data augmentation using synthetic ethnographic narratives. Explore attention-based explanation methods to complement contrastive interpretations."

        "title": "Ethno-Contrastive Interpretability: Bridging Qualitative Linguistics with AI Mechanisms",
        "Problem_Statement": "There is a conceptual and methodological divide between qualitative ethnographic insights into language use—especially social identity and interactional nuance—and current computational interpretability methods. This divide limits the development of language model explanations that authentically reflect sociolinguistic realities and identity-driven language variation.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work in AI interpretability has largely focused on mechanistic explanations devoid of rich social context, and sociolinguistics deeply analyzes language variation and identity, these domains remain siloed. This proposal aims to bridge that gap by explicitly integrating ethnomethodological conversation analysis principles and corpus linguistics insights—for example, social interaction markers and language variation frameworks from the Routledge and Oxford Handbooks—into computational interpretability. By doing so, the work aspires not only to advance human-relevant mechanistic interpretability but also to serve as a novel empirical tool for applied linguistics and sociolinguistics research on language use, cross-cultural communication, and social identity. This multidisciplinary synthesis enhances novelty beyond competitive baselines, fostering collaboration and broadening impact across AI and social sciences.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel hybrid interpretability framework that quantitatively operationalizes ethnographic annotations grounded in interdisciplinary social linguistic theories to guide contrastive learning within language models. Specifically:\n\n1) Ethnographic data will be annotated using well-established sociolinguistic markers—such as turn-taking cues, code-switching points, discourse markers signaling social roles, and language variation features derived from corpus linguistics and conversation analysis literature.\n\n2) These qualitative annotations will be mapped onto contrastive learning objectives by defining positive pairs as utterances sharing social identity or interactional features, and negative pairs as those differing along one or more such axes. This multi-label contrastive approach integrates multiple social identity dimensions simultaneously.\n\n3) Within the model architecture, we introduce an auxiliary supervised contrastive loss module connected to intermediate language model representations. This module employs a projection head that aligns embedding space neighborhoods with ethnographically defined social categories, explicitly encoding social identity dimensions.\n\n4) Technically, the framework includes pseudocode and architectural diagrams illustrating the data flow from ethnographic annotation to contrastive batch construction, loss computation, and joint optimization alongside standard language modeling objectives.\n\n5) To validate alignment with sociolinguistic theory, quantitative embedding analyses will be paired with think-aloud protocol evaluations from expert linguists assessing the salience of social interaction features in model explanations.\n\n6) Attention mechanisms and probing classifiers will further dissect how these identity annotations modulate internal representation layers, grounding mechanistic interpretability in ethnographic reality.\n\nThis explicit formalization and modular approach ensure reproducibility and position the model as an innovative mechanism that fuses rigorous social science with state-of-the-art AI interpretability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate and enrich conversational datasets with detailed ethnographic annotations incorporating social identity markers from sociolinguistics and conversation analysis, guided by frameworks in the Routledge and Oxford Handbooks.\n\n2) Design data loaders and contrastive batch samplers that operationalize multi-dimension positive/negative pair selection based on ethnographic labels.\n\n3) Implement the supervised contrastive loss module integrated with a standard pre-trained language model, including the projection head and joint optimization schedule.\n\n4) Conduct training and validate using quantitative metrics such as cluster separability in embedding space, adjusted Rand index for identity grouping, and downstream language modeling performance.\n\n5) Perform qualitative assessments with linguistic experts employing think-aloud protocols to interpret model explanation outputs, ensuring social meaning is salient and interpretable.\n\n6) Analyze internal attention distributions and apply probing classifiers to identify how social identity features manifest and are represented across layers.\n\n7) Compare results against baselines without ethnographic supervision and with simpler annotation schemes to demonstrate superiority and added value.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A conversational transcript segment exhibiting code-switching between two languages, with utterances annotated for speaker social roles and turn-taking cues.\n\nExpected Output: \n- The model’s intermediate layers produce distinct representation clusters for utterances differing in language choice and social role.\n- Contrastive loss enforces embedding separation consistent with ethnographic labels.\n- Attention patterns highlight discourse markers signaling identity shifts.\n- Expert analysis confirms that explanations reflect meaningful social interaction features, not just lexical differences.\n- The model’s behavior and explanations align with frameworks from conversation analysis, showing practical relevance for sociolinguistics.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If annotated data quantity or quality proves insufficient, we will apply semi-supervised learning methods such as pseudo-labeling with domain adaptation, leveraging synthetically generated ethnographic narratives informed by sociolinguistic typologies to augment training.\n\nComplementary interpretability approaches like attention-based saliency maps or gradient-based attribution will be employed to triangulate and validate contrastive findings.\n\nAlternatively, we will explore disentangled representation learning to isolate social dimensions when explicit annotation guidance is limited, ensuring robustness and interpretability remain achievable."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines integrating ethnographic annotation data into contrastive learning objectives to yield human-relevant interpretability. However, the mechanism of how exactly qualitative annotations will quantitatively guide the contrastive loss and how this grounding will technically manifest in the model's internal representations needs elaboration. For instance, is there a defined mapping from ethnographic labels to contrastive positives/negatives, and how will multiple social identity features be integrated within the model's architecture? Clarifying these technical details will strengthen the conceptual soundness and facilitate reproducibility and validation by others, especially given the novelty lies in bridging qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Consider including a concrete architectural diagram or pseudocode to demonstrate the integration and interplay between ethnographic data and contrastive objectives within the language model framework. This will ensure the research idea is not only novel but also technically grounded and clear in its implementation plan, fulfilling the core aim of mechanistic interpretability grounded in ethnographic insights without ambiguity or overgeneralization in method design.\n\nTarget: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty assessment classified this work as NOV-COMPETITIVE, to enhance both its novelty and broader impact, the proposal should explicitly connect its methodology and findings to well-established interdisciplinary frameworks from sociolinguistics and conversation analysis—particularly concepts like ethnomethodological conversation analysis and the study of language variation. For example, incorporating theories from the Routledge Handbook or the Oxford Handbook on sociolinguistics could position the model as a tool not just for AI interpretability but for advancing empirical social science research on language use, identity, and cross-cultural communication. \n\nThis can be achieved by expanding the ethnographic feature annotations with established social interaction markers from corpus linguistics and conversation analysis, or using think-aloud protocols to validate model explanations with human linguistic experts. Engaging with these globally linked concepts will help situate the contribution at the nexus of AI interpretability and applied linguistics, thereby widening its audience and solidifying its competitive edge in a crowded research landscape. It also encourages collaboration, dataset sharing, and impact in social science domains alongside AI, ultimately broadening the research's scope and applicability.\n\nTarget: Motivation"
