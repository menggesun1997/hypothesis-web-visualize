    "title": "Equity-Centered Semantic Network Metrics for Evaluating Language Model Social Behavior Across Cultures",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current semantic network analyses do not incorporate equity-centered metrics that capture fairness and inclusivity in social behavior modeling across cultural contexts in LLMs.",
    "Motivation": "Targets critical external gap related to digital multilingual and equity considerations by introducing novel equity metrics within semantic-social personality benchmarking frameworks (Opportunity 3).",
    "Proposed_Method": "Define new semantic network metrics that quantify equity aspects such as representation balance of minority social groups, avoidance of cultural biases in personality expression, and cross-cultural fairness in social interaction patterns. Integrate these metrics into existing network analysis pipelines to assess scientific LLM social outputs more holistically.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Review social science literature to formalize equity metrics relevant to semantic networks. 2) Implement computational proxies for these metrics. 3) Apply to multilingual LLM-generated social dialogues. 4) Benchmark models on traditional and equity metrics. 5) Analyze correlation of equity metrics with downstream fairness in scientific language tasks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Social interaction transcripts involving culturally diverse personas. Output: Reports quantifying fairness of representation and cultural inclusivity metrics within semantic networks.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If equity metrics show low sensitivity, extend with human-annotated fairness evaluations and retrain metric models for improved detection."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that equity-centered metrics can be meaningfully and objectively operationalized within semantic network analyses for diverse cultural contexts, but it does not sufficiently justify how these complex social constructs (e.g., fairness, cultural inclusivity) will be reliably quantified in a computational framework. Clarify and justify the core assumptions on how social science equity concepts will translate into robust semantic network metrics to ensure soundness of the foundational premise and avoid overly simplistic proxies that may not capture nuance in multicultural LLM outputs. This will help establish the validity of the approach before implementation phases begin, reducing risk of misalignment between social equity theory and computational instantiation, which is critical given the sensitivity and complexity of cultural fairness assessment in language models and social personality benchmarks. Provide citations or preliminary conceptual frameworks from social sciences linking equity concepts explicitly to semantic network structures to strengthen this foundational assumption and its operationalization path in Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan sections. This is a must-address prior to deeper experimental commitments to avoid unsound premise risks and increase confidence in downstream metric utility and fairness assessments. Target sections: Problem_Statement, Proposed_Method, Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The experimental plan is detailed but has risks in terms of feasibility and sensitivity of computational proxies for equity-related semantic metrics. Step 5 proposes correlating new equity metrics with fairness outcomes in scientific language tasks, but this downstream evaluation is underspecified and may be methodologically challenging given subjectivity and cultural complexity. Further, the fallback plan involving human annotations and retraining metrics may be costly and time-consuming without clearer criteria for success or metric sensitivity thresholds. Strengthen feasibility by providing more concrete plans for validating computational proxies quantitatively and qualitatively, outlining evaluation datasets, annotation protocols, and statistical methods to assess the metrics' reliability and cultural validity. Consider piloting simpler sub-tasks or smaller-scale studies before scaling to multilingual LLM social dialogues to build incremental validation. Address potential scalability and annotation resource constraints explicitly, perhaps by proposing active learning or semi-supervised methods to reduce annotation load. This detailed feasibility analysis and clear success criteria will reduce development risks and improve confidence that the proposed equity metrics can be realized and practically useful within the planned timeline.
