        "title": "Dynamic Multi-Agent Social Support Network Simulation Embedded in LLM Personality Evaluation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM personality benchmarks lack an explicit modeling of social support influence on personality expression, omitting dynamic social interactions reflective of real-world contexts such as social media networks. This gap limits psychological realism and ecological validity in evaluating personality traits.",
        "Motivation": "While existing benchmarks evaluate LLM personalities in isolation, human personality expression is deeply shaped by dynamic social environments and support networks. By integrating multi-agent social simulations grounded in social support theories and leveraging social media-inspired network structures, this work addresses internal psychological richness and external contextual authenticity. This approach differentiates by precisely modeling how social network influences propagate and modulate LLM internal states, substantially advancing benchmarks beyond static evaluations toward socially embedded interactive agents.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel benchmarking framework involving multiple interacting LLM agents whose personality outputs are conditioned on dynamic social support networks inspired by social media interaction graphs. The social support network is represented as a weighted, directed graph G = (V, E, W), where nodes V correspond to LLM agents, edges E represent social ties with weights W quantifying support strength. The social influence propagation mechanism modulates the contextual embeddings fed into each LLM through a mathematically defined influence function.\n\nSpecifically, for each agent i, the adjusted contextual embedding E'_i is computed as:\n\nE'_i = E_i + α * Σ_{j ∈ N(i)} w_{ji} * f(E_j)\n\nwhere E_i is the base embedding for the prompt, N(i) denotes neighbors providing social support to i, w_{ji} the normalized support weight from agent j to i, f(·) a learned transformation network (e.g., a small neural module) encoding influence propagation, and α a hyperparameter controlling influence strength. This embedding augmentation effectively shifts the internal representation reflecting perceived social support, which the LLM uses to generate personality trait expressions.\n\nThe multi-agent system operates in iterative conversational rounds, simulating evolving social dynamics. Agents produce personality-conditioned responses influenced by their current support embeddings, enabling emergent behavior assessments. Social media data structures inform graph topology and evolution.\n\nA concrete schematic includes: initial base prompt embeddings → social influence aggregation using weighted neighbor embeddings through influence function → formation of augmented embeddings → input to LLM personality generation modules → output personality trait metrics. This pipeline is novel in explicitly formalizing and engineering the interaction between social graph weights and LLM internal states to reflect social support impact realistically.\n\nThis method boosts novelty and reproducibility beyond prior work by combining rigorous mathematical conditioning, multi-agent interaction, and real-world inspired social network dynamics.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate and preprocess social media interaction datasets to construct realistic weighted directed social support graphs.\n2) Implement the influence propagation function f(·) as a neural transformation module trained to align embedding shifts with psychological social support theory.\n3) Integrate the influence mechanism into prompt embedding conditioning pipelines for each LLM agent.\n4) Establish a multi-agent conversational environment where agents exchange prompts and update embeddings iteratively to simulate dynamic social support.\n5) Measure personality trait outputs per agent under varying graph weight configurations and interaction sequences.\n6) Analyze correlations between network-derived social support parameters and emergent personality expressions quantitatively.\n7) Validate outputs with expert psychological assessments to confirm realism and theoretical consistency.\n8) Conduct ablation studies varying α, graph topologies, and influence functions to determine key factors influencing effectiveness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: In a multi-agent dialogue scenario, Agent A receives high-weighted social support from Agents B and C (e.g., strong positive interactions on social media), promoting positive coping strategy generation when prompted with \"Describe coping strategies for stress.\" The augmented embedding incorporates this influence.\n\nExpected Output (Agent A): Positive, proactive, resilient communication with supportive framing.\n\nUnder low support or negative weight contexts, Agent A's output shifts toward withdrawn or anxious responses, reflecting reduced social support.\n\nSuch test cases include varying social network densities, tie strengths, and dynamic changes in social support during simulated multi-agent interaction rounds.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If embedding conditioning via the influence function demonstrates limited modulation of LLM personality outputs, we will integrate reinforcement learning techniques where agents receive reward signals based on psychological validity of personality expressions under social support conditions. This RL fine-tuning can enhance alignment between social influence embeddings and generated personality traits, ensuring stronger conditioning effects and improving the robustness of the simulation framework."

Clarify the exact mechanism for embedding conditioning, the mathematical formulation of influence propagation from network weights to embeddings, and how this altered context will interact with the LLM's personality trait generation. Providing a concrete example or schematic would enhance clarity and credibility, ensuring this novel mechanism is convincingly sound rather than conceptually vague or speculative without engineering proof-of-concept evidence. This will strengthen confidence in the soundness of the approach and its contribution beyond existing personality evaluation benchmarks that lack social context modeling. Targeting precise embedding integration methods and their impact on LLM outputs is essential to establish mechanistic validity and reproducibility of the approach in the Proposed_Method section."

For instance, extend the simulation framework to model dynamic multi-agent social interactions where multiple LLM personalities interact under varying social support conditions, closer to real-world social networks. Alternatively, incorporating social media as a data source for graph construction or embedding real-time social dynamics could improve ecological validity and relevance. Such integration would deepen the psychological and social realism of the evaluations and broaden applicability beyond isolated personality benchmarks to interactive, socially-embedded agent modeling. Explicitly proposing this integration in the final research agenda or future work would enhance novelty and potential impact, positioning the work as a foundational bridge between LLM personality modeling and socially grounded computational social science."
