    "title": "Causal Graph Neural Networks for Modeling LLM Synthetic Personality and Social Interaction",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs lack benchmark frameworks that reveal underlying causal mechanisms in personality and social behavior modeling, limiting explanatory depth.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to the lack of models explaining causal or psychological mechanisms beyond predictive accuracy (critical internal gap). This method integrates causal graph structures into neural architectures tailored for personality and social network fusion.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a Causal Graph Neural Network (CGNN) architecture that encodes DSM-5 personality trait causal graphs along with social network interactions as input features. The CGNN conditions LLM-generated language outputs, enabling simultaneous modeling of causal personality factors and social context cues. The model learns to predict personality-social outcomes with explicit causal interpretability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Extract causal personality trait graphs from clinical psychology data. 2) Collect social network interaction datasets annotated with trait labels. 3) Construct CGNN modules and integrate with LLMs via adapter layers. 4) Train end-to-end on personality prediction and social behavior simulation tasks. 5) Evaluate via causal inference metrics, predictive accuracy, and human expert validation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Personality-social scenario prompt: \"Model an individual's social support response given high avoidant personality traits.\" Output: Textual explanation grounded in causal graphs illustrating behavioral tendencies and social engagement patterns.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If CGNN integration is too computationally intensive, develop decoupled pipelines: first predict causal traits with CGNN, then generate language outputs conditioned on predicted traits through a second LLM stage."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed causal graph neural network (CGNN) integration with LLMs via adapter layers is conceptually promising but lacks detailed clarity on the precise mechanism of fusion and causal information flow. Specifically, it is unclear how causal graphs derived from DSM-5 traits will be encoded, represented, and effectively influence LLM language generation beyond conditioning. The interplay between social network inputs and personality trait causal graphs within CGNN should be elaborated, including how conflict resolution, weighting, and inference are handled in the model. Articulating these mechanisms is critical for establishing soundness and reproducibility of the approach, as well as for understanding the causal interpretability claims. Providing a more formal model description or architectural schematic will greatly strengthen the submission's core plausibility and technical contributions. This should be prioritized before proceeding to experiments to avoid ambiguity or implementation risks in integration steps."

          "feedback_code": "IMP-BROADEN_IMPACT",
          "feedback_content": "While modeling causal personality factors and social interactions in LLM-generated language is novel, the problem statement and proposed use case focus narrowly on clinical psychology constructs (DSM-5 traits) and social behavior simulation. This potentially limits broader applicability to more diverse domains such as organizational psychology, intercultural communication, or even synthetic agents in complex social networks. To increase impact, the authors should consider illustrating how this framework could be generalized or applied to related fields (e.g., network biology metaphors, or nutritional sciences influence on behavior patterns as linked concepts suggest). Expanding test cases beyond personality-social clinical scenarios to more interdisciplinary or societally relevant interactions will make the work stand out in a competitive landscape. Demonstrating flexibility in causal graph inputs or multi-modal social data could enhance both novelty and relevance."
