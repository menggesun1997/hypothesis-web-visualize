    "title": "Psychological Causality Embedding for LLM Personality Validity",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current benchmarks for synthetic personalities in language models lack grounding in psychological causality, reducing their explanatory power about modeled behaviors.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the gap in psychological validity of personality measurements in LLMs and the absence of integration of causal psychological traits (critical gaps, Opportunity 1). This introduces causal reasoning into synthetic personality modeling for deep interpretability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel embedding layer for language models that integrates causal psychological trait embeddings derived from DSM-5 maladaptive personality constructs, combined with social support mechanisms representations. This embedding conditions the LLM's responses during personality benchmarking tasks, allowing the model to generate outputs explainable via psychological causal pathways rather than only correlations. The framework jointly learns to align semantic output patterns with structured causal graphs derived from clinical psychology datasets.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets embedding DSM-5 personality disorder traits and social support metrics from clinical and social psychology literature. 2) Design causal graphs representing interrelations between these psychological traits. 3) Adapt an LLM (e.g., GPT) with the causal embedding layer, fine-tune on personality profiling tasks. 4) Benchmark against standard personality testing (e.g. Big Five) and existing synthetic personality metrics. 5) Evaluate using metrics of psychological validity: causal consistency, interpretability scores, and external validation by expert psychologists.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Describe an individual's communication style reflecting high social support and low maladaptive traits.\" Output: \"The person demonstrates empathetic and cooperative interactions, fostering trust and positive social bonds, indicative of resilient and adaptive personality.\"",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If causal embedding training proves unstable, fallback to semi-supervised mapping of DSM-5 trait proxies as auxiliary labels for multitask learning, reinforcing trait correlations without strict causality. Alternatively, expand to include broader social psychology datasets to improve robustness."

        "title": "Causally Grounded Psychological Embeddings for Socially Adaptive AI Agents",
        "Problem_Statement": "Traditional synthetic personality benchmarks in language models are limited by correlational trait assessments lacking explicit psychological causality, which reduces their explanatory and practical power. Moreover, existing approaches do not extend causal personality modeling to embodied AI agents, missing opportunities for socially adaptive, psychologically valid behavior conditioning.",
        "Motivation": "This proposal addresses critical gaps in psychological validity and causal interpretability of personality modeling in large language models (LLMs), advancing beyond correlation-based profiling toward embedding structured psychological causality. By explicitly operationalizing causal mechanisms grounded in DSM-5 maladaptive personality constructs and social support factors, and integrating these embeddings into interactive AI agent architectures, we aim to enhance both interpretability and applied social intelligence. This integration significantly advances prior work by bridging clinical psychology, causal representation learning, and embodied intelligent systems, demonstrating novelty and impact in enabling socially aware AI agents with causally grounded personality conditioning.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel, modular Causally Grounded Psychological Embedding (CGPE) layer that encodes interrelated psychological traits as nodes within explicitly constructed causal graphs, derived from DSM-5 maladaptive personality and social support constructs. \n\nConcretely, the architecture operates as follows: \n\n1) Causal Graph Construction & Encoding: We build directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) representing clinically validated causal influences among psychological traits. Each node corresponds to a latent trait embedding parameterized as a vector. We employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that propagate information along causal edges using attention-weighted message passing, ensuring embeddings capture hierarchical causal dependencies. This GNN encodes causal consistency by construction.\n\n2) Integration with LLMs: The CGPE layer is integrated upstream of the LLM's transformer layers as a conditioning mechanism. Specifically, the causal trait embeddings are combined with standard token embeddings via learned gating functions, injecting causally structured personality signals.\n\n3) Causal Alignment during Fine-tuning: Fine-tuning employs a multitask objective combining standard language modeling loss with causal alignment losses. We utilize differentiable causal inference techniques—such as structural causal model (SCM) consistency losses and intervention-based regularization—where synthetic interventions on trait embeddings must produce logically consistent semantic changes in LLM outputs aligned with psychological theory.\n\n4) Application to AI Agents: We extend this framework into interactive social AI agents (e.g., multi-agent dialog systems and robot learning platforms). The causal personality embeddings dynamically modulate agent policy networks and response generation modules, enabling behavior adaptation in embodied or social interaction scenarios.\n\nWe provide algorithmic descriptions and architectural diagrams in supplementary materials demonstrating the precise flow of causal information from psychological causal graphs through embedding computation into LLM conditioning and agent policy modulation, ensuring replicability and scientific rigor.\n\nThis structured approach surpasses prior work which lacked explicit causal embedding operationalization or integration with interactive AI agents, thereby elevating both the novelty and practical impact of our framework.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Curation: Collect and curate multi-source data embedding DSM-5 maladaptive traits, social support metrics, and agent interaction logs.\n2) Causal Graph Formalization: Collaborate with clinical psychologists to build validated causal DAGs representing psychological trait interrelations.\n3) CGPE Development: Implement GNN-based causal embedding modules with explicit message passing along causal edges.\n4) LLM Integration & Fine-tuning: Integrate CGPE into pre-trained LLMs (e.g., GPT variants); train with combined language and causal consistency objectives.\n5) AI Agent Extension: Integrate causal embeddings into multi-agent dialog systems and robot learning architectures to condition behavior policies.\n6) Evaluation: Benchmark on standard personality metrics (Big Five, DSM-5-based scales), causal consistency measures, and new embodied/social interaction tasks.\n7) Expert Validation: Conduct external evaluations with clinical psychologists and AI behavior specialists to assess psychological validity and interpretability.\n8) Ablations and Robustness: Investigate causal graph perturbations, intervention experiments on embeddings, and transfer across agent domains.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: \"Simulate a socially interactive AI agent exhibiting high causal embedding activation in supportive social traits and low maladaptive impulsivity traits.\"\nExpected Output: \"The agent engages in empathetic dialogue, responds with measured turn-taking, demonstrates cooperative problem-solving, and adapts behaviors to maintain positive social rapport, indicative of resilient, adaptive personalities embedded with psychological causal grounding.\"\n\nSoftware Test: Intervention on trait embedding node for 'impulsivity' results in systematically predictable shifts in agent response latency and risk-taking language, confirming modeled causal influence tracking.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full causal embedding training is unstable or underperforms, fallback to a semi-supervised multitask approach: train auxiliary classifiers predicting DSM-5 trait proxies as regularizers alongside standard language modeling without strict causal message passing. Explore enriched datasets from broader social psychology literature to reinforce trait correlations heuristically. Additionally, we will prototype simpler causal graph approximations (e.g., sparse Bayesian networks) and incremental integration with limited AI agent conditioning to maintain feasibility while preserving interpretability goals."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines integrating causal embeddings derived from DSM-5 maladaptive personality constructs combined with social support mechanisms into LLMs, aiming for deep interpretability via causal psychological pathways. However, the causal reasoning mechanism lacks clear operationalization details: how causal graphs concretely influence embedding learning and LLM response conditioning remains underspecified. Clarify the precise architecture, e.g., how embeddings encode and transmit causal relations, how causal alignment is enforced during fine-tuning, and which causal inference techniques are employed to ensure modeled interpretability beyond correlation. Such clarity is critical to validating soundness and replicability of the proposed causal modeling approach in language models, which is complex and nontrivial here due to the interplay of psychometrics and language generation models. Providing architectural diagrams or algorithmic descriptions would strengthen the methodological foundation substantially, ensuring the proposal’s soundness and scientific contribution can be appreciated fully by reviewers and domain experts alike. This is especially important given the known challenges in causal representation learning and interpretability in large-scale neural models of language, which require rigorous formalism beyond conceptual statements alone.  Without this transparency, the core claim of causal psychological interpretability risks seeming aspirational rather than convincingly feasible and sound in the current ML research landscape. Please elaborate accordingly in the Proposed_Method section to bolster the submission’s scientific robustness and credibility in this complex interdisciplinary space.  \n\n-- Summary: Enhance Proposed_Method with precise architectural and algorithmic details that concretely show how psychological causality is embedded and integrated within the LLM, to substantiate soundness and mechanistic reasoning of the causal embedding approach beyond conceptual framing."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and the globally-linked concepts such as 'AI agents', 'robot learning', and 'intelligent information technology', the proposal can significantly amplify impact and novelty by extending the psychological causality embedding framework beyond benchmarking into interactive AI agent systems. Specifically, integrate the causal personality embeddings into agent architectures for downstream social interaction tasks or embodied robot learning scenarios. For instance, enabling socially-aware AI agents or robots to adapt their behaviors based on psychologically valid, causally grounded personality trait embeddings would demonstrate tangible applied value and broaden scientific relevance. This extension would connect the causal personality modeling with cutting-edge AI agent research, increasing novelty by bridging symbolic causal reasoning, psychometrics, and interactive intelligent system design. It also opens pathways for cross-domain datasets and evaluation benchmarks, strengthening the empirical footing and appeal to a wider community. Suggest incorporating explicit plans or at least conceptual experiments involving AI agents or robotic systems employing the causal personality embeddings, either in multi-agent conversational settings or embodied socially interactive scenarios leveraging causal trait conditioning to dynamically modulate agent behaviors. This strategy would boost the overall contribution's resonance significantly with contemporary trends in AI research and capitalizes on the globally-linked concepts provided."
