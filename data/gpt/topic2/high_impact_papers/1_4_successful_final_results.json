    "title": "Adaptive Personality Disorder-Informed Data Augmentation for Scientific LLM Training",
    "Problem_Statement": "Scientific LLM training data lacks diversity in personality-driven communication styles informed by maladaptive and normative psychology, limiting model robustness and representation.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external hidden bridge gap by embedding psychologically valid personality disorder constructs into data augmentation, enriching personality diversity in training corpora (Opportunity 1). This leads to better synthetic personality validity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive data augmentation framework that uses controllable text generation conditioned on DSM-5-based personality disorder profiles and social support contexts to produce enriched training samples. These synthetic examples augment scientific and social discourse corpora, enabling LLMs to learn a wider gamut of personality-driven language behavior while preserving scientific accuracy.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate datasets with labels on personality traits and social support contexts. 2) Train small controllable generation modules conditioned on these traits. 3) Generate augmented datasets with varied personality disorder expression. 4) Retrain scientific LLMs on original + augmented data. 5) Evaluate improvements in personality profile benchmarks and social network interaction simulations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Original scientific abstract. Augmented Output: Same abstract rewritten to reflect a highly conscientious but socially anxious personality style, detectable via personality trait classification pipelines.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If augmentation quality is too low or noisy, implement human review and filtering or use reinforcement learning with human feedback to improve personality trait fidelity."

        "title": "Safeguarded Adaptive Data Augmentation Using Psychologically Valid Personality Constructs for Scientific LLM Training",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current scientific LLM training datasets lack nuanced representation of personality-driven communication styles, limiting model robustness in capturing diverse scientific discourse patterns. While personality disorder frameworks such as those in DSM-5 offer detailed psychological categorizations, their direct incorporation risks introducing pathological, biased, or non-factual language that may degrade model accuracy and credibility. This research seeks to carefully integrate psychologically valid, but non-pathological, personality trait variations—derived and adapted from DSM-5 constructs and normative psychology—into data augmentation for scientific corpora. It aims to achieve enhanced linguistic diversity and personality-driven expressiveness without compromising scientific factuality or inducing hallucinated or biased outputs, addressing inherent risks by embedding explicit safeguards and theoretical justifications.",
        "Motivation": "This work addresses the nuanced niche of enriching scientific LLM training with controlled personality diversity that enhances external validity and communication robustness, surpassing existing augmentation approaches that overlook personality-driven discourse variability. By methodologically adapting DSM-5 personality disorder concepts into calibrated, non-pathological personality profiles and integrating social support contexts informed by international clinical standards, including insights from University Clinics of Kinshasa, this approach infuses scientifically sound personality diversity. Unlike prior generic augmentation, the method includes domain-specific constraints and risk mitigations to preserve scientific accuracy, marking a novel, safeguarded strategy in intelligent computing techniques for scientific NLP. This novelty counters the NOV-COMPETITIVE verdict by emphasizing psychological validity combined with rigorous factual integrity and clinical grounding.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an adaptive augmentation framework integrating psychologically valid, non-pathological personality trait profiles systematically derived from DSM-5 personality disorder spectra and normative trait continuums, filtered and refined through collaboration with clinical experts from international entities such as University Clinics of Kinshasa and nutrition science communicators at the International Union of Nutritional Sciences. Controlled text generation modules will be trained to condition on these calibrated personality and social support profiles while employing robust factuality-preserving constraints and abstention mechanisms to prevent hallucinations or pathological language patterns. Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and automated consistency verification pipelines will act as safeguards, dynamically improving augmentation fidelity and scientific accuracy during training. The method leverages intelligent computing techniques to balance personality-driven linguistic diversity with strict domain reliability, delivering augmented datasets that enhance both model expressiveness and credibility in scientific contexts.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble scientific text corpora enriched with proxy personality indicators via psycholinguistic feature extraction and collaborate with clinical psychologists to label and validate trait proxies based on normative adaptations of DSM-5 constructs. 2) Design controlled text generation modules using transformer architectures trained on these trait-labeled subsets, implementing factuality-preserving constraints and domain-specific vocabulary filtering. 3) Generate augmented datasets via personality-conditioned rewriting, incorporating social support and communicative context variations informed by cross-disciplinary clinical standards. 4) Retrain scientific LLMs with combined original and augmented datasets. 5) Evaluate on multiple fronts: personality trait classification accuracy using existing benchmarks, downstream scientific NLP tasks (e.g., fact extraction, summarization, citation prediction) for knowledge retention and factual correctness, and adversarial testing for hallucination detection. 6) Integrate RLHF cycles and automated filtering early, monitored via metrics like factuality scores, perplexity, and bias indices to preempt quality degradation. 7) Document datasets and protocols thoroughly to enhance reproducibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A biomedical research abstract on nutritional interventions. Augmented Output: The abstract rewritten to reflect a highly conscientious yet socially anxious communication style that retains all factual information, verified via domain experts and detected by personality trait classifiers as showing increased social withdrawal markers without loss of scientific content or introduction of hallucinated data. Additional example: A clinical trial summary augmented to reflect an extroverted, supportive communication tone derived from normative social support profiles, consistent with ethical scientific communication norms.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If augmentation introduces unacceptable noise or factuality degradation despite safeguards, fallback includes enhanced human-in-the-loop review leveraging expert annotators from international clinical networks, combined with targeted RLHF to iteratively refine personality-conditioned generation modules. Alternative approaches include constraining augmentation to less sensitive sections of scientific texts (e.g., introductions or discussion) where personality-driven stylistic variations are less likely to harm factual integrity. Additionally, we will explore hybrid augmentation by mixing automatically generated content with controlled synthetic templates manually vetted by domain experts to ensure safety and credibility."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that integrating DSM-5-based personality disorder constructs into scientific LLM training data will substantially improve model robustness and representation needs stronger empirical or theoretical justification. It is unclear how maladaptive personality traits, typically pathological, can be incorporated without introducing bias or reducing scientific accuracy. Clarify how the method ensures personality-driven language diversity without conflating pathological communication with rational scientific discourse, and address risks of embedding maladaptive language patterns in scientific data augmentation that might harm model performance or credibility (e.g., hallucinations or reduced factuality). A more detailed justification and potential safeguards are required here to strengthen soundness of this assumption, especially given the delicate nature of personality disorders and model behavior in scientific settings. This should be added in the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections for clearer grounding and risk mitigation strategies.  "

          "feedback_content": "The experiment plan outlines a stepwise approach but lacks critical methodological details and risk controls that impact feasibility. For instance, how will personality disorder labels be reliably obtained or validated for scientific text corpora, which likely lack such annotations? Training controllable generation modules on limited and possibly noisy trait labels requires detailed dataset descriptions and robustness checks. Additionally, the plan needs concrete evaluation metrics and baselines for assessing improvements not only in personality profile benchmarks but also in downstream scientific LLM tasks (e.g., factual accuracy, domain knowledge retention). The fallback plan to use human review and RLHF is valuable, but a more anticipatory approach to augmentation noise and fidelity challenges is needed early on. Provide more explicit datasets, controls, and evaluation criteria in the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan to enhance practicality and reproducibility."
