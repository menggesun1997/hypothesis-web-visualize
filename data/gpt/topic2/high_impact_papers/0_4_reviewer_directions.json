    "title": "Behavioral-Adaptive Explanation Interfaces for Enhancing User Trust in Conversational AI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Most explanation interfaces for language models provide static explanations failing to adapt dynamically to user behavior or cognitive state, restricting their effectiveness in building user trust.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses lack of user behavior integration and dynamic interpretability assessments highlighted in both internal and external gaps. Inspired by psychology and communication research, it proposes behavior-adaptive interfaces to tailor explanations in real time.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive explanation interface that monitors user engagement signals (e.g., interaction patterns, response latency) to modulate explanation granularity and style. It includes reinforcement learning to optimize explanations that maximize trust and comprehension per user.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build prototype explanation interface integrated with chatbot backend. 2) Collect interaction data capturing behavioral signals. 3) Implement reinforcement learning algorithms for explanation policy optimization. 4) Compare user trust and satisfaction across static vs adaptive explanation conditions.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User shows confusion by repeated clarifications. Output: Interface switches to more elaborate and example-driven explanations automatically. Expected: Increased user trust and reduced repeated queries.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If behavior signals are noisy, fallback to heuristic-based adaptation rules. Also consider post-interaction surveys to refine policies."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed method conceptually aims to use reinforcement learning to optimize explanation policies based on user engagement signals, the proposal lacks clarity on how these signals will be reliably captured, quantified, and integrated into the learning algorithm. It would benefit from a more explicit description of the feature engineering pipeline, the state and action spaces for reinforcement learning, and how trust and comprehension will be operationalized as rewards. Without clarifying these, the mechanism risks being underspecified, which could limit reproducibility and hinder evaluation of soundness. Consider detailing signal preprocessing, model architecture, and reward design to strengthen methodological clarity and rigor.  \n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"

For example, incorporating techniques from 'multimodal transformer' architectures or leveraging 'deep Q-network' models could enrich the reinforcement learning framework. Additionally, linking to 'technological transparency' theories or 'determinants of users’ intention' from technology acceptance models could provide a structured framework for measuring and interpreting trust and user engagement. Embedding such interdisciplinary elements could increase the work's theoretical depth and practical relevance, positioning it more competitively in the landscape of adaptive explanation interfaces.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
