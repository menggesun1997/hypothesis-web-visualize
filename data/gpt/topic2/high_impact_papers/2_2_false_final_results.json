    "title": "Integrating Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Semantics into Scientific Language Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Language models inadequately reflect organizational values and communication workflows like CSR strategies when generating multilingual scientific content, limiting practical deployment in IT industry digital transformation contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the external gap linking IT industry concepts such as CSR with language model adaptation, as highlighted in the research landscape's second opportunity. This cross-disciplinary approach is novel and underexplored, potentially enhancing practical utility and ethical alignment in organizational contexts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a multi-layered language modeling framework that incorporates CSR semantic embeddings from industry communication datasets as an auxiliary conditioning signal during text generation, combined with supply chain performance textual data for contextual grounding. This conditioning will allow models to tailor scientific communication outputs to align with organizational CSR goals and compliance requirements across languages.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multilingual corporate communication datasets focusing on CSR and supply chain reports. 2. Extract semantic embeddings representing organizational values and link them to scientific corpora. 3. Train models jointly on scientific and CSR-aligned corpora with auxiliary conditioning. 4. Benchmark alignment with CSR principles and organization-specific communication standards through expert evaluation and automated metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Generate a multilingual report integrating recent AI ethics scientific findings tailored for a corporate audience emphasizing CSR commitments. Output: A report that explicitly aligns scientific explanations with CSR-relevant topics such as fairness and transparency, customized for the reader's language and organizational culture.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If CSR embeddings override scientific content quality, introduce gating mechanisms to balance factual precision with CSR alignment or design multi-objective optimization during training to harmonize competing objectives."
