The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'GPT-4 Technical Report', 'abstract': \"We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can\\naccept image and text inputs and produce text outputs.

    "current_research_landscape": "The core focus of this research cluster centers on advancing large-scale, multimodal language models capable of human-level performance in processing and generating text inputs and outputs, particularly across academic and professional benchmarks. The central problem being tackled is how to utilize advanced generative neural network methods to improve scientific communication, especially within the information technology industry undergoing digital transformation. Dominant methods feature Transformer-based generative models such as GPT-4, multimodal learning frameworks integrating text and images, and neural net methods that include recognition and generative models. Thematic islands bifurcate into: (1) multimodal models and their evaluation on academic benchmarks, (2) neural net methods including generative and recognition models explored in contexts like Facebook research and hardware approaches, and (3) the organizational and societal transformation mediated by information technology and digitalization. Collectively, these reveal a landscape combining cutting-edge AI techniques with applied domain challenges in communication, ethics, and digital transformation.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Foundational papers emphasize limitations related to biases inherent in training datasets, ethical and legal concerns of generative AI deployment, and challenges in verifying accuracy and trustworthiness of AI-generated text. The bridge nodes ('neural net method' and 'Facebook research') suggest underexplored connective opportunities between algorithmic advances and real-world application contexts, highlighting a gap in seamlessly integrating technical innovations with organizational and societal transformation needs. Furthermore, despite breakthroughs in multimodal capabilities, the nuanced adaptation of these models to diverse multilingual scientific communication scenarios remains under-addressed, with sparse exploration of cultural, linguistic, and ethical considerations tailored to such contexts. \n\nExternal/Novel Gaps: The GPS analysis reveals strong latent connections between multimodal models and neural net methods within machine learning and human-centered computing, yet these are not fully tapped to address challenges in multilingual scientific communication. For instance, concepts like deep learning-based feature engineering, multimodal brain tumor segmentation, and graph neural networks provide advanced methodologies that have not been explicitly connected to enhancing language models for multilingual science communication. Additionally, intersections of multimodal modeling with information technology industry insights (e.g., corporate social responsibility communication strategies and supply chain performance measurement) suggest that integrating business and social science approaches with AI methods is an overlooked frontier. Leveraging these hidden bridges could enable development of context-aware, culturally sensitive adaptive language models that better address communication efficacy and ethical issues in global scientific communities.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate advanced multimodal deep learning frameworks (including graph neural networks and channel attention modules from the global co-concept space) with current generative models (B2's multimodal cluster) to create robust, contextually aware AI that enhances multilingual scientific text generation and comprehension, addressing internal gaps around accuracy, cultural adaptation, and multimodal context under-exploration.\n\nOpportunity 2: Apply insights from information technology industry concepts such as corporate social responsibility communication strategies and supply chain management to design adaptive language models that better align with organizational digital transformation needs (B2's organizational cluster). This cross-disciplinary fusion can fill gaps related to practical deployment challenges, ethical considerations, and alignment with business communication workflows.\n\nOpportunity 3: Leverage the bridge between neural net methods and Facebook research to develop ethical, transparent alignment techniques for generative models in multilingual settings, incorporating reinforcement learning from human feedback and sociocultural input. This can address known limitations around bias, transparency, and legal-ethical compliance highlighted in foundational works (Part A)."
