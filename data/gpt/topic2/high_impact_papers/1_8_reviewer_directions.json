    "title": "Multi-Agent Social-Personality Interaction Dataset for Scientific LLM Benchmarking",
    "Problem_Statement": "A lack of realistic, large-scale datasets simulating multi-agent social interactions with embedded personality profiles limits integrated benchmarking of LLMs.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses critical internal gap about bridging social network methods with personality measures and enables Opportunity 2 regarding enriched multi-dimensional benchmarking datasets.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct an annotated corpus of synthetic multi-agent dialogues where each agent is parameterized with validated DSM-5-based personality profiles and social network roles. Incorporate dynamic interaction patterns reflecting social support and maladaptive traits. The dataset captures nuanced language and network evolution over time for benchmarking scientific LLM behavior.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Generate multi-agent dialogues via controlled LLM prompting. 2) Annotate or assign personality and social network metadata to agents. 3) Validate dataset with human expert rating on psychological realism. 4) Release dataset publicly for benchmarking use. 5) Utilize dataset to benchmark LLMs on integrated social-personality tasks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Simulate a scientific committee discussion with members exhibiting a range of personality traits. Output: Annotated transcript with agent personality and network role labels and emergent social network graph.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If synthetic dialogues lack realism, incorporate human-in-the-loop corrections or hybrid real-synthetic datasets combining human and LLM outputs."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines constructing synthetic multi-agent dialogues parameterized by DSM-5 personality profiles and social network roles with dynamic interaction patterns. However, it lacks clarity on how exactly the personality and social network parameters concretely influence dialogue generation in a controlled and reproducible manner. For example, it is unclear what models or algorithms govern the evolving social network roles and maladaptive trait expressions during conversations, or how these are integrated with the language model prompting. To strengthen the mechanism, the proposal should specify the computational framework and protocols for embedding these psychological and social dynamics into multi-agent interactions, ensuring both psychological fidelity and linguistic diversity that realistically reflect social support and maladaptive behaviors over time. This clarity is essential for scientific validity and reproducibility of the dataset construction process, as well as for interpreting downstream benchmarking results effectively. Please elaborate on these mechanistic details with concrete formalisms or algorithmic steps, possibly supported by prior work or pilot experiments if available."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the current scope, integrating knowledge or methodologies from the globally-linked concept of 'counseling services' could substantially enhance both impact and novelty. Specifically, incorporating data or theoretical frameworks from counseling psychology could provide enriched, clinically-validated personality interaction scenarios emphasizing practical psychological dynamics such as therapeutic alliance development, conflict resolution, or maladaptive behavior patterns often addressed in counseling. This would facilitate benchmarking LLMs on socially and clinically meaningful tasks beyond synthetic discourse simulation, advancing towards applications with societal and mental health relevance. Furthermore, collaboration with professionals in counseling services for expert annotations or scenario validation can increase dataset authenticity and broaden its use cases. This integration would differentiate the dataset from existing multi-agent benchmarks and build bridges between AI language modeling and applied psychological science, making the work more impactful and novel."
