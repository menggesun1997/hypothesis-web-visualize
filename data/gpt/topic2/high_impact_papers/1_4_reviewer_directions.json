    "title": "Adaptive Personality Disorder-Informed Data Augmentation for Scientific LLM Training",
    "Problem_Statement": "Scientific LLM training data lacks diversity in personality-driven communication styles informed by maladaptive and normative psychology, limiting model robustness and representation.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external hidden bridge gap by embedding psychologically valid personality disorder constructs into data augmentation, enriching personality diversity in training corpora (Opportunity 1). This leads to better synthetic personality validity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive data augmentation framework that uses controllable text generation conditioned on DSM-5-based personality disorder profiles and social support contexts to produce enriched training samples. These synthetic examples augment scientific and social discourse corpora, enabling LLMs to learn a wider gamut of personality-driven language behavior while preserving scientific accuracy.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate datasets with labels on personality traits and social support contexts. 2) Train small controllable generation modules conditioned on these traits. 3) Generate augmented datasets with varied personality disorder expression. 4) Retrain scientific LLMs on original + augmented data. 5) Evaluate improvements in personality profile benchmarks and social network interaction simulations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Original scientific abstract. Augmented Output: Same abstract rewritten to reflect a highly conscientious but socially anxious personality style, detectable via personality trait classification pipelines.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If augmentation quality is too low or noisy, implement human review and filtering or use reinforcement learning with human feedback to improve personality trait fidelity."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that integrating DSM-5-based personality disorder constructs into scientific LLM training data will substantially improve model robustness and representation needs stronger empirical or theoretical justification. It is unclear how maladaptive personality traits, typically pathological, can be incorporated without introducing bias or reducing scientific accuracy. Clarify how the method ensures personality-driven language diversity without conflating pathological communication with rational scientific discourse, and address risks of embedding maladaptive language patterns in scientific data augmentation that might harm model performance or credibility (e.g., hallucinations or reduced factuality). A more detailed justification and potential safeguards are required here to strengthen soundness of this assumption, especially given the delicate nature of personality disorders and model behavior in scientific settings. This should be added in the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections for clearer grounding and risk mitigation strategies. Â "

          "feedback_content": "The experiment plan outlines a stepwise approach but lacks critical methodological details and risk controls that impact feasibility. For instance, how will personality disorder labels be reliably obtained or validated for scientific text corpora, which likely lack such annotations? Training controllable generation modules on limited and possibly noisy trait labels requires detailed dataset descriptions and robustness checks. Additionally, the plan needs concrete evaluation metrics and baselines for assessing improvements not only in personality profile benchmarks but also in downstream scientific LLM tasks (e.g., factual accuracy, domain knowledge retention). The fallback plan to use human review and RLHF is valuable, but a more anticipatory approach to augmentation noise and fidelity challenges is needed early on. Provide more explicit datasets, controls, and evaluation criteria in the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan to enhance practicality and reproducibility."
