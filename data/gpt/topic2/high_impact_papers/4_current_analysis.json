The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Self-Organizing Maps', 'abstract': 'The Self-Organizing Map (SOM), with its variants, is the most popular artificial neural network algorithm in the unsupervised learning category. About 4000 research articles on it have appeared in the open literature, and many industrial projects use the SOM as a tool for solving hard real-world problems. Many fields of science have adopted the SOM as a standard analytical tool: in statistics, signal processing, control theory, financial analyses, experimental physics, chemistry and medicine. The SOM solves difficult high-dimensional and nonlinear problems such as feature extraction and classification of images and acoustic patterns, adaptive control of robots, and equalization, demodulation, and error-tolerant transmission of signals in telecommunications. A new area is organization of very large document collections. Last but not least, it may be mentioned that the SOM is one of the most realistic models of the biological brain function. This new edition includes a survey of over 2000 contemporary studies to cover the newest results; case examples were provided with detailed formulae, illustrations, and tables; a new chapter on Software Tools for SOM was written, other chapters were extended or reorganized.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Knowing Capitalism', 'abstract': '`This is an ambitious, original, and complex treatment of key aspects of contemporary capitalism. It makes a major contribution because it profoundly destabilizes the scholarship on globalization, the so-called new economy, information technology, distinct contemporary business cultures and practices\\' - Saskia Sassen, author of Globalization and its Discontents `Nigel Thrift offers us the sort of cultural analysis of global capitalism that has long been needed - one that emphasizes the innovative energy of global capitalism. The book avoids stale denouncements and offers instead a view of capitalism as a form of practice\\' - Karin Knorr Cetina, Professor of Sociology, University of Konstanz, GermanyCapitalism is well known for producing a form of existence where `everything solid melts into air\\'. But what happens when capitalism develops theories about itself? Are we moving into a condition in which capitalism can be said to possess a brain?These questions are pursued in this sparkling and thought-provoking book. Thrift looks at what he calls \"the cultural circuit of capitalism,\" the mechanism for generating new theories of capitalism. The book traces the rise of this circuit back to the 1960s when a series of institutions locked together to interrogate capitalism, to the present day, when these institutions are moving out to the Pacific basin and beyond. What have these theories produced? How have they been implicated in the speculative bubbles that characterized the late twentieth century? What part have they played in developing our understanding of human relations?Building on an inter-disciplinary approach which embraces the core social sciences, Thrift outlines an exciting new theory for understanding capitalism. His book is of interest to readers in Geography, Social Theory, Antrhopology and Cultural Economics.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Handbook of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles', 'abstract': 'The Handbook of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is a reference text for the academic and research communities, industry, manufacturers, users, practitioners, Federal Government, Federal and State Agencies, the private sector, as well as all organizations that are and will be using unmanned aircraft in a wide spectrum of applications.

The uncertainty that surrounds the future is both exciting and challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise risks and maximise utilities. The large number of forecasting applications calls for a diverse set of forecasting methods to tackle real-life challenges. This article provides a non-systematic review of the theory and the practice of forecasting. We provide an overview of a wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles, and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety of real-life contexts. We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and applications. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of forecasting theory and practice. Given its encyclopedic nature, the intended mode of reading is non-linear. We offer cross-references to allow the readers to navigate through the various topics.

    "title": "Landscape Map of Investigating the Role of Language Models in Modeling Human Concept Formation",
    "current_research_landscape": "The central focus of this research cluster is understanding and modeling complex socio-technical phenomena, particularly the facets of global capitalism, digital transformation of organizations, and information technologies including UAV systems as rich sources of data and complexity. Core concepts like 'global capitalism', 'core social sciences', and 'digital transformation of organisations' indicate that the cluster is rooted in socio-economic and organizational theory contexts, aiming to capture human conceptualization of large-scale, high-dimensional real-world systems. Thematic islands cluster around social sciences and cultural theories of capitalism, technological artifacts (unmanned aerial vehicles and architectures), and computational modeling paradigms, including the use of state-of-the-art models and open-source implementations. Dominant methods involve interdisciplinary approaches blending social theory, advanced computational methods (e.g., neural networks, unsupervised learning like Self-Organizing Maps), and system-level analyses to model behaviors, organizational transformations, and information flows. Foundational papers underscore a breadth of perspectives — from AI ethics and societal disruptions to forecasting, fuzzy set theory, and neuroscience — providing diverse theoretical and methodological backgrounds relevant for modeling human concept formation in complex domains.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: The curated papers reveal a paucity of integrative frameworks directly linking computational models (e.g., state-of-the-art neural and fuzzy systems) with rich, nuanced socio-cultural theories such as those in core social sciences. The local knowledge skeleton shows no bridge nodes, indicating compartmentalization between social science concepts and technological systems modeling. This siloing limits understanding of how language models can capture or simulate human conceptualization embedded in socio-cultural practices. Also, there is a lack of attention to capturing or integrating ethical, legal, and epistemic challenges of AI-generated knowledge within conceptual modeling frameworks. External/Novel Gaps: The global GPS analysis suggests underexplored cross-disciplinary connections, notably between 'core social sciences' and 'volume of information', as well as between 'information technology industry' and 'state-of-the-art models'. For instance, the prominence of concepts like 'default mode network' and 'self-referential processing' (neuroscience/psychology) linked with social sciences and information volume hints at opportunities to incorporate cognitive neuroscience insights into modeling human concept formation. Similarly, bridging fuzzy set theory and qualitative analyses with industry-level digital transformation models could advance interpretability and contextual grounding of AI-generated concepts. These hidden bridges suggest fertile grounds for integrating cognitive, social, and computational perspectives to enrich language models' capacity to model human conceptual frameworks authentically and ethically.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate cognitive neuroscience constructs such as 'default mode network' and 'self-referential processing' (from Global Context C) with the modeling paradigms used in state-of-the-art machine learning models (Local Theme B2: 'state-of-the-art models') to enhance language models’ ability to simulate human concept formation processes. This addresses internal gaps related to insufficient cognitive grounding.\n\nOpportunity 2: Combine fuzzy set theory and qualitative comparative analyses (from Global GPS bridges) with digital transformation frameworks (Local Theme B2: 'digital transformation of organisations') to develop interpretable AI systems that can better model ambiguous, context-dependent human concepts in organizational settings. This tackles the internal siloing between social science theories and computational models.\n\nOpportunity 3: Leverage advances in open-source implementations of sophisticated forecasting and information volume management techniques (Local Theme B2) together with ethical and legal frameworks highlighted in AI ethics discussions (from foundational paper 1) to develop transparent, accountable language model systems that can be trusted for modeling human conceptual dynamics in socio-technical systems. This targets the gap in ethical and epistemic considerations implicit in current research."
