ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, has been trained using massive amounts of data and simulates human conversation by comprehending context and generating appropriate responses. It has garnered significant attention due to its ability to effectively answer a broad range of human inquiries, with fluent and comprehensive answers surpassing prior public chatbots in both security and usefulness. However, a comprehensive analysis of ChatGPT’s failures is lacking, which is the focus of this study. Eleven categories of failures, including reasoning, factual errors, math, coding, and bias, are presented and discussed. The risks, limitations, and societal implications of ChatGPT are also highlighted. The goal of this study is to assist researchers and developers in enhancing future language models and chatbots.

Usually, it is essential to understand the reasoning behind an AI model’s decision-making. Thus, the need for eXplainable AI (XAI) methods for improving trust in AI models has arisen. XAI has become a popular research subject within the AI field in recent years. Existing survey papers have tackled the concepts of XAI, its general terms, and post-hoc explainability methods but there have not been any reviews that have looked at the assessment methods, available tools, XAI datasets, and other related aspects. Therefore, in this comprehensive study, we provide readers with an overview of the current research and trends in this rapidly emerging area with a case study example. The study starts by explaining the background of XAI, common definitions, and summarizing recently proposed techniques in XAI for supervised machine learning. The review divides XAI techniques into four axes using a hierarchical categorization system: (i) data explainability, (ii) model explainability, (iii) post-hoc explainability, and (iv) assessment of explanations. We also introduce available evaluation metrics as well as open-source packages and datasets with future research directions. Then, the significance of explainability in terms of legal demands, user viewpoints, and application orientation is outlined, termed as XAI concerns. This paper advocates for tailoring explanation content to specific user types. An examination of XAI techniques and evaluation was conducted by looking at 410 critical articles, published between January 2016 and October 2022, in reputed journals and using a wide range of research databases as a source of information. The article is aimed at XAI researchers who are interested in making their AI models more trustworthy, as well as towards researchers from other disciplines who are looking for effective XAI methods to complete tasks with confidence while communicating meaning from data.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'The SAGE Encyclopedia of Educational Research, Measurement, and Evaluation', 'abstract': 'In an era of curricular changes and experiments and high-stakes testing, educational measurement and evaluation is more important than ever.

However, attaining truly trustworthy AI concerns a wider vision that comprises the trustworthiness of all processes and actors that are part of the system’s life cycle, and considers previous aspects from different lenses. A more holistic vision contemplates four essential axes: the global principles for ethical use and development of AI-based systems, a philosophical take on AI ethics, a risk-based approach to AI regulation, and the mentioned pillars and requirements. The seven requirements (human agency and oversight; robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental wellbeing; and accountability) are analyzed from a triple perspective: What each requirement for trustworthy AI is, Why it is needed, and How each requirement can be implemented in practice. On the other hand, a practical approach to implement trustworthy AI systems allows defining the concept of responsibility of AI-based systems facing the law, through a given auditing process. Therefore, a responsible AI system is the resulting notion we introduce in this work, and a concept of utmost necessity that can be realized through auditing processes, subject to the challenges posed by the use of regulatory sandboxes. Our multidisciplinary vision of trustworthy AI culminates in a debate on the diverging views published lately about the future of AI. Our reflections in this matter conclude that regulation is a key for reaching a consensus among these views, and that trustworthy and responsible AI systems will be crucial for the present and future of our society.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "title": "Research Landscape Map: Evaluating Language Model Interpretability for Cognitive Science Insights",
    "current_research_landscape": "The core focus of this research cluster centers on understanding and evaluating language models, particularly conversational agents like ChatGPT, within the context of communication and media studies. The central problem is to interpret the reasoning and decision-making processes of advanced language models to gain cognitive science insights and improve their interaction with human communication systems. Thematic islands reveal two main subfields: (1) communication research and media studies focusing on multi-media environments, and (2) chatbot technologies and large-scale language modeling involving human conversation and massive data training paradigms. Dominant methodologies draw from communication research traditions employing mixed methods for studying media environments, combined with AI explainability (XAI) techniques and post-hoc interpretability assessments aimed at opening the 'black box' of language models. There is also a strong emphasis on evaluating failures (e.g., reasoning errors, biases) to guide improvements and build user trust, positioning evaluation and assessment tools as crucial.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite extensive work on XAI and explanatory methods for AI models, existing foundational research lacks comprehensive, domain-adapted interpretable frameworks tailored specifically for language models in conversational contexts. The bridge node 'language model' indicates that there is insufficient integration between communication research methodologies and AI interpretability approaches, which hinders a cohesive understanding of how language models process and generate human-like dialogue. Moreover, current assessment methods often fail to capture the nuanced cognitive processes involved, especially related to multi-modal communication in media environments. External/Novel Gaps: The global context reveals a hidden bridge between 'communication research' and 'chatbot' concepts within the psychology and biomedical sciences domains, particularly relating to 'technology trust', 'user behavior', and 'healthcare chatbots.' This interdisciplinary connection remains underexplored in the reviewed literature, suggesting an opportunity to integrate psychological insights on user trust, decision-making, and user interaction patterns with communication research frameworks to better evaluate and design interpretable language models. This would address gaps in understanding human cognitive responses and trust dynamics towards conversational AI, which is critical for cognitive science insights.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate psychological constructs of technology trust and user decision-making processes from the biomedical/psychology domain (Global Hidden Bridge) with communication research frameworks studying multi-media environments (Local Thematic Island 1) to develop richer interpretability metrics and explanatory interfaces for language models. This addresses the internal gap of lacking user-centric interpretability assessment in conversational AI.\n\nOpportunity 2: Develop hybrid evaluation methodologies combining communication research methods (e.g., discourse analysis, scenario-based experiments) with advanced XAI techniques (as reviewed in the AI explainability survey) to systematically map and interpret failure modes of language models like ChatGPT. Such integration leverages the central 'language model' bridge node to overcome the internal gap around insufficient domain-specific interpretability approaches.\n\nOpportunity 3: Employ insights from cognitive psychology and biomedical informatics, focusing on user interactions with healthcare chatbots (Global Context Cluster), to create domain-specific interpretability frameworks for language models in sensitive contexts. This cross-disciplinary approach addresses both performance and trust evaluation gaps, enhancing the cognitive science relevance of interpretability evaluations for real-world applications involving human users' well-being and decision-making."
