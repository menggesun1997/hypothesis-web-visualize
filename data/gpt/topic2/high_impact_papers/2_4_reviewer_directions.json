    "title": "Supply Chain-Aware Adaptive Language Models for Scientific Communication",
    "Problem_Statement": "Scientific language models currently do not dynamically adapt content to reflect complexities and constraints of supply chain performance, especially in multilingual communication relevant to IT industry transformations.",
    "Motivation": "Fills an external gap by incorporating supply chain performance measurement insights into adaptive language models to contextualize scientific communication, a novel cross-disciplinary innovation opportunity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build an adaptive language model conditioned on supply chain state embeddings derived from real-time and historical supply chain textual and structured data. The model dynamically adjusts scientific explanations, complexity, and emphasis based on the supply chain context, supporting multilingual outputs sensitive to organizational and operational realities.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multilingual datasets linking supply chain reports with scientific communication in IT contexts. 2. Encode supply chain state indicators as embeddings. 3. Train adaptive conditional language models. 4. Evaluate adaptability via human expert ratings on relevance and clarity under different supply chain scenarios.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Scientific explanation of blockchain technology impacts, conditioned on a supply chain experiencing high disruption, in German. Output: A tailored explanation prioritizing relevance to supply chain resilience and disruption mitigation strategies, linguistically fluent and contextually grounded.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If conditioning on supply chain data proves challenging, implement a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline where supply chain data is used to fetch relevant context that guides generation instead of direct conditioning."
