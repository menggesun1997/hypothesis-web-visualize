    "title": "CognitiveTrust Framework: Interpretable Language Models for Healthcare Chatbots",
    "Problem_Statement": "Healthcare chatbots require interpretable models that build user trust and support informed decision-making; current frameworks do not sufficiently tailor interpretability to sensitive biomedical contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external novel gap by integrating cognitive psychology and biomedical informatics to develop domain-specific interpretability, focusing on trust and well-being in healthcare chatbot interactions. Novelty lies in specialized frameworks for sensitive contexts informed by cross-disciplinary insights.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design CognitiveTrust, an interpretability framework embedding cognitive trust models within language model explanations contextualized for healthcare. It uses transparent dialogue summarization, rationale generation aligned with medical knowledge bases, and interactive trust-aware explanation layers.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather healthcare chatbot interaction data annotated with trust and satisfaction metrics. 2) Integrate external biomedical knowledge graphs. 3) Develop multi-level explanation mechanisms (surface explanations, clinical rationale, cognitive trust signals). 4) Evaluate with patient simulators and real users on trust, comprehension, and decision support effectiveness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient asks chatbot about side effects of a complex treatment. Output: Multi-layered explanation includes simple language rationale, linked biomedical references, and confidence levels. Expected: Users demonstrate greater trust and improved adherence intentions reflecting effective interpretability.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If biomedical knowledge integration is challenging, fallback to curated FAQs with explanation templates. Alternative evaluation via expert user studies to validate explanations in absence of large datasets."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is promising but lacks detail on key operational challenges that may threaten feasibility. For instance, the plan to gather healthcare chatbot interactions annotated with trust and satisfaction metrics is not elaborated with respect to data sources, annotation methods, and scale, which are critical given the sensitive healthcare domain. Furthermore, integrating external biomedical knowledge graphs poses well-known difficulties related to knowledge base curation, alignment with language model outputs, and real-time inference constraints. The fallback plan is reasonable but seems like a reduced-scope alternative rather than a robust contingency. Strengthening the experimental plan with clearer methodologies for data collection, annotation reliability, scalability, and knowledge integration strategies will enhance overall feasibility and confidence in success. Consider including planned pilot studies or benchmarks to incrementally validate each framework component before full integration to manage risks effectively. This will also support reproducibility and practical deployment in real healthcare settings. The current plan risks underestimating these complexities, which could impede timely and effective validation and impact realization at scale and in real users' hands. Suggest adding more operational detail and risk mitigation steps in the experimental plan section to address feasibility concerns comprehensively and concretely, beyond high-level steps currently described, particularly for phases involving sensitive patient data and external knowledge integration complexities.\n\nIn summary, without detailed plans addressing these practical considerations, the feasibility of the proposed framework's full realization in the stated timeline and scope remains uncertain and should be clarified before proceeding to avoid potential resource and evaluation bottlenecks early in the project lifecycle. This will ensure the framework is not only conceptually sound but practically executable and impactful in real-world healthcare chatbot scenarios where interpretability and trustworthiness are mission-critical. See related expertise from biomedical informatics and cognitive trust modeling applied in healthcare NLP systems for concrete best practices and procedural parallels to strengthen feasibility arguments here. \n\nKey actionable suggestion: Provide detailed annotation protocols, data sources, biomedical knowledge integration methods, and phased validation steps in the Experiment_Plan section, with fallback and risk management explicitly aligned to these complexities for a more grounded and executable methodology rather than high-level conceptual steps only.\n\nThis is the top priority to address to increase confidence in the project's practical viability and ultimate impact potential on healthcare chatbot trust and interpretability enhancement targeting real end-users and clinical stakeholders. The conceptual novelty and interdisciplinary motivation are strong, but feasibility must match to unlock impact potential effectively at scale and in sensitive healthcare environments that demand rigor and precision in both data and clinical knowledge application contexts. Thank you! \n\n---\n\nSecond key critical feedback below."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposal is well-motivated to improve interpretability and trust in healthcare chatbots, the Problem_Statement and Test_Case_Examples suggest a relatively narrow scope focused on user trust and biomedical explanation layers primarily for side effects inquiries and interaction comprehension. This risks limiting the broader impact and applicability of the CognitiveTrust Framework. Healthcare chatbot use cases are multifaceted, spanning symptom triage, chronic condition management, medication adherence, mental health support, and preventive care, each with varying trust and interpretability requirements. \n\nTo maximize impact and appeal beyond a niche subdomain, the proposal should articulate how the framework could generalize or be adapted across multiple healthcare interaction scenarios and diverse patient populations. Including plans to evaluate trust and interpretability effects across a wider range of clinical contexts or healthcare user needs would broaden significance and foster cross-domain adoption. Illustrative test cases addressing more varied and complex clinical questions, decisions under uncertainty, or diverse user literacy levels would reinforce this broader relevance. \n\nAdditionally, impact could be enhanced by considering integration pathways into existing clinical workflows, electronic health records, or telehealth platforms, emphasizing translational potential into real-world healthcare ecosystem adoption. \n\nConcretely, expanding the scope in the Problem_Statement and validation plans to demonstrate versatility across medical domains and user contexts, while maintaining rigorous domain-specific interpretability, will strengthen the proposal’s potential impact. Highlighting how CognitiveTrust advances beyond existing healthcare chatbot interpretability frameworks to support diverse and critical clinical decision points or underserved patient groups will position the work as a more foundational step toward trustworthy AI agents across healthcare settings rather than a focused interpretability module for limited scenarios. \n\nThis expanded framing would correspondingly enhance the project’s significance and appeal to a broader audience of researchers, clinicians, and system developers engaged in deploying responsible and effective AI-powered healthcare conversational agents. Thus, addressing this focus narrowing is essential alongside feasibility enhancements to realize the framework’s full applied value and scholarly influence given the competitive research landscape. \n\nKey actionable suggestion: Broaden the Problem_Statement and test case examples to explicitly include multiple healthcare chatbot use cases and diverse user needs, and plan evaluations reflecting this expanded scope to showcase wider applicability and systemic impact. This will complement the interdisciplinary novelty with tangible broader significance and encourage adoption beyond a limited subdomain."
