    "title": "Default Mode Network Inspired Attention Mechanisms in Transformers",
    "Problem_Statement": "Transformer architectures lack biologically inspired attention dynamics that resemble human default mode network engagement, limiting their ability to model self-referential and introspective concept formation.",
    "Motivation": "Directly addresses the internal gap of lacking cognitive grounding by injecting neuroscience-inspired attention patterns modeled on DMN dynamics into transformer layers to enhance self-referential processing capability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an attention modulation module inspired by the functional connectivity patterns of the DMN, dynamically regulating the self-attention weights to prioritize introspective, contextually reflective information processing during language understanding and generation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Analyze DMN connectivity data to extract statistical attention patterns. 2) Implement a differentiable attention mask generator within transformer layers based on DMN patterns. 3) Train on datasets requiring self-referential inference and concept integration. 4) Evaluate improvements on human-like concept formation benchmarks and introspective reasoning tasks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Reflect on your own understanding of economic inequity.\" Expected output: Language model produces responses evidencing self-referential meta-cognition resembling human introspection.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If specific DMN pattern modeling is ineffective, fallback to learnable attention masks initialized with human cognitive bias priors or integrate reinforcement learning to tune attention dynamics for self-referential tasks."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines injecting attention modulation inspired by DMN functional connectivity but lacks explicit clarity on how these neuroscientific connectivity patterns are concretely translated into differentiable attention masks within the transformer architecture. To strengthen soundness, it is critical to detail the mapping from biological DMN dynamics to computational mechanisms, including how dynamic modulation will interact with existing attention heads, how temporal and spatial DMN features are captured, and how the method ensures stable end-to-end training without compromising transformer effectiveness. Without this, the mechanism risks being conceptually appealing yet underspecified and difficult to reproduce or validate experimentally, threatening the foundational soundness of the approach. This clarification will also guide the experiment plan more clearly and improve scientific rigor and replicability in the community context currently saturated with related methods. Therefore, I recommend the authors expand and rigorously formalize this core methodological component in the final proposal stage to concretely operationalize the DMN inspiration into transformer internals with algorithmic precision and theoretical backing, possibly backed by preliminary simulations demonstrating how DMN-based masks differ from baseline attention patterns and their impact on self-referential task performance metrics. This would make the contribution both novel and methodologically sound beyond intuitive neuroscience analogy alone, a necessary step given the competitive nature of the research area and novelty assessment outcome. The target for this detailed clarification is the 'Proposed_Method' section to ensure reviewers can clearly follow and evaluate the innovation pathway and technical feasibility from first principles onward.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE assessment and the tightly focused neuroscientific inspiration, the idea's impact and distinctiveness could be enhanced by explicitly integrating frameworks from 'models of cognition' and 'meta-learning.' Specifically, incorporating meta-learning techniques can allow the model to adaptively learn and refine DMN-inspired attention patterns across different self-referential tasks, promoting robustness and task generalization beyond static DMN pattern injection. Furthermore, framing the approach within cognitive modeling paradigms—such as simulating introspective inference processes—can provide theoretical grounding and richer interpretability, allowing the model to better mirror human-like concept formation mechanisms. Operationalizing this integration might involve designing a meta-learning training regime that tunes attention modulation parameters conditioned on task-specific introspective signals, or alternatively, embedding cognitive theory-guided constraints on attention dynamics that evolve with meta-learned objectives. This alignment will not only boost the paper's novelty but also widen its impact to cognitive science and meta-learning audiences, making it a more competitive candidate in premier venues. Suggest revising the proposal to include meta-learning driven adaptive attention modulation informed by cognitive models, framed in a way that connects biological inspiration with learnable computational paradigms. This strategic enhancement targets both the 'Proposed_Method' to enrich mechanism design and the 'Motivation' section to clarify interdisciplinary contextualization and impact breadth."
