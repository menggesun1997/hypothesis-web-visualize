    "title": "TrustLens: User-Centric Interpretability Metrics Integrating Psychological Trust Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current interpretability metrics for language models lack incorporation of user trust dynamics, especially in conversational AI interacting in multimedia environments. This limits understanding of how explanations affect user trust and decision-making.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient user-centric interpretability assessments and exploits the hidden bridge between communication research and psychology domains integrating technology trust constructs. This is novel by explicitly modeling user trust as an interpretability metric, uniting communication and psychological insights.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design and implement TrustLens, a framework that quantifies interpretability not only by model explainability features but also by measuring user trust via psychological constructs (e.g., perceived reliability, transparency). The method combines post-hoc explanation generation with user feedback collected through interactive multimedia dialogues to dynamically adapt explanations fostering trust.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect conversational data with multimedia context. 2) Build XAI explanation modules (attention visualization, causal attributions). 3) Develop surveys and experiments for users rating trust-related metrics during interaction. 4) Analyze correlations between explanations and trust scores. 5) Compare TrustLens with traditional interpretability metrics and assess impact on user trust and decision efficacy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User asks a healthcare chatbot about medication side effects with visual aids. Output: Explanations presented via textual justifications complemented by highlight overlays on multimedia content. Expected: Users report higher trust scores and better understanding via the TrustLens-adapted explanations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If user trust is hard to quantify reliably, fallback to qualitative interviews and focus groups to gather interpretability feedback. Alternatively, simulate trust via proxy behavioral metrics (e.g., continued interaction, adherence)."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a plausible approach but lacks detail on key experimental design aspects critical for feasibility. For example, collecting conversational data with multimedia contexts (Step 1) needs clearer specification on data sources, participant demographics, and the scale required to support statistically meaningful analysis. Similarly, the surveys and experiments for capturing user trust during interactions (Step 3) should be designed to minimize biases and include validated psychological scales. Clarify how dynamic adaptation of explanations will be operationalized and evaluated over sessions. Address these gaps by detailing experimental controls, recruitment criteria, sample size estimation, and precise metrics to ensure replicability and robustness of findings in real-world multimedia conversational AI settings. This will increase confidence in feasibility and scientific rigor of the evaluation plan, mitigating potential risks related to trust measurement and adaptation efficacy testing during the interaction cycles. This level of detail is essential given the complexity of integrating psychological trust constructs with AI interpretability metrics and user studies involving multimedia dialogues, which pose non-trivial logistical and methodological challenges that could hinder successful execution otherwise.  Provide technical clarity on instrument validation and data collection protocols to strengthen feasibility assessment for the reviewers and stakeholders involved in future implementation phases.  Also consider data privacy, consent, and ethical aspects given the sensitive nature of trust in healthcare/chatbot settings mentioned in test cases, to feasibly accommodate participant protections and institutional approvals essential for deployment and evaluation phases to succeed consistently across diverse user populations.  Incorporating these practical experiment design improvements will greatly enhance feasibility, mitigating potential under-specified risks in the proposal's current form, and will solidify trustworthiness and generalizability of outcome interpretations from the user-centric trust modeling framework TrustLens aims to pioneer.  Overall, expand the experimental plan with scientifically grounded, operationalized details and contingency strategies for key phases related to user studies and trust metric validation for stronger feasibility endorsement."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty rating of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the inspirational globally-linked concepts provided, consider explicitly integrating recent advances in 'automatic emotion detection' and 'speech emotion recognition' into TrustLens. This integration can enrich psychological trust modeling by incorporating real-time affective state signals alongside self-reported trust measures, providing a multimodal trust metric that captures implicit user trust cues from emotion recognition. Embedding this emotional context within multimedia conversational AI explanations can help dynamically tailor explanations not only based on user feedback but also on detected emotional states, potentially improving the accuracy and responsiveness of TrustLens’s adaptive explanations. Additionally, linking with 'human-computer interaction' and 'integration of AI technology' domains, strengthen the interdisciplinarity by collaborating with HCI experts to design intuitive interfaces that surface trust metrics transparently to users, improving engagement and usability. This cross-disciplinary enrichment would significantly broaden TrustLens’s impact and novelty by moving beyond static surveys toward real-time, context-aware, affective user-centric interpretability metrics, thereby positioning the work at the forefront of explainable AI research in socially interactive, multimodal environments such as smart healthcare chatbots. By evolving TrustLens in this direction, the framework can pioneer a new class of trust-aware AI systems that better manage nuanced human factors through sophisticated emotion and trust interplay modeling, thus addressing the competitive landscape innovatively and raising the research’s visibility and practical significance."
