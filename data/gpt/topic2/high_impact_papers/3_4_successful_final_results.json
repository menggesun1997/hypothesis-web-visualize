    "Problem_Statement": "Difficulty exists in directly mapping computationally learned mechanistic predictions to ethnographically documented cognitive phenomena in language use, limiting holistic AI interpretability.",
    "Motivation": "This project innovates by synergizing statistical contrastive modeling with ethnographic narrative interpretation, directly addressing the internal gap of lacking experimental validation and interpretability frameworks for hierarchical models tied to real-world language context.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a joint framework that aligns statistical contrastive learning-derived mechanistic features with ethnographic annotations and narratives through co-training and contrastive alignment losses. The resulting model yields aligned representations interpretable both computationally and ethnographically.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather ethnographically rich annotated corpora with detailed language use contexts. 2) Train contrastive language models with alignment objectives to ethnographic labels. 3) Validate alignment via correlation with ethnographic interpretations and performance on prediction tasks informed by ethnographic data.",

        "title": "Hybrid Statistical-Ethnographic Contrastive Framework with Interactive Human-Centered Explainability for Language Model Interpretation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current AI interpretability frameworks struggle to reconcile computationally learned mechanistic representations with ethnographically grounded cognitive and social language phenomena due to differences in data modality, scale, and epistemology. This gap hampers holistic understanding and trustworthy application of language models in sociolinguistic contexts.",
        "Motivation": "While previous efforts have explored either statistical or ethnographic interpretability in isolation, our approach uniquely integrates contrastive learning with ethnographic annotations using rigorously designed alignment mechanisms and an interactive explanation interface tailored for ethnographers and computational linguists. This human-centered AI system not only facilitates bidirectional interpretability but also enhances model validation and refinement through domain expert involvement, elevating novelty beyond conventional dual modeling frameworks and addressing the NOV-COMPETITIVE gap explicitly.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-modal joint training framework wherein contrastive learning-derived mechanistic embeddings from language models are aligned with ethnographic annotations via formally defined alignment losses that quantify representational congruence. The alignment loss is constructed as a weighted sum of (1) contrastive loss between mechanistic features and their corresponding ethnographic codes, and (2) a disagreement regularizer that resolves conflicting signals by optimizing a consensus objective integrating both modalities' confidence scores. The model architecture consists of a shared embedding space with dual encoders— a neural contrastive encoder for language features and a graph-based encoder for ethnographic codes, allowing cross-modal representation learning. To ensure quantitative interpretability, we develop metrics including alignment fidelity scores, interpretability consistency indices, and downstream prediction task accuracy. Beyond co-training, we introduce an interactive human-in-the-loop explanation interface that visualizes aligned representations and their contextual ethnographic narratives. Domain experts iteratively provide feedback through this interface to refine alignment parameters, resolve ambiguities, and enhance interpretability. This synergy of rigorously defined losses, dual-encoder architecture, and human-centered interaction represents a fundamental advancement over sequential fine-tuning or isolated interpretability methods, bridging computational and ethnographic data streams on different scales and modalities effectively.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Aggregate and preprocess richly annotated narrative corpora with ethnographic codes capturing language formality, social stance, and cultural context. 2) Develop dual encoders: (a) contrastive neural encoder for textual representations and (b) graph neural network encoder for ethnographic annotations, to embed both modalities into a shared space. 3) Formulate and implement precise alignment losses including contrastive and disagreement-based consensus losses with tunable weights. 4) Train the joint framework with co-training objectives on the corpora, monitoring alignment fidelity and predictive performance. 5) Construct an interactive explanation interface supporting visualization of embeddings, alignment mappings, and contextual ethnographic narratives for domain experts. 6) Conduct user studies with ethnographers and computational linguists to iteratively refine alignment parameters and interface design based on expert feedback. 7) Quantitatively evaluate interpretability metrics, predictive tasks, and human-in-the-loop alignment improvements against baseline models employing sequential fine-tuning or monomodal explanations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Narrative transcript annotated with multi-dimensional ethnographic codes such as language formality levels, speaker social stance, and contextual cultural markers. Expected Output: 1) Model embeddings that show high alignment fidelity, faithfully reflecting ethnographic categories as measured by interpretability consistency indices. 2) Interactive interface enabling domain experts to visualize and manipulate alignment dimensions, resulting in incremental improvements in both ethnographic interpretability and task performance after iterative refinements. 3) Demonstration that combined losses and dual encoding outperform sequential fine-tuning baselines by achieving higher quantitative interpretability scores and predictive accuracy.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If joint co-training with dual encoders and alignment losses underperforms or faces convergence issues, we will fallback to a two-stage pipeline with sequential fine-tuning: first train the contrastive language model, then fine-tune with domain adaptation techniques using ethnographic annotations and explicit explainability layers that link latent features to ethnographic codes. Additionally, the explanation interface will still be employed to facilitate human-in-the-loop corrections and to guide model debugging, ensuring continued interpretability improvements despite reduced model integration."

The proposal should explicitly detail how the alignment losses are formulated, how conflicting signals between statistical and ethnographic representations will be reconciled, and how interpretability will be quantitatively measured. Further specification on the model architecture and rationale for why the proposed joint framework would outperform sequential fine-tuning alternatives is essential to ensure the mechanism’s soundness and reproducibility within the complex interplay of computational and ethnographic data streams, which often operate on different scales and modalities. Strengthening this section will solidify the foundation that enables credible evaluation and improvement of both interpretability and predictive performance simultaneously, a key claimed contribution but currently underspecified in its operationalization and integration scheme in the Proposed_Method section."
