    "title": "Dynamic Concept Boundary Modeling via Volume of Information Metrics",
    "Problem_Statement": "Language models inadequately adjust to information volume fluctuations, resulting in rigid concept boundaries inconsistent with human concept formation influenced by contextual information volume.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to the external gap linking 'core social sciences' and 'volume of information' by integrating information-theoretic volume metrics to dynamically model evolving concept boundaries.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement a dynamic boundary adjustment layer within language models that computes local information volume metrics (e.g., entropy, surprisal) and uses them to modulate concept granularity and abstraction in real-time during inference.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Define formal measures of concept boundary sharpness linked to information volume. 2) Integrate volume-aware gating mechanisms in transformer layers. 3) Train on datasets annotated for concept fluidity and evaluate concept boundary alignment with human annotations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Explain the variability in the definition of 'work' across digital economy sectors.\" Expected output: Responses exhibiting flexible conceptual boundaries adapting to sector-specific information volume.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If volume-based modulation is unstable, fallback to post-processing mechanisms adjusting outputs according to pre-computed information volume profiles."
