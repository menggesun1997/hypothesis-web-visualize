    "Problem_Statement": "Mechanistic insights from language models largely overlook the social and institutional anticipatory processes that influence communication, particularly in multimodal contexts combining language with visuals or gestures.",
    "Motivation": "Building on the hidden bridge between social governance concepts and predictive modeling, we expand mechanistic analysis to multimodal language models to capture social anticipation not only linguistically but via integrated modalities, addressing key internal and external gaps.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a multimodal transformer model incorporating language and visual-social context inputs (e.g., video + transcript). Use contrastive learning to differentiate between modeled social anticipatory scenarios encoded through visual cues and institutional contexts, allowing the uncovering of layered mechanistic representations linking modalities and social anticipation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect or annotate corpora combining social interaction videos and transcripts with governance context markers. 2) Train multimodal deep language models with additional contrastive losses aligning social anticipatory states. 3) Use layerwise probing and attribution to interpret mechanistic representations of social anticipation across modalities.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Video+transcript of a medical consultation with social care policy cues.\nExpected Output: Model's higher-layer representations distinctly encode social anticipatory states correlating with governance rules, elucidating multimodal mechanisms.",

        "title": "Contrastive Learning of Social Anticipation in Multimodal Deep Language Architectures with Mechanistic Interpretability",
        "Problem_Statement": "Mechanistic insights from language models generally focus on linguistic abstractions, often overlooking how social and institutional anticipatory processes dynamically influence human communication, especially in complex multimodal settings that integrate language, visual cues, and gestures. Capturing and interpreting these social anticipatory mechanisms requires explicitly grounding model representations in social governance and action-perception frameworks, beyond correlational associations.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work applies contrastive learning to multimodal transformers, the novelty and competitiveness of this research lies in directly linking mechanistic interpretability of deep language architectures with social anticipation framed through integrative theories of communication and perception-action links. Unlike conventional multimodal modeling, this approach embeds social governance concepts and anticipatory states as structured supervisory signals, enabling the model to internalize and reveal layered mechanistic representations across modalities. This extends our understanding of complex human communicative interaction and addresses key gaps in modeling institutional and social predictive processes in deep learning.",
        "Proposed_Method": "1) Define 'social anticipatory states' operationally by integrating an action-perception framework informed by complex human communication theories: states represent predicted social outcomes and institutional constraints contextualized via visual and linguistic cues.\n\n2) Construct a multimodal transformer architecture processing aligned inputs: language transcripts, visual-social context from videos (e.g., gestures, facial expressions), and institutional markers.\n\n3) Implement a carefully designed contrastive learning objective where positive pairs are multimodal samples sharing equivalent social anticipatory states (e.g., similar policy context and social intentions), while negative pairs differ in these states (e.g., mismatched governance cues or social intentions). Annotation protocols ground these states explicitly (see experiment plan).\n\n4) Theoretical justification: contrastive loss encourages representations to cluster by social anticipation states reflecting perception-action links, disentangling social cues from superficial modality correlations.\n\n5) Employ advanced mechanistic interpretability tools—layerwise probing, attribution maps, and cross-modal attention pattern analysis—to reveal how these anticipatory states are encoded and transformed in the model’s internal layers.\n\n6) Integrate evaluation schemes quantifying interpretability and alignment with social anticipatory ground truth, moving beyond correlational insights to causal and mechanistic understanding.\n\nThis method advances beyond standard multimodal contrastive learning by explicitly modeling social anticipation as a structured predictive process grounded in communication theory and institutional context, ensuring more sound and interpretable representation learning.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data sourcing and annotation:\n   a) Select or collect corpora of social interaction videos with transcripts rich in institutional context (e.g., medical consultations, legal mediations).\n   b) Develop a detailed annotation schema for social anticipatory states, bridging theories of language production, speech monitoring, and governance context. Define annotation criteria for social intentions, predicted interlocutor responses, and institutional constraints.\n   c) Train expert annotators and evaluate inter-annotator agreement to ensure consistency and reliability.\n\n2) Model training:\n   a) Train baseline unimodal models (language-only, vision-only) with standard objectives.\n   b) Train the proposed multimodal transformer with the structured contrastive objective. Monitor training stability and resource utilization, using early-stage unimodal contrastive setups if needed.\n\n3) Evaluation:\n   a) Quantitatively assess model performance in predicting social anticipatory states (contrastive classification accuracy, retrieval metrics).\n   b) Conduct mechanistic interpretability analyses: layerwise probing of social anticipation encoding, attention pattern visualization highlighting modality integration, and attribution mapping.\n   c) Qualitatively analyze model outputs on case studies, verifying alignment with theoretical constructs from human communicative interaction.\n\n4) Milestones and feasibility:\n   a) Initial data preparation and schema design (Months 1-3).\n   b) Annotation and dataset finalization (Months 4-6).\n   c) Model pretraining and unimodal contrastive experiments (Months 7-9).\n   d) Multimodal model training and interpretability analyses (Months 10-12).\n\n5) Fallback methods rehearsed early include unimodal contrastive models and cross-modal attention visualization to isolate socially anticipatory features if fusion proves challenging.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: Input - Video + transcript of a medical consultation incorporating social care policy cues.\nExpected Output - Distinct high-level model representations encoding social anticipatory states that recursively predict patient-doctor interaction dynamics constrained by institutional rules. Interpretability probes reveal attention to policy-related visual cues influencing linguistic predictions.\n\nExample 2: Input - Legal mediation session video with transcript marked by governance and negotiation cues.\nExpected Output - Model internal states cluster according to anticipatory negotiation strategies and institutional mandates, with attribution analyses identifying relevant visual gestures and language levels contributing to anticipatory encoding.\n\nThese examples test the model’s ability to mechanistically integrate modality cues into structured social anticipatory representations consistent with theoretical frameworks.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If modality fusion destabilizes interpretability or training:\n1) Deploy unimodal contrastive models separately on language and visual streams, using the same annotated social anticipatory states.\n2) Employ cross-modal attention visualization to connect unimodal representations, indirectly probing social anticipation features across modalities.\n3) Adjust annotation granularity to simplify social anticipatory states, reducing noise and enhancing training stability.\n4) Incorporate curriculum learning or progressive training from unimodal to multimodal tasks.\nThis staged strategy ensures feasibility while preserving the core research objectives related to social anticipation and mechanistic interpretability."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a high-level strategy of combining multimodal transformers with contrastive learning to uncover social anticipatory representations. However, the exact mechanism by which contrastive learning will encode and differentiate 'social anticipatory states' remains underspecified. What precisely constitutes positive vs. negative pairs in the contrastive loss? How will the model operationalize 'social anticipation' in the feature space beyond correlating with governance cues? Clarify these mechanisms and their theoretical justification to ensure soundness and interpretability of the learned representations in multimodal contexts, rather than relying on correlational insights alone. Explicit example scenarios in training could strengthen clarity here, and improve reliability of mechanistic interpretation methods like probing and attribution applied downstream to the model's layers. This is critical given the ambition to link mechanistic interpretability with complex social and institutional signals across modalities, which is non-trivial and requires careful architectural and objective design choices to avoid spurious associations or confounds in learned representations, especially in a noisy multimodal environment with social governance signals embedded in real data streams such as video+transcript of consultations with policy cues. Addressing this will greatly improve the research's soundness and clarity in its claims and findings about social anticipatory mechanisms within the model's representation space and processing pipeline, strengthening theoretical grounding and experimental rigor alike.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is conceptually appropriate but currently ambitious and lacking detail on feasibility, especially regarding data collection and annotation. Gathering or creating corpora with sufficiently rich social interaction videos, precise transcripts, and annotated governance context markers is challenging, given the diverse, complex nature of social anticipatory signals and governance cues. This raises feasibility risks that could stall or bias the project. I recommend elaborating concrete criteria for corpus selection or annotation protocols, including defining the social anticipatory states operationally for annotation, clarifying annotation schema consistency, and considering existing datasets or partnerships for scalable data sourcing. Further, given potential modality fusion difficulties, specifying quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics for both model performance and interpretability probes is needed to gauge success effectively. Explicit plans on computational resource needs, training stability with multimodal contrastive objectives, and fallback methods to test unimodal contrastive models with cross-modal attention visualization as outlined are commendable but should be rehearsed early. A more detailed and staged experimental plan with milestones addressing these challenges will make the overall research more feasible and robust to practical obstacles."
