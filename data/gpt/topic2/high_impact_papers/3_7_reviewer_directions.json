    "title": "Embedding Avoidance Motivation Dynamics into Predictive Language Models via Contrastive Learning",
    "Problem_Statement": "Avoidance achievement motivation's effect on language processing is under-modeled mechanistically, leaving unseen how motivational avoidance impacts language representations in AI.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by the hidden bridges to biological psychology, this project embeds continuous dynamics of avoidance motivation states into predictive language models using contrastive learning to reveal their mechanistic role in language generation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce time-evolving latent variables representing avoidance motivation into hierarchical generative language models, trained with temporally contrastive losses to distinguish language produced under varied motivational dynamics. This captures mechanistic influences over time.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect longitudinal language data labeled with avoidance motivation proxies. 2) Implement temporal contrastive loss modules with sequence modeling architectures. 3) Evaluate predictive accuracy and representational coherence with psychological assessments of motivation dynamics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Journal entries reflecting increasing avoidance motivation.\nExpected Output: Model shows progressive shifts in latent representations aligned with motivational escalation, explaining language changes mechanistically.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If temporal modeling is unstable, experiment with static latent motivational states or incorporate physiological data modalities for multi-view learning."

However, the mechanism by which these latent dynamics mechanistically influence language generation is underspecified. For instance, it is unclear how the contrastive loss formulation concretely captures motivational shifts over time, how these variables interact hierarchically within the model, and whether existing modeling paradigms can accommodate continuous motivational dynamics without instability. Clarify the architecture details, mathematical formulation, and expected causal pathways from motivational states to language output to strengthen methodological soundness and reproducibility. Providing a concrete model schematic or pseudo-code would be valuable here to illustrate the mechanism clearly and convince reviewers of its validity and novelty beyond established contrastive learning approaches in NLP.  This will ensure that assumptions about the temporal evolution of avoidance motivation and their effect on language representations are well justified and lead to sound outcomes.

However, this plan lacks concrete details on how avoidance motivation will be reliably measured or proxied longitudinally in language data. Given the complexity of psychological motivational states and their subtle linguistic manifestations, define what are the specific proxies or annotation protocols and their validity. Further, potential confounds in longitudinal journaling data (e.g., mood, context shifts) should be addressed in data design or controls. Clarify the scale and nature of the dataset, how temporal alignment between linguistic features and motivation states is guaranteed, and how model evaluation metrics will specifically test the mechanistic hypothesis rather than generic predictive accuracy. Also, the fallback involving physiological data is promising but underspecified; explain feasibility in terms of data modality fusion and participant recruitment. Without these clarifications, the experimental plan risks being impractical or unable to demonstrate the intended contributions convincingly. Target: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
