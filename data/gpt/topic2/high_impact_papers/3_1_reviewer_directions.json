    "title": "Ethno-Contrastive Interpretability: Bridging Qualitative Linguistics with AI Mechanisms",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a conceptual divide between qualitative ethnographic insights into language and computational interpretability methods, restricting explanations of language model behavior that capture identity and social nuance.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the internal methodological gap of lacking frameworks that combine ethnographic methodologies with computational contrastive learning, this work blends Paul Atkinson's qualitative traditions with mechanistic contrastive modeling to yield hybrid, human-relevant interpretability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a hybrid interpretability model that integrates ethnographic annotation data (e.g., discourse markers indicating identity, social roles) into contrastive learning objectives. The language model learns to distinguish contrasting social meanings and identities encoded in language, guided by qualitative labels, thus grounding mechanistic explanations in ethnographic reality.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct datasets of conversational text richly annotated with ethnographic social identity features. 2) Implement contrastive losses that maximize representation differences aligned with ethnographic categories. 3) Evaluate model interpretability through qualitative expert assessment and quantitative metrics of social meaning separability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Conversational excerpt with identity markers like code-switching.\nExpected Output: Model layers reveal distinct embeddings corresponding to identity shifts, explaining language generation decisions linked to social context.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If annotations are noisy or scarce, experiment with semi-supervised approaches or data augmentation using synthetic ethnographic narratives. Explore attention-based explanation methods to complement contrastive interpretations."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines integrating ethnographic annotation data into contrastive learning objectives to yield human-relevant interpretability. However, the mechanism of how exactly qualitative annotations will quantitatively guide the contrastive loss and how this grounding will technically manifest in the model's internal representations needs elaboration. For instance, is there a defined mapping from ethnographic labels to contrastive positives/negatives, and how will multiple social identity features be integrated within the model's architecture? Clarifying these technical details will strengthen the conceptual soundness and facilitate reproducibility and validation by others, especially given the novelty lies in bridging qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Consider including a concrete architectural diagram or pseudocode to demonstrate the integration and interplay between ethnographic data and contrastive objectives within the language model framework. This will ensure the research idea is not only novel but also technically grounded and clear in its implementation plan, fulfilling the core aim of mechanistic interpretability grounded in ethnographic insights without ambiguity or overgeneralization in method design.\n\nTarget: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty assessment classified this work as NOV-COMPETITIVE, to enhance both its novelty and broader impact, the proposal should explicitly connect its methodology and findings to well-established interdisciplinary frameworks from sociolinguistics and conversation analysisâ€”particularly concepts like ethnomethodological conversation analysis and the study of language variation. For example, incorporating theories from the Routledge Handbook or the Oxford Handbook on sociolinguistics could position the model as a tool not just for AI interpretability but for advancing empirical social science research on language use, identity, and cross-cultural communication. \n\nThis can be achieved by expanding the ethnographic feature annotations with established social interaction markers from corpus linguistics and conversation analysis, or using think-aloud protocols to validate model explanations with human linguistic experts. Engaging with these globally linked concepts will help situate the contribution at the nexus of AI interpretability and applied linguistics, thereby widening its audience and solidifying its competitive edge in a crowded research landscape. It also encourages collaboration, dataset sharing, and impact in social science domains alongside AI, ultimately broadening the research's scope and applicability.\n\nTarget: Motivation"
