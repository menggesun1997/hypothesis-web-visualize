    "title": "Motivation-Embedded Hierarchical Predictive Models for Affective Language Representations",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current mechanistic language models do not incorporate latent motivational and affective states such as avoidance motivation and test anxiety, missing critical influences on language prediction and representation.",
    "Motivation": "This idea exploits the novel external gap linking biological psychology concepts of motivation and affect (e.g., avoidance, anxiety) to hierarchical generative language models, thereby expanding mechanistic models beyond perception-action loops towards embodied cognition.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a hierarchical generative language model augmented with latent affective state variables (modeled as stochastic nodes) integrated via contrastive learning that contrasts language conditioned on different motivational-affective state simulations. The model learns mechanistic mappings from motivational states to observable language patterns, enabling affect-aware interpretability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compile datasets including language produced under different affective and motivational states (e.g., exam essays with test anxiety metadata). 2) Architect latent variable models conditioning language predictions on affective embeddings. 3) Use contrastive learning objectives to force separation of motivational states in representation space. 4) Evaluate in terms of interpretability, predictive coherence under emotional state shifts, and correlation with psychological measures.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Statement from a student under test anxiety versus calm state.\nExpected Output: Model's latent motivational embeddings differ significantly and cause distinct prediction patterns, explaining state-dependent language variation mechanistically.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If latent variables prove unstable, try discrete rather than continuous representations of motivational states or use adversarial training to enforce disentangled affective features."
