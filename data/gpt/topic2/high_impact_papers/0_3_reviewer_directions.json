    "title": "Multimodal Cognitive Alignment: Linking Language Model Interpretability to Human Media Processing",
    "Problem_Statement": "Language model interpretability methods neglect the multimodal nature of human communication and cognitive processing, limiting insights into human-model alignment in media-rich dialogues.",
    "Motivation": "Targets internal and external gaps concerning lack of nuanced cognitive process modeling for multimodal communication. This work uniquely synthesizes multimodal media studies with AI interpretability to align LMs with human cognitive media processing.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an alignment framework that maps LM internal representations and explanations onto known cognitive media processing signatures (e.g., visual attention, auditory cues). The method incorporates synchronized multimodal input-explanation pairs linked to psychological theories on media comprehension.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate multi-turn multimedia dialogue datasets (text, images, audio). 2) Develop LM variants with multimodal input. 3) Generate explanations via multimodal saliency and attention. 4) Collect cognitive user studies on media comprehension. 5) Compute alignment metrics between model explanations and cognitive signals.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User interacts with chatbot referencing an image and spoken content. Output: Explanation highlights relevant multimodal components corresponding with human attention data. Expected: High alignment scores confirm model interpretability reflects human cognitive media processing.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cognitive alignment proves weak, fallback to unimodal experiments focusing separately on text or image explanations and gradually reassess multimodal approaches."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan, particularly step 4 involving cognitive user studies on media comprehension, lacks concrete detail about experimental design, sample size, participant diversity, and data collection protocols. Given the complexity of aligning language model explanations with nuanced human multimodal cognitive signals (e.g., visual attention, auditory cues), the feasibility of obtaining high-quality, synchronized cognitive signals that can be meaningfully compared to model explanations is unclear. To strengthen feasibility, specify how cognitive data will be collected (e.g., eye-tracking hardware, EEG, behavioral measures), the scope of user studies (number of participants, controlled conditions), and the validation protocols for alignment metrics. Clarifying these aspects will ensure the experiment plan can realistically support the main research claims and avoid ambiguous or inconclusive results that could undermine impact and soundness assumptions. Also, consider computational and annotation resource requirements for multimodal input-explanation generation and alignment evaluation, as these remain non-trivial and may affect experiment feasibility and reproducibility at scale. This more detailed experimental design will help demonstrate scientific rigor and practical attainability of the research goals without critical gaps or overly optimistic assumptions about data collection and alignment measurement complexity. This targets the 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' section directly, focusing on feasibility and execution clarity.  \n\n---\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "To enhance the idea’s impact and overcome the intrinsic novelty competition in this area, consider integrating the concept of 'English listening comprehension' or general 'listening comprehension' from cognitive psychology as a concrete use case or evaluation benchmark. For instance, aligning LM explanations not only with standard multimodal cues but specifically with human behavioral and neural markers known from listening comprehension studies could ground the framework in a well-established cognitive domain. \n\nAdditionally, incorporating techniques or insights from 'multimodal data fusion' and 'representation of deep neural networks' could refine the alignment mechanism—for example, exploring advanced fusion architectures like recurrent convolutional neural networks that effectively handle audio-visual input and textual data jointly could improve internal representations and explanation quality.\n\nFinally, positioning this research in the context of advancing 'intelligent decision-making' or enhancing 'question-answering systems' that operate on multimodal dialogues could broaden applicability and demonstrate clear downstream impact, making the contribution more compelling to both AI and cognitive science communities. This suggestion target is overall enhancement but should be acted upon primarily in the 'Proposed_Method' and 'Title/Impact' framing to increase novelty and relevance in a competitive research landscape."
