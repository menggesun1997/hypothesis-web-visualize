        "title": "TrustLens: User-Centric Interpretability Metrics Integrating Psychological Trust Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current interpretability metrics for language models lack incorporation of user trust dynamics, especially in conversational AI interacting in multimedia environments. This limits understanding of how explanations affect user trust and decision-making.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient user-centric interpretability assessments and exploits the hidden bridge between communication research and psychology domains integrating technology trust constructs. This is novel by explicitly modeling user trust as an interpretability metric, uniting communication and psychological insights.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design and implement TrustLens, a framework that quantifies interpretability not only by model explainability features but also by measuring user trust via psychological constructs (e.g., perceived reliability, transparency). The method combines post-hoc explanation generation with user feedback collected through interactive multimedia dialogues to dynamically adapt explanations fostering trust.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect conversational data with multimedia context. 2) Build XAI explanation modules (attention visualization, causal attributions). 3) Develop surveys and experiments for users rating trust-related metrics during interaction. 4) Analyze correlations between explanations and trust scores. 5) Compare TrustLens with traditional interpretability metrics and assess impact on user trust and decision efficacy.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User asks a healthcare chatbot about medication side effects with visual aids. Output: Explanations presented via textual justifications complemented by highlight overlays on multimedia content. Expected: Users report higher trust scores and better understanding via the TrustLens-adapted explanations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If user trust is hard to quantify reliably, fallback to qualitative interviews and focus groups to gather interpretability feedback. Alternatively, simulate trust via proxy behavioral metrics (e.g., continued interaction, adherence)."

        "title": "Hybrid Discourse-XAI Evaluation: Mapping Failure Modes of Conversational Agents",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing failure mode analyses of language models rely either on AI-centric explainability tools or communication research methods separately, limiting a cohesive understanding of failure in dialogue.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap of insufficient domain-specific interpretability approaches by bridging discourse analysis (communication research) with advanced XAI techniques into a hybrid evaluation methodology. The innovation lies in jointly mapping linguistic discourse phenomena with explanation traces from models.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a pipeline combining scenario-based discourse analysis (e.g., identifying coherence breaks, turnaround errors) with layer-wise relevance propagation and saliency maps from language models. This hybrid approach annotates dialogues with discourse errors tagged alongside XAI-generated reasoning patterns to pinpoint root causes.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Create scenario-based dialogue datasets with annotated discourse errors. 2) Fine-tune language models on these scenarios. 3) Apply XAI techniques (LRP, Integrated Gradients) to generate explanations. 4) Integrate discourse annotations with XAI maps to identify failure clusters. 5) Evaluate against baseline interpretability methods on error detection and explanation clarity.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Customer support chatbot dialogue where the agent contradicts previous answers. Output: Discourse analysis flags contradiction; XAI techniques highlight input tokens leading to incoherent response. Expected: The hybrid method offers clear interpretability on both linguistic and model-level failure causes.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If integration is too noisy, employ hierarchical evaluationâ€”first assess discourse errors, then independently evaluate XAI explanations, later combine findings manually or via feature selection techniques."

        "title": "CognitiveTrust Framework: Interpretable Language Models for Healthcare Chatbots",
        "Problem_Statement": "Healthcare chatbots require interpretable models that build user trust and support informed decision-making; current frameworks do not sufficiently tailor interpretability to sensitive biomedical contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the external novel gap by integrating cognitive psychology and biomedical informatics to develop domain-specific interpretability, focusing on trust and well-being in healthcare chatbot interactions. Novelty lies in specialized frameworks for sensitive contexts informed by cross-disciplinary insights.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design CognitiveTrust, an interpretability framework embedding cognitive trust models within language model explanations contextualized for healthcare. It uses transparent dialogue summarization, rationale generation aligned with medical knowledge bases, and interactive trust-aware explanation layers.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather healthcare chatbot interaction data annotated with trust and satisfaction metrics. 2) Integrate external biomedical knowledge graphs. 3) Develop multi-level explanation mechanisms (surface explanations, clinical rationale, cognitive trust signals). 4) Evaluate with patient simulators and real users on trust, comprehension, and decision support effectiveness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient asks chatbot about side effects of a complex treatment. Output: Multi-layered explanation includes simple language rationale, linked biomedical references, and confidence levels. Expected: Users demonstrate greater trust and improved adherence intentions reflecting effective interpretability.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If biomedical knowledge integration is challenging, fallback to curated FAQs with explanation templates. Alternative evaluation via expert user studies to validate explanations in absence of large datasets."

        "title": "Multimodal Cognitive Alignment: Linking Language Model Interpretability to Human Media Processing",
        "Problem_Statement": "Language model interpretability methods neglect the multimodal nature of human communication and cognitive processing, limiting insights into human-model alignment in media-rich dialogues.",
        "Motivation": "Targets internal and external gaps concerning lack of nuanced cognitive process modeling for multimodal communication. This work uniquely synthesizes multimodal media studies with AI interpretability to align LMs with human cognitive media processing.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create an alignment framework that maps LM internal representations and explanations onto known cognitive media processing signatures (e.g., visual attention, auditory cues). The method incorporates synchronized multimodal input-explanation pairs linked to psychological theories on media comprehension.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate multi-turn multimedia dialogue datasets (text, images, audio). 2) Develop LM variants with multimodal input. 3) Generate explanations via multimodal saliency and attention. 4) Collect cognitive user studies on media comprehension. 5) Compute alignment metrics between model explanations and cognitive signals.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User interacts with chatbot referencing an image and spoken content. Output: Explanation highlights relevant multimodal components corresponding with human attention data. Expected: High alignment scores confirm model interpretability reflects human cognitive media processing.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If cognitive alignment proves weak, fallback to unimodal experiments focusing separately on text or image explanations and gradually reassess multimodal approaches."

        "title": "Behavioral-Adaptive Explanation Interfaces for Enhancing User Trust in Conversational AI",
        "Problem_Statement": "Most explanation interfaces for language models provide static explanations failing to adapt dynamically to user behavior or cognitive state, restricting their effectiveness in building user trust.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses lack of user behavior integration and dynamic interpretability assessments highlighted in both internal and external gaps. Inspired by psychology and communication research, it proposes behavior-adaptive interfaces to tailor explanations in real time.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive explanation interface that monitors user engagement signals (e.g., interaction patterns, response latency) to modulate explanation granularity and style. It includes reinforcement learning to optimize explanations that maximize trust and comprehension per user.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build prototype explanation interface integrated with chatbot backend. 2) Collect interaction data capturing behavioral signals. 3) Implement reinforcement learning algorithms for explanation policy optimization. 4) Compare user trust and satisfaction across static vs adaptive explanation conditions.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User shows confusion by repeated clarifications. Output: Interface switches to more elaborate and example-driven explanations automatically. Expected: Increased user trust and reduced repeated queries.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If behavior signals are noisy, fallback to heuristic-based adaptation rules. Also consider post-interaction surveys to refine policies."
