    "title": "Fuzzy-Qualitative Neural Systems for Organizational Concept Ambiguity",
    "Problem_Statement": "Language models currently struggle to capture and interpret ambiguous, context-dependent human concepts prevalent in socio-organizational contexts due to rigid learning paradigms and limited qualitative theory integration.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal siloing between social science theories and computational models by combining fuzzy set theory and qualitative comparative analysis with neural methods, introducing interpretability and contextual grounding.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a fuzzy-neural hybrid system where language model representations are augmented with fuzzy logic layers that operate over soft qualitative variables derived from organizational digital transformation case data. This system dynamically adjusts concept boundaries according to contextual cues, guided by qualitative comparative analysis outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather organizational case study corpora and qualitative codes of digital transformations. 2) Translate qualitative variables into fuzzy sets and integrate these with neural embeddings. 3) Train end-to-end on narrative generation and concept classification tasks, evaluating interpretability (via attention visualization) and ambiguity resolution against baselines that lack fuzzy components.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Assess the success factors affecting digital transformation in manufacturing firms.\" Expected output: An explanation that reflects nuanced conceptual shades (e.g., partial success, contextual dependencies) with explicit representations of fuzzy membership values indicating strength of factors in different contexts.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If fuzzy hybridization underperforms, fallback to post-hoc symbolic rule integration based on qualitative comparative analysis results or develop an interpretable surrogate model to approximate fuzzy reasoning outputs."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes augmenting language model representations with fuzzy logic layers operating over soft qualitative variables derived from organizational case data, dynamically adjusting concept boundaries with guidance from qualitative comparative analysis. However, the mechanism by which fuzzy logic integrates end-to-end with neural embeddings lacks detail. Specifically, clarity is needed on how fuzzy membership functions are constructed and updated within training, how qualitative comparative analysis outputs concretely influence parameter adjustment, and how the hybrid architecture avoids common pitfalls like gradient incompatibilities or information bottlenecks. Strengthening this conceptual mechanism with explicit architectural schematics or algorithmic formulations will substantively improve soundness and practical implementation clarity for reviewers and implementers alike. Consider elaborating on the interplay between fuzzy variables and attention mechanisms, or how the system maintains differentiability during training to avoid optimization issues inherent in fuzzy-neural hybrids. This precision will better validate core assumptions and feasibility expectations in subsequent experiments and supports advances beyond existing works in this competitive domain.  Target this enhancement in the Proposed_Method section to clarify the concrete hybrid model design and training dynamics, tightening the foundational reasoning behind the contribution's novelty and usefulness to organizational concept ambiguity resolution tasks."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is sound in its general approach, progressing from collecting organizational case corpora and qualitative codes to fuzzy set integration and end-to-end training on narrative generation and concept classification tasks. However, it currently lacks specifics that would ensure feasibility and reproducibility: details on dataset scale or sources, criteria for qualitative code selection and fuzzification heuristics, training regimes (e.g., loss functions reflecting fuzzy membership learning), baseline configurations, and evaluation metrics beyond subjective interpretability (attention visualization). Additionally, clarifying procedures to quantify ambiguity resolution improvement objectively over baselines will strengthen claims on impact. Explicit plans to validate the dynamic adjustment capability and fallback mechanism when fuzzy hybridization underperforms are needed to mitigate risks. Expanding this section with these particulars will increase confidence that the method's novel combination can be practically realized and fairly benchmarked, thus supporting reliable claims of advance in handling context-dependent socio-organizational ambiguities."
