    "title": "Ethically-Aware Forecasting Language Models for Socio-Technical Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a significant gap in embedding ethical, legal, and epistemic considerations into language models used for forecasting human conceptual dynamics in complex socio-technical systems, affecting trust and accountability.",
    "Motivation": "This project leverages the external gap involving ethical AI frameworks and forecasting techniques to create transparent and accountable language models, addressing the research need for embedding ethics into conceptual modeling.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an ethically-guided training pipeline that incorporates legal and ethical constraints as soft logic rules embedded in the loss function of forecasting language models. Incorporate open-source information volume management techniques to regulate data representation, ensuring epistemic integrity and transparency throughout model predictions.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate datasets from socio-technical system domain with annotations for ethical/legal aspects. 2) Formalize ethical and legal constraints into differentiable logic. 3) Implement constraint-aware training within a transformer forecasting model. 4) Benchmark on predictive accuracy, ethical compliance metrics, and stakeholder trust surveys compared to unconstrained baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Forecast organizational shifts in response to new privacy regulations in digital platforms.\" Expected output: Predictions balanced with explicit reasoning about legal constraints and ethical risks, with transparency notes explaining model confidence and caveats.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct logic embedding is infeasible, fallback to a post-hoc ethical risk assessment module that reviews model outputs, or incorporate human-in-the-loop verification during critical forecasting tasks."
