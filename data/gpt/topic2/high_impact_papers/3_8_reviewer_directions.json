    "title": "Contrastive Ethnography-Guided Framework for Language Model Social-Cognitive Alignment",
    "Problem_Statement": "Deep language models lack mechanistic alignment with detailed social-cognitive ethnographic insights, limiting their explanatory power in language identity and social interaction realms.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the conceptual divide by integrating ethnographic cognitive social insights with mechanistic contrastive learning formulations, this project pioneer a framework for cognitive-social alignment in language AI interpretability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop contrastive learning architectures trained on ethnographically annotated datasets capturing fine-grained social-cognitive phenomena. The training aligns model representations with cognitive-social semantic dimensions through guided contrastive pairs reflecting ethnographic categories.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate ethnographic datasets of conversational interactions rich in social-cognitive labels. 2) Implement contrastive losses that respect ethnographic pairwise similarities and dissimilarities. 3) Quantify alignment by measuring embedding separability and human expert validation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Dialogue annotated with social roles and interactional strategies.\nExpected Output: Model embeddings cluster by social-cognitive categories, revealing mechanistic correspondences.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If social-cognitive labels are insufficient, augment datasets with proxy indicators or use active learning to refine ethnographic annotations."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes the availability and sufficiency of ethnographically annotated datasets capturing detailed social-cognitive phenomena for training language models. However, such datasets are scarce, often limited in size, and complex to annotate reliably, which may undermine the foundational premise of mechanistic alignment via contrastive learning. It is crucial to explicitly address the assumptions about data availability, annotation consistency, and representativeness, and to clarify how these challenges will be mitigated to validate the core hypothesis of social-cognitive alignment through contrastive methods in language models. Clarifying these assumptions upfront will strengthen the conceptual foundation and guide realistic expectations regarding model performance and interpretability gains derived from ethnographic insights, making the claim more sound and credible at a mechanistic level. This critique targets the 'Problem_Statement' and 'Proposed_Method' sections to ensure the premise and methodology are tightly integrated and well-substantiated for soundness evaluation purposes."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The experiment plan outlines curation, implementation of contrastive losses with ethnographic pairwise relationships, and embedding evaluation via human expert validation. While conceptually coherent, it lacks critical operational details on how ethnographic annotations will be consistently and scalably sourced or augmented, especially given the known sparsity in such data. Furthermore, the plan does not specify benchmarking baselines, quantitative metrics beyond embedding separability, or steps ensuring replicability and robustness in results. Given the novelty and complexity, feasibility depends heavily on pragmatic annotation schemes, validation protocols, and integration with existing datasets or proxies. The plan should incorporate concrete strategies for data acquisition (including fallback annotation methods), detail of contrastive loss formulation reflecting social-cognitive dimensions, and a multi-faceted evaluation strategy combining quantitative and qualitative metrics. This will enhance the rigor and credibility of the experimental approach, providing clear pathways to execution and measurable success criteria. This feedback is focused on refining the 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' for feasibility enhancement."
