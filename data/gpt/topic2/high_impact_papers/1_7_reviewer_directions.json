    "title": "Social Support Network Simulation Embedded in LLM Personality Evaluation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing benchmarks omit modeling the influence of perceived social support on personality expression in LLMs, missing critical psychological context.",
    "Motivation": "Incorporates social support concepts from the hidden bridge to enhance personality benchmarks with environmental social network factors, addressing internal and external gaps in psychological richness (Opportunities 1 and 2).",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an LLM benchmarking paradigm where personality trait outputs are generated under simulated social support network conditions. Social support networks are modeled as variable weighted graphs influencing contextual embeddings prior to final output. Personality responses are measured under varying support scenarios reflecting real-world social dynamics.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Create datasets representing different social support network scenarios. 2) Model support as adjustable embeddings integrated into LLM prompts. 3) Measure resulting shifts in personality trait metrics. 4) Analyze correlation between network support parameters and personality expression metrics. 5) Validate with expert psychological assessment of output realism.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt with high social support context: \"Describe coping strategies for stress.\" Output: Positive, proactive, and resilient communication style; Low support context yields more withdrawn or anxious output.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If embedding conditioning is insufficiently sensitive, incorporate reinforcement learning to better align responses with simulated support context."

          "feedback_content": "While the concept of integrating social support networks as weighted graphs influencing contextual embeddings is promising, the Proposed_Method lacks precise methodological detail on how embeddings will be adjusted or combined with LLM internal states. Clarify the exact mechanism for embedding conditioning, the mathematical formulation of influence propagation from network weights to embeddings, and how this altered context will interact with the LLM's personality trait generation. Providing a concrete example or schematic would enhance clarity and credibility, ensuring this novel mechanism is convincingly sound rather than conceptually vague or speculative without engineering proof-of-concept evidence. This will strengthen confidence in the soundness of the approach and its contribution beyond existing personality evaluation benchmarks that lack social context modeling. Targeting precise embedding integration methods and their impact on LLM outputs is essential to establish mechanistic validity and reproducibility of the approach in the Proposed_Method section."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating, the research impact could be significantly boosted by explicitly leveraging related globally-linked concepts such as multi-agent systems or social media contexts. For instance, extend the simulation framework to model dynamic multi-agent social interactions where multiple LLM personalities interact under varying social support conditions, closer to real-world social networks. Alternatively, incorporating social media as a data source for graph construction or embedding real-time social dynamics could improve ecological validity and relevance. Such integration would deepen the psychological and social realism of the evaluations and broaden applicability beyond isolated personality benchmarks to interactive, socially-embedded agent modeling. Explicitly proposing this integration in the final research agenda or future work would enhance novelty and potential impact, positioning the work as a foundational bridge between LLM personality modeling and socially grounded computational social science."
