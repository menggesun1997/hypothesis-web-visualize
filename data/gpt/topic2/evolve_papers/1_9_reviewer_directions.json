    "title": "Cross-Modal Prompt Engineering for Mask Transformer Scientific Benchmarks",
    "Problem_Statement": "Prompting scientific language models for zero-shot or few-shot tasks often ignores cross-modal contextual cues, leading to suboptimal generalization and underutilization of scientific imagery and diagrams.",
    "Motivation": "In response to critical gaps in zero-shot learning and cross-domain semantic robustness, exploring cross-modal prompt engineering combines textual and visual cues for scientific benchmarks, enhancing masked-transformer-based foundation models.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design prompt templates that integrate textual instructions with masked visual region hints derived from relevant scientific diagrams. Employ a mask transformer framework that conditionally attends to these cross-modal prompts enabling improved zero-shot task performance. Develop adaptive prompt generators based on scientific domain and task context, allowing generalized foundation model use.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Collect scientific reasoning tasks with paired text and images. (2) Design and implement cross-modal prompt templates combining textual instruction and masked image hints. (3) Fine-tune or test large mask transformer models with these prompts on zero-shot tasks. (4) Benchmark task accuracy versus standard prompting techniques. (5) Analyze prompt sensitivity and generalization across domains.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A scientific question with textual prompt plus masked molecular diagram highlighting reaction sites. Expected output: Model answers question correctly by attending to both prompt and visual hints exploiting masked transformer attention.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If prompt engineering insufficiently improves results, integrate multimodal contrastive learning to better align textual and visual prompt components. Alternatively, explore trainable prompt tuning methods."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines designing prompts that integrate textual instructions with masked visual region hints within a mask transformer framework to enhance zero-shot performance. However, the mechanism by which the model conditionally attends to cross-modal prompts lacks sufficient technical clarity. It is unclear how masked visual regions are encoded and fused with textual prompts within the transformer architecture, and whether the model requires additional architectural modifications or multi-modal pretraining. Elaborating on these details would clarify the soundness of the approach and better justify the claimed gains from cross-modal prompt engineering, reducing ambiguity for reproducibility and evaluation purposes. Consider specifying the integration strategy (e.g., token-level fusion, cross-attention layers) and model adaptations explicitly in Proposed_Method to strengthen the soundness of the mechanism. Targeting this improvement first will solidify confidence in the approach's novelty and effectiveness before extensive experimentation is conducted or impact is claimed. Target section: Proposed_Method."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty rating is only NOV-COMPETITIVE and the research idea focuses on scientific benchmark tasks involving textual and visual cues, the impact and novelty could be enhanced by integrating insights from related, globally-linked concepts such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training and prompt learning. Specifically, exploring a multimodal contrastive self-supervised learning framework to pre-align text and image embeddings before prompt engineering could improve semantic alignment and generalization, addressing the semantic gap in science domain visual cues. Additionally, incorporating adaptive prompt tuning methods within this contrastive paradigm might yield stronger transfer and zero-shot capabilities. This integration would differentiate the work from existing mask transformer probably unimodal prompt approaches and amplify its impact on vision-language model research, especially in scientific and medical visual question answering domains, where scarcity of labeled data is a critical bottleneck. Suggest expanding the method and fallback plans accordingly to leverage these related advances and improve novelty and broader applicability. Target section: Proposed_Method and Fallback_Plan."
