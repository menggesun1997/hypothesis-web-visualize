        "title": "Graph Neural Network-Enhanced Fidelity Metrics Inspired by Genetic Mutation and Linguistic Evolution for AI-Generated Multilingual Scientific Texts",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing evaluation metrics fall short in accurately capturing the fidelity and resilience of AI-generated multilingual scientific texts, especially in preserving scientific accuracy after successive cross-lingual translations and generational language transformations. Current approaches often rely on simplistic perturbations and lack mechanisms to robustly measure semantic drift across diverse domains and underrepresented languages.",
        "Motivation": "Building on the analogy between genetic mutation and linguistic variation, this project aims to advance fidelity evaluation by integrating biologically inspired mutation frameworks with cutting-edge graph neural networks (GNNs) that model the evolutionary processes of language change. By explicitly simulating realistic linguistic mutations grounded in language structure and change dynamics, and tracking semantic shifts via GNNs over cross-lingual knowledge graphs, the approach provides a novel, interpretable, and scientifically rooted metric suite. This positions the project beyond conventional perturbation-based robustness checks, offering granular fidelity assessment sensitive to domain- and language-specific semantic drift, thereby addressing a crucial gap in multilingual scientific NLP evaluation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-component fidelity metric framework combining controlled, linguistically and evolutionarily motivated mutation operators with graph neural network-based semantic drift quantification across multilingual domain-specific knowledge graphs. Mutation Operators: We design and calibrate mutation operators reflecting plausible linguistic variations observed in scientific communication across languages and over time, inspired by linguistic evolution processes and the structure of human language. Operators include lexeme substitutions constrained by semantic similarity, syntax tree transformations simulating realistic grammatical alternations, and semantic perturbations guided by domain ontologies. Calibration: We analyze corpora of scientific texts across languages and translation histories to statistically ground mutation distributions, ensuring realistic perturbation patterns rather than arbitrary noise. Semantic Drift Measurement: We represent scientific facts from original and mutated/generated texts as embeddings on multilingual knowledge graphs incorporating domain ontologies and language mappings. GNNs are trained to model the propagation and transformation of semantic information across 'generations' of texts, capturing subtle shifts induced by mutations and translations. This learned representation allows robust, fine-grained quantification of fact preservation or distortion as semantic drift scores. The integration enables tracking fidelity across languages and domains with high interpretability. This approach differentiates from existing perturbation or robustness evaluation methods by unifying biologically and linguistically inspired mutation modeling with state-of-the-art graph representation learning that simulates language change processes and generations of language users. The method's novelty and competitiveness emerge from this fusion, yielding a scalable, adaptable, and scientifically grounded fidelity metric suite with superior domain and multilingual robustness evaluation capabilities.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Curation: Assemble a multilingual corpus of scientific texts with annotated factual content and expert-verified translations spanning multiple underrepresented languages and domains. 2. Mutation Operator Development: Define and quantitatively calibrate mutation operators using statistical analysis of linguistic variation in scientific translations and historical language change data. 3. Knowledge Graph Construction: Build and align multilingual domain-specific knowledge graphs encoding scientific facts, terminology, and ontological relations. 4. GNN Model Design: Develop graph neural network architectures to embed text-derived fact representations and model semantic transformations across mutated and translated versions, simulating language change generations. 5. Validation of Mutation Realism: Perform targeted experiments comparing mutation-induced perturbations with real-world linguistic variations observed in corpus data; refine operators accordingly. 6. Semantic Drift Quantification: Apply GNNs to compute semantic drift scores across mutated/generated texts; correlate these scores with expert human fidelity assessments to verify robustness and interpretability. 7. Benchmarking: Evaluate the developed fidelity metrics against baseline robustness and fidelity measures on diverse AI-generated multilingual scientific outputs, analyzing correlations with downstream scientific NLP task performance and error patterns. 8. Ablation Studies: Examine contributions of mutation operator types, GNN architectures, and knowledge graph characteristics to metric effectiveness for comprehensive insight.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An AI-generated medical research abstract in Arabic undergoing mutation operators including domain-synonym lexical substitutions constrained by medical ontologies, syntax tree rearrangements reflecting plausible Arabic grammatical alternations, and semantic perturbations grounded in factual ontology variances. Output: A detailed fidelity score summarizing semantic drift quantified via GNN embeddings on a multilingual medical knowledge graph, reflecting high preservation of core scientific facts despite controlled perturbations. Additional outputs highlight sensitivity and vulnerabilities to particular mutation types, supported by visualizations of fact movement in the knowledge graph embedding space. Comparative case studies include cross-lingual re-translations and generation outputs in fields like environmental science and physics to demonstrate scalability and domain adaptability.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should direct semantic drift quantification via GNNs prove noisy or computationally infeasible initially, we will pivot to a hybrid approach combining mutation-based perturbations restricted to the lexical and syntactic levels with proxy semantic preservation assessments using ensemble machine learning models trained on human expert-rated fidelity datasets across languages. This approach retains core mutation realism principles while leveraging supervised learning to approximate robustness. Furthermore, we will iteratively simplify mutation operators and refine knowledge graph scopes to optimize interpretability and reliability before full GNN integration, ensuring continuous progress and feasibility in metric development."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method introduces a novel analogy between AI-generated texts and genomes by applying mutation operators at lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels. However, the mechanism lacks sufficient clarity on how these controlled perturbations realistically model the kinds of errors or variations seen in cross-lingual scientific text generation. Specifically, the method should detail the design and calibration of mutation operators to ensure they reflect plausible linguistic mutations rather than arbitrary noise. Additionally, the approach to measuring semantic drift via domain-specific knowledge graphs needs elaboration: how will the system quantify fact preservation or distortion robustly across different scientific domains and languages? Strengthening this mechanism will boost the soundness of the project and clarify its technical feasibility and innovation edge in a competitive field. This clarification is critical before proceeding with experiments, as it underpins the metric’s reliability and interpretability, which are central to the contribution's novelty and impact potential. Targeted experiments should validate these mutation operators' realism and the semantics drift quantification method upfront to build confidence in the approach's soundness and utility.  Suggestions for supplementing this include clearer algorithmic definitions, possibly with preliminary case demonstrations in the proposal stage, and more precise descriptions of knowledge graph usage and alignment with scientific fact verification across languages and domains.  This detailed mechanism description is essential to address the reviewer's concerns and to distinguish this approach from existing perturbation or robustness evaluation methods in NLP and AI-generated text analysis literature.  Without it, the novelty and impact claims may be questioned in peer review and competitive presentation contexts.  Hence, the authors should address SOU-MECHANISM first to improve clarity, credibility, and foundational rigor before refining experiment plans or scaling further impact claims.  This is a critical foundation for the proposed metric suite's success and comparative advantage in the competitive space of multilingual fidelity evaluation metrics for scientific texts.  In summary, the innovator must clearly specify and justify the mutation and semantic drift measurement mechanisms to render the proposed fidelity metrics method sound, interpretable, and compelling for downstream adoption and evaluation tasks in multilingual scientific NLP contexts.  This targeted articulation will in turn enable more confident feasibility assessments and clearer impact demonstrations subsequently.  Thus, addressing this core methodological clarity issue is the highest priority action at this stage in the research idea’s development cycle for maximal downstream benefits and acceptance potential in premier venues.  This critique focuses on clarifying mechanism rationale and operational details in the Proposed_Method section to firmly ground the approach scientifically and technically."

          "feedback_content": "Given the idea's novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and its strong focus on fidelity metrics inspired by genetic mutation analogies, the project stands to gain considerable impact and distinctive novelty by integrating advances from globally linked concepts such as 'graph neural networks' and 'processes of language change.' Specifically, the authors could enhance their fidelity metric's semantic drift measurement by employing graph neural networks to model and track evolving semantic representations and linguistic mutations over 'generations of language users' or language change processes. This integration could powerfully capture subtle domain- and language-specific semantic shifts after perturbations and translations. Additionally, considering the 'structure of human language' and mechanisms of linguistic evolution embedded in the graph neural network architecture would provide a biologically and linguistically grounded refinement of mutation operators and robustness scores. By incorporating these state-of-the-art deep learning architectures and linguistic change theories, the project can sharpen its methodological novelty, improve fidelity estimation granularity, and broaden relevance from static mutation testing to dynamic language evolution simulations and analyses. Doing so would also directly address the challenge of evaluating underrepresented languages and scientific domains by leveraging cross-lingual graph structures and language user generations. Therefore, the innovator should consider extending their framework to fuse genetic mutation-inspired perturbations with graph neural network models and linguistic evolution insights. This global integration would differentiate the approach from existing robustness and fidelity metrics, enhancing competitiveness for premier venues like ACL or NeurIPS while delivering deeper scientific contributions and broader applicability. Implementing this suggestion naturally supports the project's soundness and feasibility goals by grounding mutations and semantic drift in robust, learned graph structures, enabling scalable evaluation with strong domain and language adaptability."
