    "title": "Integrating Organizational Behavioral Models with AI Text Generation for Scientific Collaboration",
    "Problem_Statement": "The intersection between AI-driven language models and organizational behavior in scientific institutions is underexplored, limiting the efficacy and adoption of AI tools in multilingual collaborative scientific communication.",
    "Motivation": "Directly addresses the external gap of cross-fertilization between AI, digital transformation, and organizational studies to foster trust, transparency, and systemic innovation in multilingual scientific workflows.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a hybrid framework combining computational organizational behavior models (capturing trust, collaboration dynamics) with AI language generation modules tailored for multilingual scientific discourse. The framework dynamically adapts AI output styles and feedback mechanisms based on real-time organizational culture metrics collected via IoT-enabled collaboration platforms, enabling human-AI co-creation optimized for each institution's unique communication ecosystem.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Deploy IoT sensors and software tools to monitor communication patterns in multilingual scientific teams. 2. Model organizational behavior metrics influencing trust and collaboration. 3. Develop an AI language generation engine that modulates tone, formality, and content presentation accordingly. 4. Pilot test in multilingual scientific institutions with pre-post measurement of collaboration efficacy, trust surveys, and communication quality. 5. Benchmark improvements against static AI-assisted communication systems.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Scientific team needs a project update in French adjusted for a hierarchical organization with formal communication norms. Expected Output: AI-generated update adhering to formal language conventions and inclusive of trust-building phrases aligned with organizational behavior models.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time monitoring is infeasible, substitute with qualitative organizational behavior surveys to parameterize AI adaptations. Also, test offline model simulations to iteratively refine AI output without IoT data."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan includes deploying IoT sensors and software tools to monitor communication patterns in multilingual scientific teams, which raises practical and ethical concerns. The feasibility of real-time IoT data collection regarding sensitive communication dynamics within scientific institutions requires further clarification on data privacy, consent, and sensor accuracy in diverse multilingual settings. Moreover, the plan lacks a clear methodology for integrating organizational behavior metrics with AI language generation in real time and for validating the effectiveness of such integration beyond qualitative surveys or offline simulations. It is essential to detail mitigation strategies for potential data collection constraints and to provide fallback technical workflows that still enable robust evaluation of the hybrid model under controlled or simulated conditions to ensure experimental soundness and feasibility. Enhancing the experiment plan with clearer validation steps, risk management, and ethical compliance details will strengthen credibility and practicability of the approach in targeted environments. This clarification should be addressed first to ensure the project can realistically progress and generate reliable results within the scientific collaboration context targeted by the proposal. Target this critique at the 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' section for refinement to demonstrate experimental feasibility and readiness to tackle deployment challenges effectively and ethically.  \n\n---\n\n\n"

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty has been assessed as competitive but not strongly novel, integrating concepts from the globally-linked areas such as 'Occupational Safety and Health' and 'healthy work environment' could substantially enhance the framework's impact and relevance. Specifically, by adapting the AI-driven organizational behavioral models to support psychosocial risk management and foster safe, healthy workplace communication environments in scientific institutions, the research could open new application domains beyond multilingual scientific collaboration alone. This cross-domain integration can promote wider adoption and address systemic innovation goals mentioned in the motivation, by also improving occupational wellbeing through AI-augmented communication tailored to stress, risk, and safety norms. Encouraging the authors to explore this linkage as a parallel use case or evaluation dimension could boost both novelty and societal impact. This suggestion targets the overall concept and motivation sections to encourage broader domain integration and higher-level innovation leveraging synergies with occupational health and safety challenges that align with institutional collaboration dynamics."
