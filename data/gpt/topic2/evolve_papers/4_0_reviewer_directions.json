    "title": "AI-Healthcare Cross-Domain Concept Validation Framework",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of robust, domain-general frameworks to validate the accuracy, bias, and ethical compliance of language model outputs when modeling human concepts, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance. This gap limits trust and applicability.",
    "Motivation": "This project addresses the external gap of underexplored cross-disciplinary integration with healthcare and biomedical informatics in language model validation, as well as the lack of validated evaluation frameworks. It transforms the innovation opportunity of cross-domain validation frameworks by explicitly combining healthcare implementation science and software engineering best practices for testing.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose designing a hybrid participatory validation framework that integrates software engineering test methodologies (unit/integration testing analogues for LMs), biomedical informatics clinical trial validation concepts, and participatory human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms. This framework will incorporate domain-specific ethical and bias audits and support transparent report generation to measure conceptual output quality across finance and healthcare tasks.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate datasets and benchmark tasks from healthcare (e.g., genetic testing interpretative reports) and finance (e.g., risk assessment narratives).\n2) Develop and integrate modular testing components adapted from software engineering (test coverage, mutation testing analogs).\n3) Implement participatory evaluation sessions with domain experts.\n4) Assess bias and ethical compliance using newly defined metrics.\n5) Compare evaluation outcomes with standard testing approaches.\n6) Iterate framework refinements based on outcomes and expert feedback.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "'Input: Generate a patient-friendly explanation of genetic test results for BRCA1 mutation risk.\nExpected Output: Accurate, jargon-minimized, bias-free explanation that respects privacy and includes recommended follow-ups, validated by participatory tests and ethical audits.'",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct integration proves infeasible, fallback to isolated domain-specific validation prototypes (healthcare-only) and incrementally add finance domain elements. Alternatively, develop simulation environments to prototype participatory feedback virtually before human trials."
