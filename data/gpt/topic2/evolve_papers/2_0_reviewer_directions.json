    "title": "Cross-Cultural AI Explanation Fabric for Scientific Texts",
    "Problem_Statement": "AI-generated scientific texts often lack culturally aware explanations that ensure clarity and trustworthiness across diverse multilingual audiences, leading to misinterpretations and reduced adoption of AI tools in global research communities.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of ethical use and quality assurance in multilingual scientific texts by embedding culturally aware, participatory explanatory mechanisms inspired by implementation science and participatory co-design from health services research.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a modular cross-cultural explanatory fabric integrated into language models that generates layered scientific explanations tailored to the cultural norms and linguistic nuances of target audiences. The fabric uses co-designed cultural context embeddings derived from participatory sessions with multilingual scientists, interpreters, and ethicists, coupled with adaptive content tuning applying ethics-aware filters to balance scientific rigor with cultural relevance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multilingual scientific articles with annotations on cultural communication preferences from target language communities. 2. Conduct participatory workshops with multilingual scientists and interpreters to extract cultural context embeddings. 3. Integrate these embeddings into a transformer-based language model fine-tuned on domain-specific scientific texts. 4. Evaluate explanatory clarity and cultural appropriateness via surveys and comprehension tests with multilingual participants. 5. Benchmark against baseline AI explanations without cultural embedding using metrics like BLEU, factual accuracy, and user trust ratings.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI-generated summary of a biomedical research paper in Japanese scientific publication context. Expected Output: Culturally tailored explanation that highlights key terms with analogies familiar in Japanese biomedical research practices and avoids culturally sensitive phrases, enhancing comprehension and trust.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If participation-based cultural embeddings prove insufficient, fallback to automated cultural context identification using unsupervised clustering of large multilingual corpora and lexicon analysis. Alternatively, incorporate a human-in-the-loop verification step to refine explanations."

          "feedback_content": "The experiment plan involves multiple complex steps such as collecting culturally annotated multilingual scientific articles, conducting participatory workshops, and integrating co-designed cultural context embeddings. However, the plan lacks clear detail on how cultural preferences will be systematically identified, quantified, and embedded in a way that is computationally tractable. Step 2 (participatory workshops) may present scalability and reproducibility challenges across diverse cultures and languages. Additionally, evaluation methods relying heavily on surveys and comprehension tests may suffer from subjective biases unless carefully designed with validated instruments and sufficient participant diversity. Incorporating pilot studies or proof-of-concept validations earlier in the plan could increase feasibility and allow iterative refinement before full-scale benchmarking. More specifics on data volume requirements, participant recruitment, and integration techniques within the transformer model would strengthen feasibility confidence. Please clarify and fortify these areas in the experiment plan to ensure practical implementation and reproducible results. This is critical because without solid experimental grounding, the effectiveness of the explanatory fabric cannot be convincingly demonstrated, limiting the work's impact and acceptance in the field.\n\nRecommendation: Refine the experiment plan to include detailed protocols for cultural embedding extraction, strategies for handling cultural variability, scalable data collection methods, and objective multimodal evaluation metrics to bolster practical feasibility and scientific rigor.\n\n--- Target Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment indicating a highly competitive area, the proposal could significantly strengthen its impact and innovation by integrating concepts from the 'Globally-Linked Concepts' list, especially drawing from 'adaptive learning systems' and 'cognitive load theory'. For instance, embedding dynamic cognitive load adjustment mechanisms informed by cultural communication norms could make explanations not only culturally relevant but also optimized for learning efficacy and comprehension. Moreover, aligning the framework with established public health communication principles and health equity can broaden applicability beyond scientific texts to benefit palliative care, public health emergency scenarios, and multidisciplinary health communication settings. Integrating qualified medical interpreters and palliative care professionals into participatory co-design could ground the cultural embeddings in clinically impactful domains, enhancing trust and adoption. Such global integration would also diversify the idea's applicability and push the novelty beyond existing language adaptation and explanation systems.\n\nRecommendation: Expand the methodology to incorporate adaptive learning theories and public health communication frameworks, engaging domain-specific professionals to co-create culturally aware explanations with measurable learning and trust outcomes. This global integration would elevate novelty, feasibility, and impact, addressing the narrowness and competition currently limiting this work.\n\n--- Target Section: Proposed_Method"
