    "title": "Hybrid Human-AI Legal Creativity Attribution Model",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current AI-generated content lacks clear legal and ethical frameworks to define ownership, originality, and human-AI contribution thresholds, complicating attribution and copyright enforcement.",
    "Motivation": "This addresses the internal gap regarding contested AI content originality and the absence of normative frameworks, connecting anthropology, computer science, and copyright law to innovate legitimacy models for AI-human collaborative creativity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose the creation of a hybrid computational-legal model that quantitatively estimates human intervention in AI-assisted concept formation using metadata tracking, interaction logs, and output semantic novelty scores combined with legal norms and anthropological theories about creativity thresholds. This model will be formalized as a set of interpretable criteria for ownership attribution, supporting automated confidence scoring and dispute resolution integration.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets of human-AI collaboratively generated concepts with detailed interaction records.\n2) Develop semantic novelty and human effort metrics based on log data.\n3) Collaborate with legal scholars to define normative thresholds.\n4) Train interpretable classifiers to predict originality attribution.\n5) Validate against legal case studies and expert panels.\n6) Deploy prototype attribution tool in creative workflows for feedback.",

        "title": "Hybrid Human-AI Legal Creativity Attribution Model with Formalized Mechanisms and Feasible Interdisciplinary Implementation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current AI-generated content challenges traditional notions of authorship and ownership due to unclear legal and ethical standards distinguishing human from AI contributions. This lack of clear frameworks complicates attribution, IP rights allocation, and copyright enforcement in collaborative AI-human creative contexts, exacerbating legal and normative uncertainties in intellectual property law for AI-generated works.",
        "Motivation": "Despite emerging legal debates around AI-generated works and evolving intellectual property frameworks, there remains a competitive landscape of approaches lacking rigorous formalization and practical interpretability for diverse stakeholders. This project uniquely bridges computer science, socio-legal studies, and anthropology to develop a transparent, mathematically grounded attribution model that not only quantifies human contributions but also operationalizes normative creativity thresholds drawn from American copyright law and socio-legal judgments. By advancing an interpretable hybrid model that integrates interaction metadata with legal norms, this research exceeds prior conceptual efforts and offers a novel, practical solution tailored to the judicial decision-making process and public interest in the allocation of rights for AI-human collaborative creativity.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We introduce a formal hybrid computational-legal framework combining quantitative metrics with normative thresholds to operationalize authorship attribution in AI-assisted creations. Core components include: (1) A mathematically defined Attribution Score AS = w1*HM + w2*SNM + w3*LN, where HM is a normalized Human-Machine interaction metric derived from fine-grained metadata (e.g., edit frequency, timing, semantic edits quantified via change embeddings), SNM is a Semantic Novelty Metric measuring incremental originality using embedding-based distance and information theoretic measures, and LN is a Legal Norm Compliance score encoding anthropological and IP law thresholds mapped onto scalar indicators. Weights (w1,w2,w3) are trained via interpretable models such as Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) ensuring transparency. (2) Interpretability is ensured by decomposing the model contributions and providing legal and non-technical visual explanations contextualized for IP rights analysis and judicial reasoning, fostering trust among creators, legal professionals, and policy-makers. (3) A formal integration module translates AS into confidence scores aligned with documented case law and statutory authorship concepts (e.g., \"originality,\" \"human authorship\"), enabling automated yet legally coherent ownership attribution and dispute resolution support. (4) This approach innovatively embeds socio-legal concepts like \"meaning-making\" and the \"concept of authorship\" into computational routines to systematically reflect the complexities of intellectual property frameworks in relation to AI creativity and human input.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Acquisition: Partner with creative industry collaborators and legal institutions to collect a multi-domain dataset of AI-assisted creations with comprehensive interaction logs and human edits. Implement strict ethical protocols addressing privacy and proprietary concerns, including anonymization and consent mechanisms. Target a scalable dataset of >500 multimodal collaborative instances. 2) Metric Development: Develop and formalize HM and SNM metrics by analyzing interaction sequences and semantic changes using advanced NLP embedding techniques and time-series analysis. 3) Legal Collaboration: Establish an iterative interdisciplinary working group including IP scholars, anthropologists, and judicial experts to translate legal norms and case precedents into quantifiable LN parameters and define normative attribution thresholds. 4) Model Training: Employ interpretable machine learning models (e.g., GAMs) integrating HM, SNM, and LN to derive Attribution Scores. Validate interpretability via stakeholder workshops ensuring usability for non-legal experts in judicial decision-making. 5) Validation: Test the model against curated legal case studies of AI-generated works and collect expert panel assessments to benchmark alignment with existing intellectual property judgments and authorship decisions. 6) Deployment: Build prototype attribution tools integrated within creative workflows, enabling real-time attribution confidence visualization and feedback harvesting for iterative refinement. 7) Timeline and Roles: Phase 1 (6 months) data & metric development; Phase 2 (6 months) interdisciplinary norm formalization; Phase 3 (6 months) model training & validation; Phase 4 (6 months) deployment & feedback; involving CS researchers, legal scholars, anthropologists, and industry partners.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An AI-assisted design workflow generating a logo where the creator made 30 incremental edits over a 2-hour session, recorded with timestamps and edit types; semantic analysis detects a 35% novel conceptual divergence from base AI outputs. Legal norms suggest a 25% minimal originality threshold for human contribution. Expected Output: Attribution Confidence Score = 0.82, decomposed as HM=0.7 (high human activity), SNM=0.65 (moderate semantic novelty), LN=0.95 (meets legal thresholds), resulting in interpretable ownership allocation strongly favoring human co-authorship, aligned with American copyright principles and supporting dispute adjudication. This output is accompanied by visual explanations suitable for non-lawyer stakeholders illustrating which metric contributed most and how legal criteria were satisfied.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should comprehensive interaction-log dataset acquisition prove too resource-intensive, we will pivot to controlled experimental user studies simulating human-AI collaboration with synthetic yet realistic interaction data, supplemented by qualitative interviews to validate model assumptions. Additionally, we will develop standalone interpretability visualization tools mapping human-AI interaction patterns onto legal concept spaces to support human adjudicators in attribution judgments, fostering incremental domain adoption and feedback collection for iterative model refinement."

However, the mechanism for quantifying human intervention and creativity thresholds is underspecified — it is unclear how semantic novelty scores and interaction logs concretely translate to interpretable ownership attribution criteria and confidence scores. Clarify how these diverse data sources and normative concepts will combine mathematically or algorithmically, and how interpretability will be ensured for legal and non-technical stakeholders. Providing a preliminary framework or example formalization would strengthen confidence in the soundness of the approach and feasibility of the model’s interpretability and legal integration components. Please address this to ensure the core methodological mechanism is transparent and convincing, not just aspirational or conceptual, especially given the complex multidomain integration required in this high-stakes attribution context. This clarity is critical for assessing the validity of the approach and its prospects for adoption in legal environments and scholarly discourse, beyond a theoretical proposal.

However, feasibility concerns arise around the availability and scale of datasets with detailed human-AI interaction logs and legally annotated creativity attributions, which are essential for training and validating the model. Collecting such rich data may be highly resource-intensive, and the plan lacks fallback specifics for data scarcity beyond pivoting to user studies and interpretability tools. Further, the integration of legal normative thresholds and quantitative metrics requires interdisciplinary iterative refinement, which is only briefly acknowledged. Provide more detail on data acquisition strategies, scale expectations, collaborator roles, and timelines. Also, consider potential ethical, privacy, or proprietary issues in recording detailed human-AI creative collaboration logs. Strengthening these aspects will increase confidence that the ambitious experimental plan is realistically executable, particularly in the highly interdisciplinary context combining CS, law, and anthropology.
