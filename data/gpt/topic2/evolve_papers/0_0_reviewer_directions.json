    "title": "Neuro-Semantic Cognitive Interpretability for Language Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current interpretability methods for language models often fail to capture human-like cognitive processes reflected in neural representational geometry and semantic priming phenomena, limiting cognitive plausibility and explanatory power.",
    "Motivation": "This project addresses the internal gap around lack of cognitive plausibility and the external gap connecting semantic hierarchies with cognitive representations. By integrating insights from neuroscience, psychology, and AI interpretability, the method aims to ground explanations in cognitive science evidence, greatly expanding beyond current domain-agnostic XAI approaches.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid interpretability framework combining representational similarity analysis (RSA) between language model activations and human brain imaging data with semantic priming-inspired contextual modulation of explanations. The approach will fuse fMRI-informed neural representational spaces with lexical semantic hierarchies (e.g., WordNet) to generate explanations that reveal which latent concepts and brain-like representations the model prioritizes per prediction, dynamically contextualized by semantic priming effects measured in human behavioral studies.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets combining language input, human fMRI responses (e.g., from published datasets), and semantic priming behavioral metrics. 2) Extract language model activations (GPT, BERT) for the same inputs. 3) Compute RSA between model and neural representations to identify aligned cognitive subspaces. 4) Integrate lexical ontologies to link these subspaces to semantic categories. 5) Develop explanation algorithms that highlight model components with high RSA scores modulated by priming context. 6) Evaluate using cognitive plausibility metrics, human judgment agreement, and standard interpretability benchmarks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence ‘The cat chased the mouse.’ Context primed by ‘animal predator’. Expected output: Explanation highlighting model focus on 'animal behavior' latent dimensions consistent with human neural patterns and behavioral priming effects, showing enhanced interpretability grounded in cognitive science.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct RSA with fMRI data is inconclusive, fallback to using behavioral priming effect sizes and reaction times to proxy cognitive representations. Alternatively, utilize EEG datasets or simulate neural geometry through cognitive computational models to inform interpretability."

          "feedback_content": "The experiment plan hinges on successfully combining fMRI data, semantic priming behavioral metrics, and LLM activations, which is ambitious but under-specified in practical integration details. Public fMRI datasets often vary in task design, population, and stimulus sets, which may not align straightforwardly with available semantic priming metrics or lexical ontologies. Clarify how you will harmonize stimuli and participant contexts across neuroscience and behavioral datasets to ensure meaningful representational similarity analysis (RSA). Additionally, fMRI’s low temporal resolution challenges correlating neural geometry with dynamic semantic priming effects, so the fallback plan mentioning EEG and computational models should be elaborated with concrete alternative pipelines or metrics. Providing timeline and resource assessments for these complex multimodal steps will also enhance feasibility understanding. Overall, a more detailed data integration and validation strategy is needed to confirm the experiment plan can rigorously test the cognitive interpretability hypotheses proposed, thereby strengthening your submission’s empirical viability and credibility in a competitive space of multimodal interpretability studies. \n\nSuggestions include pilot analyses focusing on a subset of well-aligned stimuli across datasets, or specifying candidate public datasets with compatible semantic priming tasks to demonstrate initial feasibility before full-scale experiments.—target section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "To enhance novelty and impact in this competitive space, integrating insights from the globally-linked concept of 'speech comprehension,' particularly from the perspective of 'human speech comprehension' and modeling 'speaker’s intended meaning,' can broaden the scope towards pragmatic language understanding—a critical and complex cognitive function. Incorporate representational similarity analyses not only for isolated semantic categories but also for contextualized utterance-level interpretations reflecting speaker intent, leveraging bilateral brain region activation patterns documented in neuroscience literature. This addition could ground explanations in more nuanced cognitive processes involving discourse and intention recognition, augmenting alignment with complex cognitive processes beyond lexical semantics. Furthermore, exploring deep generative models or convolutional neural networks specialized in speech or face-processing networks (for multimodal grounded context) can enrich the interpretability framework with biologically and cognitively plausible architectures. Such integration will differentiate your approach by bridging fine-grained representational geometry with communicative intent and multimodal cognition, increasing the impact and widening applicability while addressing novelty concerns flagged in the competitive review.—target section: Overall Concept and Proposed_Method"
