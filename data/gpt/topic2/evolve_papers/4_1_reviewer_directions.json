    "title": "Hybrid Human-AI Legal Creativity Attribution Model",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current AI-generated content lacks clear legal and ethical frameworks to define ownership, originality, and human-AI contribution thresholds, complicating attribution and copyright enforcement.",
    "Motivation": "This addresses the internal gap regarding contested AI content originality and the absence of normative frameworks, connecting anthropology, computer science, and copyright law to innovate legitimacy models for AI-human collaborative creativity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose the creation of a hybrid computational-legal model that quantitatively estimates human intervention in AI-assisted concept formation using metadata tracking, interaction logs, and output semantic novelty scores combined with legal norms and anthropological theories about creativity thresholds. This model will be formalized as a set of interpretable criteria for ownership attribution, supporting automated confidence scoring and dispute resolution integration.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets of human-AI collaboratively generated concepts with detailed interaction records.\n2) Develop semantic novelty and human effort metrics based on log data.\n3) Collaborate with legal scholars to define normative thresholds.\n4) Train interpretable classifiers to predict originality attribution.\n5) Validate against legal case studies and expert panels.\n6) Deploy prototype attribution tool in creative workflows for feedback.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "'Input: AI-assisted marketing slogan generation with recorded human edits.\nExpected Output: Attribution confidence of 80% human originality based on interaction logs and semantic uniqueness metrics, aligned with proposed legal norms.'",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If computational metrics underperform, pivot to qualitative user studies to refine hypotheses or focus on interpretability tools that visualize human-AI interaction patterns to aid human judgment."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an ambitious hybrid computational-legal model integrating metadata tracking, semantic novelty, and legal/anthropological norms. However, the mechanism for quantifying human intervention and creativity thresholds is underspecified — it is unclear how semantic novelty scores and interaction logs concretely translate to interpretable ownership attribution criteria and confidence scores. Clarify how these diverse data sources and normative concepts will combine mathematically or algorithmically, and how interpretability will be ensured for legal and non-technical stakeholders. Providing a preliminary framework or example formalization would strengthen confidence in the soundness of the approach and feasibility of the model’s interpretability and legal integration components. Please address this to ensure the core methodological mechanism is transparent and convincing, not just aspirational or conceptual, especially given the complex multidomain integration required in this high-stakes attribution context. This clarity is critical for assessing the validity of the approach and its prospects for adoption in legal environments and scholarly discourse, beyond a theoretical proposal.

However, feasibility concerns arise around the availability and scale of datasets with detailed human-AI interaction logs and legally annotated creativity attributions, which are essential for training and validating the model. Collecting such rich data may be highly resource-intensive, and the plan lacks fallback specifics for data scarcity beyond pivoting to user studies and interpretability tools. Further, the integration of legal normative thresholds and quantitative metrics requires interdisciplinary iterative refinement, which is only briefly acknowledged. Provide more detail on data acquisition strategies, scale expectations, collaborator roles, and timelines. Also, consider potential ethical, privacy, or proprietary issues in recording detailed human-AI creative collaboration logs. Strengthening these aspects will increase confidence that the ambitious experimental plan is realistically executable, particularly in the highly interdisciplinary context combining CS, law, and anthropology.
