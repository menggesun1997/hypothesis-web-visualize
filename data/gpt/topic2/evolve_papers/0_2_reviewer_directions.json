    "title": "User-Adaptive Multi-Level Explanation Framework via Semi-Supervised Cognitive Profiling",
    "Problem_Statement": "Interpretability solutions often present generic, non-tailored explanations that fail to adapt to diverse user expertise and cognitive styles, reducing trustworthiness and usability across cognitive science and AI applications.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by the opportunity to design minimal supervision-based user-centric explanatory systems, this project targets the gap in explanation personalization by exploiting semi-supervised learning to model user cognitive profiles dynamically, enabling multi-level explanations adapting to user needs and background.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a multi-tier explanation system that learns user cognitive style vectors via minimal interaction, using semi-supervised clustering on sparse data (questionnaires, interaction patterns). The system then dynamically adapts language model explanation granularity and format accordingly (e.g., visual vs textual, technical depth), leveraging reinforcement learning on user feedback signals to optimize interpretability alignment with individual cognitive preferences.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Recruit diverse users with varied backgrounds in cognitive science and AI. 2) Collect sparse user interaction data and explicit feedback on explanatory styles. 3) Train semi-supervised models to infer cognitive profiles. 4) Integrate profile-conditioned explanation generators with transformer interpretability modules. 5) Evaluate user satisfaction, comprehension, and trust metrics across baseline generic explanation models and the adaptive system.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Model prediction explanation of sentiment analysis as visual concept graph for expert cognitive scientist vs simplified metaphorical analogy for lay user, showing tailored explanation generated from learned profile.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If user profiling is insufficient from sparse data, incorporate transfer learning from larger cognitive style datasets. Alternatively, enable manual user selection of explanation type as a fallback."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method conceptually integrates semi-supervised clustering, cognitive profiling, and reinforcement learning to adapt explanations, but the mechanism lacks detailed clarity on key interactions. Specifically, how are sparse user data reliably transformed into stable cognitive style vectors? How are these vectors operationalized concretely to condition explanation generation within transformer interpretability modules? The explanation of reinforcement learning's role is also high-level without specifying reward signals or learning dynamics. To enhance soundness, delineate the exact data flow, model architecture, and reinforcement learning framework with clear formalization or algorithmic steps, ensuring that each component's role is logically justified and technically feasible with sparse data inputs and minimal supervision. This depth is essential given the complexity of dynamically adapting explanations for diverse cognitive styles in real time, mitigating risks of overfitting or misprofiling users due to sparse interactions or noisy feedback signals, which currently remains a critical ambiguity in your proposal's core mechanism, thus undermining overall credibility and reproducibility."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and existing strong links between core components, you would significantly boost the proposalâ€™s impact and distinctiveness by integrating concepts from 'educational data mining' and 'intelligent tutoring systems' within your adaptive explanation framework. Specifically, consider leveraging cognitive profiling methods and reinforcement learning approaches from dialogue-based tutoring systems or student modeling research to refine user-adaptive explanations dynamically. Additionally, incorporating transfer learning techniques from educational data mining could enhance sparse data scenarios by using pre-trained models of user cognitive styles from Open Online Courses or tutoring platforms. This cross-domain integration not only strengthens methodological grounding but opens pathways to broader applications in personalized learning and AI-assisted education technologies, thereby addressing both feasibility challenges and broadening impact beyond generic AI interpretability towards real-world intelligent tutoring and educational settings."
