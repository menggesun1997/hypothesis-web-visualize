    "Motivation": "Addressing the internal gap of inconsistent benchmarks and fragmented evaluation, this project proposes a novel benchmark suite combining RSA-driven neural data alignment and semantic ontology taxonomy coverage to systematically assess interpretability methods' cognitive fidelity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a benchmark dataset containing aligned natural language inputs, cognitive neuroscience datasets (e.g., fMRI activations), and detailed semantic ontology annotations. Evaluate interpretability methods by quantifying RSA alignment scores between model and brain activations, alongside ontology-based metrics measuring explanation semantic coherence and hierarchy-consistency.

        "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluation of language model interpretability is fragmented by heterogeneous metrics and lacks comprehensive, cognitively grounded benchmarks that integrate neural representational similarity, semantic ontology alignment, and scalable multimodal data for robust, cross-domain assessment.",
        "Motivation": "Existing interpretability benchmarks are narrow in scope, impeding standardized, reproducible evaluation and limiting insights into models’ cognitive fidelity. This project addresses the NOV-COMPETITIVE landscape by innovatively combining representational similarity analysis (RSA) of neural data, semantic ontology taxonomy coherence, and transfer learning with multimodal cognitive datasets. Leveraging computational collective intelligence for scalable annotations and validation, this approach transcends language-only models to enable adaptive, robust benchmarks applicable across AI domains such as vision and multimodal systems, thus significantly enhancing interpretability evaluation’s impact and adoption.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel, scalable benchmark framework that: (1) aligns diverse natural language and vision stimuli with neural activation data (fMRI, MEG), enriched with detailed semantic ontology annotations curated via computational collective intelligence platforms; (2) incorporates transfer learning techniques to leverage pretrained multimodal deep neural network architectures, enabling cross-task and cross-modal reinterpretation of representational geometries; (3) develops hybrid evaluation metrics combining RSA alignment scores for neural plausibility with ontology-based semantic coherence and hierarchy-consistency, extended to multimodal semantic segmentation and scene classification tasks; and (4) integrates continuous community-driven annotation validation and benchmark expansion via social computing systems. This multifaceted, adaptive approach ensures broader applicability, scalability, and cognitive relevance beyond prior benchmarks.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Conduct feasibility and scalability pilot studies using existing public multimodal datasets (e.g., Language-Driven fMRI, Natural Scenes fMRI, and associated ontologies) to prototype data harmonization pipelines and annotation consistency checks;\n2) Develop tools for dataset harmonization addressing annotation schema alignment, modality-specific preprocessing, and validation of neural and semantic data integration;\n3) Implement baseline interpretability methods producing explanations for language and vision tasks;\n4) Evaluate methods using hybrid RSA and semantic ontology metrics, validating metric reliability and reproducibility on pilot data;\n5) Iteratively refine dataset curation and metric computation protocols informed by pilot results;\n6) Scale benchmark release with comprehensive documentation, tools, and a leaderboard platform facilitating continuous community contribution and collective intelligence-driven ontology annotation enhancements;\n7) Extend benchmark scope progressively via transfer learning experiments across multimodal models and tasks, ensuring adaptation of evaluation metrics and data harmonization frameworks;",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence 'Birds can fly.' paired with corresponding natural scene image stimuli and fMRI recordings capturing visual and language processing areas including the occipital place area. Ontology annotations cover bird taxonomy and flying-related semantic hierarchy. Expected evaluation: Interpretability methods demonstrating high RSA alignment with bird-related neural patterns in both language and vision cortices and explanations consistently traversing semantic hierarchies in the ontology receive superior hybrid scores, demonstrating cross-modal cognitive fidelity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If large-scale aligned neuroscience and multimodal datasets prove scarce or heterogeneous beyond harmonization feasibility, advance fallback strategies including synthesizing behavioral similarity datasets and simulated neural activation models tailored for multimodal stimuli. Expand computational collective intelligence platforms to bootstrap annotation coverage and quality with active learning. Also, incrementally narrow benchmark scope to high-quality subsets with intensive expert curation, ensuring maintainable rigor while scaling through transfer learning and domain adaptation frameworks."

Collecting and aligning fMRI data with detailed ontologies requires expert curation and potentially new data collection, which may challenge practicality and timeline. The plan should explicitly address data heterogeneity, potential scarcity of large-scale aligned brain-neural-ontology datasets, and propose clearer risk mitigation strategies beyond the fallback plan, such as piloting limited prototypes or leveraging existing public multimodal datasets to validate feasibility before full-scale development. Without these details, the experimental plan risks being overly optimistic regarding execution feasibility and reproducibility of results at scale, which is critical for benchmark adoption and leaderboard establishment. A more robust feasibility analysis or preliminary empirical validation would strengthen confidence in the approach’s practicality and eventual impact on standardizing interpretability evaluation frameworks.  \n\nRecommendation: Include explicit plans for dataset harmonization, annotation consistency checks, and validation of metric reliability on pilot data to ensure the experimental pipeline is feasible and scalable for community use within a realistic timeframe and resource envelope.  \n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "Given that this work is labeled as NOV-COMPETITIVE and involves representational similarity analysis (RSA) and semantic ontologies for interpretability benchmarking, a critical way to boost its impact and novelty is to integrate state-of-the-art insights and methods from related fields highlighted in globally-linked concepts. In particular, incorporating transfer learning techniques common in deep neural network architectures or leveraging computational collective intelligence approaches could enable scalable and adaptive interpretability benchmarks. Additionally, linking the benchmark to computer vision tasks (e.g., scene classification or semantic segmentation) could broaden its applicability beyond language models to multimodal architectures. Such integration can help generalize the benchmark’s relevance, demonstrate cross-modal cognitive fidelity, and encourage adoption across AI domains, thereby distinguishing this work from existing evaluation methods. \n\nRecommendation: Expand the scope to include transfer learning paradigms and multimodal cognitive data; possibly incorporate collective intelligence platforms for crowd-sourcing ontology annotations or benchmarking interpretability methods, which would add novelty and practical impact beyond current niche focus. This also aligns with advancing intelligent computing techniques and applications in social computing systems, increasing the research’s reach and competitiveness at premier venues.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
