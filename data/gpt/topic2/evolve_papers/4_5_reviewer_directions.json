    "title": "Generalizable Testing Framework for Ethical Bias in Private-Data Language Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "No validated, domain-general frameworks exist for systematically assessing and mitigating ethical bias arising from private, proprietary training data in language models, particularly relevant to sensitive decision-making contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Directly addressing internal limitations in bias assessment from private data and extending high-potential opportunities related to ethical AI usage, this project creates domain-agnostic evaluation protocols combining ethical theory and quantitative bias measures.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular bias testing framework that dynamically constructs test inputs reflecting protected attributes and private data sensitivity scenarios, applies intersectional bias metrics, and provides actionable mitigation suggestions (e.g., data augmentation or model fine-tuning) guided by ethical AI principles. The framework will be customizable for finance, healthcare, and IT contexts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Aggregate datasets with annotated protected attributes.\n2) Design test input generation scripts simulating private data scenarios.\n3) Apply and benchmark bias metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds).\n4) Implement mitigation strategies and evaluate effectiveness.\n5) Collaborate with ethicists for principled guidance.\n6) Validate framework's generalizability across domains.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "'Input: Generate credit risk assessment summaries with simulated minority demographic data.\nExpected Output: Identification of any disparate impact in outputs and recommended debiasing actions to ensure fairness compliance.'",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If mitigation techniques reduce model utility too much, fallback to post-processing output filters or hybrid human review systems to balance fairness and performance."
