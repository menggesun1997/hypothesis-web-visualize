    "title": "Commonsense Knowledge Graph-Augmented Contrastive Learning for Mechanistic Language Model Explanations",
    "Problem_Statement": "Mechanistic interpretability misses integration of structured commonsense knowledge that could explain model's internal decision paths.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the external gap around commonsense integration by embedding triples from commonsense knowledge graphs within contrastive learning objectives to encourage mechanistic alignment between LM internal states and human-understood commonsense reasoning.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Augment contrastive pairs with commonsense triples as supervision, forcing the LM to associate representations reflecting relational facts and causal chains. Use a multi-head attention mechanism emphasizing these triples during training, aligning mechanistic insights with commonsense logic.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Extract relevant triples from ConceptNet; 2) Generate contrastive pairs incorporating commonsense relations; 3) Train LM with enhanced contrastive loss; 4) Evaluate interpretability via reasoning benchmark tasks; 5) Visualize activation patterns corresponding to commonsense chains.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Text \"The ice melted because it was warm\" with related commonsense triple (ice, melts, warm); Expected Output: Model articulation of mechanistic pathways linking premise and effect correlating with commonsense knowledge display.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If triple incorporation reduces model performance, fallback to embedding regularization with commonsense embeddings as soft constraints rather than hard contrastive samples."

          "feedback_content": "While the approach of augmenting contrastive learning with commonsense triples is innovative, the proposal lacks detailed clarity on how the multi-head attention mechanism will specifically incorporate and emphasize relational triples during training. It is critical to explicitly define the architecture changes, the normalization and weighting strategies for triples within attention heads, and how alignment between LM internal states and commonsense reasoning is quantitatively measured. Without this, the soundness of the proposed method cannot be fully assessed. I recommend including a clear technical diagram or pseudo-code and specifying the objective components relating to commonsense integration, to strengthen the proposal's internal coherence and reproducibility potential, which are essential for soundness assessment in mechanistic interpretability research. This elaboration will also guide effective experiment design and fair evaluation metrics later on. Target this enhancement first to bolster the method's credibility and subsequent feasibility evaluation."

          "feedback_content": "Given the idea was rated as highly competitive in terms of novelty, a strong way to enhance impact and differentiate the work is to integrate it with recent advances in neural-symbolic AI or logical reasoning frameworks, such as coupling the mechanistic interpretability outputs with neural-symbolic knowledge base completion or neuro-symbolic question answering. For example, one could incorporate outputs from the commonsense-augmented model as symbolic constraints or interpretable predicates in downstream AI reasoning tasks, thus providing not only explanations but actionable symbolic reasoning capabilities. This could elevate the work from an interpretability aid to a hybrid reasoning system contributing to artificial general intelligence research lines, offering broader and deeper impact across multiple linked fields including neural computation and AI reasoning. This systemic integration leverages the globally-linked concepts list and can also boost novelty beyond competitive baselines."
