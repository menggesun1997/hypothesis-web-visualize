    "title": "Semantic Path-Based Contrastive Learning for Fine-Grained Mechanistic Analysis in Language Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current contrastive learning approaches inadequately leverage semantic path distances in ontologies to produce fine-grained mechanistic interpretations beyond coarse category matching.",
    "Motivation": "Responding to the internal gap of limited domain-specific interpretability frameworks, this idea proposes encoding semantic path lengths within WordNet as continuous contrastive weighting to guide language models toward detailed mechanistic representations mirroring graded semantic relationships.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a contrastive loss function that weights positive and negative pairs by semantic path distance between concepts in WordNet, creating a smooth supervision signal reflecting ontology structure. Integrate this loss into the embedding space of language models to expose mechanistic structures capturing nuanced semantic proximity.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Prepare text corpora with WordNet tags; 2) Compute semantic path distances for pair sampling; 3) Train language model embeddings with weighted contrastive loss; 4) Compare interpretability against unweighted methods; 5) Evaluate on downstream tasks requiring semantic nuance (e.g., paraphrase detection).",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentences \"The wolf howled\" and \"The dog barked\" with semantic distance small but non-zero; Expected Output: Embeddings show proportional similarity reflecting approximate relation, showcasing mechanistic insight at finer granularity.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If path-weighted loss causes optimization issues, consider discretizing distances into bins or use attention mechanisms to dynamically learn weighting schemes."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method hinges on weighting pairs by continuous semantic path distances in WordNet for contrastive loss, but the proposal lacks clarity on how these continuous distances will integrate mathematically and be optimized alongside standard embedding objectives. The treatment of potential gradient instability or imbalance in positive-negative sampling due to dense weighting is not sufficiently detailed. You should explicitly formalize the loss function, explain how semantic path distances map to weight scalars (e.g., inverse, exponential decay), and discuss optimization stability, perhaps with preliminary theoretical or empirical support to confirm soundness of this core mechanism and avoid training collapse or trivial solutions. Clarity here is crucial to validate the approach's soundness and implementation feasibility in large language models embedding spaces without disrupting convergence or expressiveness of representations. Addressing these points will strengthen conceptual rigor and practical viability of the mechanism before experiments proceed. This detail is missing from the current Proposed_Method section and should be added to ground the contribution convincingly."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines standard steps such as preparing WordNet-tagged corpora, computing semantic path distances, and training with weighted contrastive loss, but it lacks concrete evaluation metrics and baselines that would convincingly measure improvement in fine-grained mechanistic interpretability. Specifically, 'compare interpretability against unweighted methods' is too vague â€” you should specify quantitative interpretability metrics or probing tasks, e.g., how you will operationalize 'mechanistic insight' or graded semantic proximity in embedding space similarity tests or downstream task performance (paraphrase detection is mentioned but needs detailed benchmarks and ablation studies). Furthermore, possible computational challenges and scalability (especially for integrating semantic distances at scale) are not addressed. Refinement of the experiment plan to specify evaluation criteria, dataset selection, ablation studies, and fallback triggers will improve feasibility and ensure results are meaningful and reproducible."
