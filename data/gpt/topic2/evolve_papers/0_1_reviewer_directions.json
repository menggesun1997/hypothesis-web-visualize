    "title": "Commonsense Knowledge Graph Integration for Disambiguation in Language Model Interpretability",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing language model interpretability techniques lack incorporation of structured commonsense knowledge, limiting their ability to explain ambiguous or context-dependent language understanding in a cognitively plausible manner.",
    "Motivation": "This idea harnesses the external gap identified: the underutilization of commonsense knowledge graphs and their integration into explainability models. By bridging semantic ontologies with structured knowledge bases, we can enhance depth and context-sensitivity of explanations, a novel direction with transformative potential.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a novel interpretability pipeline where explanation outputs are enriched by mapping language model internal states to concepts and relations in large commonsense knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, ATOMIC). Use knowledge graph completion and embedding alignment techniques to link latent model dimensions to knowledge graph nodes and edges, enabling explanations that reason about plausibility and common sense grounded in graph semantics for polysemous or ambiguous inputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select benchmark language understanding datasets with known ambiguities. 2) Run large transformer models and extract hidden states. 3) Align model latent features to knowledge graph embeddings via joint training. 4) Develop explanation modules that traverse linked knowledge graphs to justify model decisions. 5) Evaluate interpretability improvements quantitatively (e.g., user trust, disambiguation accuracy) and qualitatively (user studies). 6) Compare to baseline XAI methods without commonsense embedding.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence ‘He went to the bank.’ Expected output: Explanation that, using context, links 'bank' to relevant graph node (financial institution vs riverbank) and shows model reasoning path correlating with commonsense knowledge, clarifying ambiguous interpretation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If graph alignment is noisy, resort to rule-based heuristics for weak supervision of concept linking. Alternatively, pre-train embeddings separately and test modular fusion with model outputs before joint training."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section outlines a high-level approach to link language model internal states to commonsense knowledge graphs via embedding alignment and knowledge graph completion. However, the core mechanism lacks clarity and detail, particularly regarding how latent dimensions in transformer models specifically map to discrete concepts and relations in large, heterogeneous knowledge graphs like ConceptNet or ATOMIC. It is unclear how the model will handle the polysemy of latent features or address potential mismatches in granularity and representation between continuous model states and symbolic graph nodes. To strengthen soundness, please clarify the precise techniques for embedding alignment, the objective functions used, and how the system will disambiguate overlapping or nested graph concepts to produce faithful explanations that are cognitively plausible and computationally tractable. Including preliminary results or a rationale for the feasibility of meaningful latent-graph mappings would also improve confidence in the approach's validity. This foundational mechanism underpins the entire pipeline; without a well-articulated and justified process, the overall method risks being too vague and may fail to realize its interpretability goals effectively. The section \"Proposed_Method\" must be expanded with concrete architectural details, training objectives, and handling of semantic mismatches to enhance clarity and rigor in how explanations are constructed from integrated knowledge graph semantics and latent model states. \n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is generally well-structured but omits critical practical considerations that could impact successful implementation. For instance, the plan entails aligning latent features of large transformer models to knowledge graph embeddings via joint training, a process known to be computationally intensive and potentially unstable given the difference in data modalities and representation granularity. There is no discussion of dataset scale, strategies for mitigating noise in alignment, or contingency plans if the joint embedding approach fails beyond fallback heuristics. Additionally, the evaluation metrics such as 'user trust' and 'disambiguation accuracy' are underspecified; more rigorous, reproducible quantification methods should be described, especially how user studies will be designed to isolate the effect of commonsense-enriched explanations. To ensure feasibility, the experiment plan should outline resource requirements, detailed methodology for embedding alignment (e.g., objectives, loss functions), and a timeline reflecting incremental milestones to verify intermediate successes (e.g., quality of alignment before explanation). Clarifying these points will facilitate practical execution, help anticipate challenges in scaling or optimization, and yield more reliable assessment of interpretability improvements. Thus, the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan should be expanded with these concrete adoptable best practices to bolster project feasibility and credibility. \n\nTarget section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
