        "title": "Multimodal Graph Neural Contrastive Framework Integrating Semantic Hierarchies and Commonsense for Transparent Language and Vision-Language Model Mechanistic Interpretability",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing models largely fall short of jointly harnessing semantic hierarchies and commonsense knowledge graphs to reveal internal mechanisms of large language models, especially when extended to multimodal settings involving intertwined textual and visual information. Furthermore, current approaches lack rigorous, reproducible alignment mechanisms and quantitative interpretability evaluation, limiting generalization to unseen domains and reasoning capabilities across modalities.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work connects graph structures to language model interpretability, the novelty and competitive advantage of this proposal lie in its unified, multimodal framework that integrates semantic hierarchies and commonsense knowledge graphs with both textual and visual representations from language and vision-language models, using a principled, cross-space contrastive learning mechanism. By explicitly designing a transparent and quantitatively evaluable alignment method, the approach advances mechanistic interpretability beyond conceptual overlaps toward operationalized, generalized explanations. This positions the research at the forefront of next-generation AI that demands robust, out-of-distribution generalization and multimodal reasoning.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We introduce a novel architecture comprising: 1) A dual-branch Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder employing relational graph convolution layers that jointly encode combined semantic hierarchy and commonsense knowledge graphs into structured embeddings preserving relational dependencies; 2) A multimodal encoder extracting internal states of language models (LMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) at various layers to obtain textual and visual embeddings; 3) A carefully formulated, cross-space contrastive loss function leveraging a symmetric InfoNCE objective with adaptive margin thresholds and modality-specific projection heads to align graph embeddings with multimodal model internal states; 4) Mechanistic interpretability is quantitatively evaluated via novel graph-relevant probing tasks extended to vision-language benchmarks, embedding alignment metrics such as topological similarity and mutual information, and ablation studies measuring node and relation importance contributions through gradient-based attribution methods. This rigorous framework ensures transparent, reproducible operationalization of alignment between heterogeneous graphs and internal representations. Additionally, to bolster out-of-distribution generalization, training includes domain- and modality-shifted datasets, testing alignment robustness to novel concepts and visual scenes. Together, these components surpass existing methods by enabling scalable, multimodal mechanistic interpretability anchored in structured knowledge and state-of-the-art representation learning.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct enriched semantic-commonsense knowledge graphs encompassing hierarchical ontologies and commonsense relations relevant to textual and visual domains. 2) Develop and train the dual-branch GNN encoder to jointly embed these graphs preserving relational semantics using relational graph convolutions, validating embedding quality via graph reconstruction and node classification metrics. 3) Extract internal embeddings across multiple layers from pretrained language and vision-language models on standardized datasets (e.g., Wikipedia text, MSCOCO images with captions). 4) Implement and optimize the proposed cross-space contrastive loss aligning GNN and multimodal embeddings using InfoNCE with adaptive margins; perform hyperparameter tuning for projection dimensions and training schedules. 5) Design and deploy graph-relevant probing and interpretability tasks assessing mechanistic alignment quantitatively, including topological similarity, mutual information, and gradient-based attribution for node/relation influence on alignments. 6) Evaluate out-of-distribution generalization on unseen textual concepts and novel visual domains to test robustness. 7) Conduct ablation studies comparing performance with single-modality baselines, alternative graph encoders, and contrastive objectives to isolate impact of design choices. 8) Analyze empirical results to elucidate mechanistic interpretability advances and generate insights for future next-generation AI reasoning frameworks.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: Input - Text: \"apple\", Visual: image of apple fruit, Graph: combined semantic and commonsense subgraph around concept 'apple' (including category 'fruit', usage, related concepts like 'orchard' and 'pie'). Expected Output - High similarity alignment between GNN embeddings of graph and internal LM/VLM states for 'apple', demonstrating joint textual-visual mechanistic representation explicable via graph relations. Example 2: Input - Text about 'medical diagnosis' with associated pathology image, Graph: medical semantic hierarchies and commonsense relations on diagnosis. Expected Output - Aligned embeddings reflecting mechanistic correspondence between model states and domain knowledge, with gradients highlighting crucial graph nodes contributing to interpretability. Example 3: Evaluate out-of-distribution sample describing novel fruit or visual domain (e.g., 'dragonfruit' from agricultural domain shift), expecting reasonable embedding alignment with graph via generalization of learned mechanistic alignment.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If scalability of joint semantic-commonsense GNN encoders becomes prohibitive due to graph size or multimodal complexity, we will prune knowledge graphs to focused subgraphs based on downstream task relevance and node centrality metrics. Alternatively, we will replace relational graph convolutions with efficient attention-based graph transformers that better scale with heterogeneous graphs and modalities. We also plan to distill or project embeddings into lower-dimensional spaces with minimal loss to further ease training. If alignment training convergence is challenging, curriculum training starting from unimodal contrastive objectives progressing to multimodal alignment will be used. Finally, if mechanistic interpretability evaluation lacks sensitivity, additional probing datasets and novel attribution techniques will be integrated to robustly quantify model explanations."

Further details on the mechanism by which graph relational structure is encoded and leveraged to achieve mechanistic interpretability are needed to establish soundness. Consider elaborating on the architectural design, loss functions, and how interpretability is quantitatively evaluated within the framework to improve transparency and reproducibility of the approach, addressing the gap between conceptualization and operationalization in the method section of the proposal (Proposed_Method). This will strengthen confidence in the method's validity and plausibility of the stated goals, especially given the complexity of integrating heterogeneous graphs with language model internals via contrastive learning frameworks, which is nontrivial and not yet standard practice in the field today (Proposed_Method)."

For example, extending the framework to incorporate multimodal reasoning by aligning semantic-commonsense graphs with both textual and visual embeddings can broaden impact and novelty. Alternatively, leveraging recent advances in 'out-of-distribution generalization' to test how well the learned mechanistic alignment generalizes to unseen concepts or domains would position the work in a forward-thinking context aligned with 'next generation of AI' trends. This suggestion provides a concrete path to increase both the scope and novelty of the idea (Title, Problem_Statement, Proposed_Method)."
