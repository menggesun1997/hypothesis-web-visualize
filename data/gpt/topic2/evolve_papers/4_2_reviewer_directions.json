    "title": "Reinforcement Learning Framework with Embedded Private Data Governance",
    "Problem_Statement": "Integrating private, sensitive data into language model-driven decision systems faces challenges in maintaining privacy compliance and capturing domain expertise during reinforcement learning optimization.",
    "Motivation": "This addresses the critical gap of bias and data-sensitivity limitations tied to private training data, responding to the innovation opportunity of combining data governance with RL paradigms to drastically improve output quality and compliance.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel reinforcement learning architecture that embeds privacy-preserving mechanisms like differential privacy and secure multi-party computation directly into the RL reward and policy updates. The framework will also feature domain expertise representation modules that guide policy decisions via expert knowledge graphs, ensuring domain-aligned and compliant concept generation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select finance and organizational decision-making datasets with private data annotations.\n2) Implement RL agents with privacy mechanisms.\n3) Construct domain expertise graphs from expert-validated sources.\n4) Integrate these graphs into RL policy learning.\n5) Evaluate output accuracy, privacy leakage risks, and compliance against baseline RL models.\n6) Conduct ablation studies on governance modules.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "'Input: Optimize investment portfolio recommendations using private client data.\nExpected Output: Model generates compliant, accurate, and domain-expert-aligned suggestions with mathematically bounded privacy guarantees.'",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If privacy mechanisms degrade performance excessively, fallback to federated RL setups with local learning on client devices or incorporate human-in-the-loop verification for sensitive decisions."
