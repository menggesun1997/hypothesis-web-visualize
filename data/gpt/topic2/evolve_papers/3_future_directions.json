        "title": "Hierarchical Ontology-Driven Contrastive Learning for Mechanistic Language Model Interpretability",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing contrastive learning methods in language models emphasize image-based datasets and lack direct integration of hierarchical semantic knowledge crucial for mechanistic interpretability, thereby limiting insights into internal model representations aligned with human cognition.",
        "Motivation": "This project addresses the internal and external critical gaps by explicitly incorporating WordNet semantic hierarchies into contrastive learning frameworks tailored for deep language models, responding to the identified need for domain-specific interpretability approaches beyond visual analogies.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hierarchical contrastive learning framework integrating language model embeddings with WordNet ontology layers. The method entails constructing positive and negative sample pairs informed by semantic distances within the ontology, enabling the language model to encode mechanistic representations coherent with hierarchical meanings. This approach includes encoding semantic path lengths and hypernym-hyponym relationships as contrastive signals, fused with text embeddings to guide model interpretability analysis.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset: Use large text corpora enriched with WordNet semantic annotations; 2) Model: Fine-tune a transformer-based language model with the proposed hierarchical contrastive loss; 3) Baselines: Compare with existing contrastive methods lacking ontology integration; 4) Evaluation: Measure interpretability via probing tasks aligned with semantic hierarchy (e.g., hypernym detection), and contrastive loss improvements; 5) Analysis: Visualize internal embeddings to detect mechanistic alignment with ontology; 6) Reproducibility: Apply statistical tests to ensure robust results.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence pairs like \"A dog is running\" and \"An animal is running\"; Expected Output: Model's embeddings show reduced distance reflecting hypernym relation (dog → animal), illustrating ontology-aligned mechanistic insight rather than surface similarity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If hierarchical loss fails to improve alignment, fallback to applying soft ontological regularization using graph neural networks to model semantic relations or hybrid unsupervised clustering of embeddings for semantically informed contrastive grouping."

        "Problem_Statement": "Current interpretability frameworks for language models inadequately integrate multimodal data and commonsense knowledge, missing potential mechanistic insights that arise from joint text-image-concept embeddings inspired by cognitive robotics representations.",

        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a multimodal embedding space combining text from language models, relevant images from annotated corpora, and commonsense concepts from knowledge graphs like ConceptNet. Inspired by cognitive robotics representations, build a contrastive learning objective that enforces cross-modal and commonsense grounding—positive pairs correspond to correct text-image-concept alignments, negatives are mismatched or semantically distant triples. This encourages language models to develop mechanistic representations that incorporate embodied, situational, and commonsense knowledge.",

        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a contrastive loss function that weights positive and negative pairs by semantic path distance between concepts in WordNet, creating a smooth supervision signal reflecting ontology structure. Integrate this loss into the embedding space of language models to expose mechanistic structures capturing nuanced semantic proximity.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Prepare text corpora with WordNet tags; 2) Compute semantic path distances for pair sampling; 3) Train language model embeddings with weighted contrastive loss; 4) Compare interpretability against unweighted methods; 5) Evaluate on downstream tasks requiring semantic nuance (e.g., paraphrase detection).",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentences \"The wolf howled\" and \"The dog barked\" with semantic distance small but non-zero; Expected Output: Embeddings show proportional similarity reflecting approximate relation, showcasing mechanistic insight at finer granularity.",
