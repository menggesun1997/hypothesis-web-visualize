          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an IoT-inspired distributed testing architecture utilizing multiple lightweight nodes performing real-time behavioral tests on language models. However, the description lacks clarity on critical operational details: how are these distributed nodes coordinated? What are the precise communication protocols and fault tolerance mechanisms? How will the method handle latency or synchronization among nodes? Without a clear mechanism for adapting existing IoT fault detection principles to the inherently different domain of language model behavior, the approach risks oversimplification. The proposal should strengthen the mechanism's explanation by detailing how architectural elements from IoT testing concretely translate to the software and model testing context, including event-trigger criteria, adaptive scheduling algorithms, and failure handling strategies to ensure robustness and accuracy in real-time evaluation. Providing a more rigorous conceptual and architectural design will greatly improve the idea's soundness and credibility in this competitive area, where strong baselines and mature testing frameworks exist already. This refinement is essential before proceeding to prototyping and experiments in Step 2 or beyond. Targeting these mechanistic gaps in the Proposed_Method section is crucial for the work’s theoretical grounding and practical viability."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is logically sequenced but raises concerns about practicality and scientific rigor. Deploying a network of simulated test nodes across multiple LM API endpoints (Step 2) and simulating evolving input distributions (Step 3) are ambitious yet lack specificity on evaluation criteria, datasets, scale, and metrics. For example, the plan does not specify how the evolving input distributions will be realistically modeled or controlled, nor which metrics will concretely quantify 'quality degradations.' Further, the plan omits considerations about resource consumption, latency overhead, and the system's scalability under real-world conditions. The fallback plan's periodic batch evaluations with incremental learning is promising but remains vague in implementation. To ensure feasibility, the experiment plan should clearly define datasets, evaluation metrics tailored to the key quality dimensions (consistency, bias drift, semantic coherence), baseline comparisons with established LM evaluation frameworks, and concrete performance targets. This refinement will enable a credible demonstration of the system’s value and help address reproducibility and benchmarking demands common in the community. Without these clarifications and tighter experiment design, feasibility questions remain significant and threaten the work’s impact and acceptance."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the listed globally-linked concepts, the proposal could substantially enhance impact and distinctiveness by integrating aspects of 'interpretability of ML' and 'trust architecture.' Specifically, embedding interpretable monitoring modules or explainable anomaly detection within the distributed testing nodes could provide transparent diagnostics when inconsistencies or semantic drifts are detected. Additionally, leveraging principles from 'Zero Trust Architecture' could strengthen the security and reliability of the distributed test framework, especially critical for safety-sensitive domains like healthcare and finance addressed here. Incorporating these advanced concepts will differentiate the proposal from existing LM evaluation tools by providing not only real-time fault detection but also trustworthy, auditable insights supporting domain-specific compliance requirements and user trust. This direction exploits strong interdisciplinary synergies and current research frontiers, elevating the idea from an incremental improvement to potential paradigm shift in LM robustness monitoring."
