        "title": "Semantic Priming-Informed Contrastive Explanation Framework with Formalized Mechanism and Cognitive Evaluation for Ambiguous Language Understanding",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current interpretability approaches for language models lack a rigorous integration of semantic priming phenomena and cognitive processing patterns to explain why certain ambiguous interpretations are favored, resulting in explanations that do not sufficiently reflect nuanced human comprehension mechanisms or provide contrastive insights grounded in cognitive data.",
        "Motivation": "While semantic priming has been explored in cognitive linguistics and some NLP contexts, there remains a crucial gap in systematically incorporating quantitative cognitive behavioral measures, such as self-paced reading tasks and semantic cue conflict patterns, into contrastive explanation frameworks for language models. Our method innovates beyond static explanation paradigms by embedding semantic and syntactic cue-weighted evidence reflecting human processing patterns and cognitive priming strengths, thereby bridging interpretability with robust cognitive modeling. This positions our work as uniquely advancing interpretability tools to align with human-like semantic and syntactic processing, addressing NOV-COMPETITIVE concerns by integrating formalized mechanisms with rich behavioral data and experimental validation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a formal contrastive explanation framework that combines (i) extraction of competing interpretations via model-internal representations and (ii) quantitative integration of semantic priming and syntactic cue strengths measured from cognitive behavioral datasets (e.g., self-paced reading times, cue conflict experiments). Specifically, the method entails: 1) Representation Extraction: Identify alternative parses or semantic frames within the language model by probing activations and attention distributions, representing competing interpretations explicitly as vectors or subspaces. 2) Feature Attribution: Compute feature importance scores for each interpretation using integrated gradients or similar attribution methods localized to linguistic regions (e.g., verb region, semantic cues). 3) Priming Quantification: Derive priming strength weights by aligning linguistic components with behavioral measures of semantic priming and syntactic cue saliency from datasets involving both typical and special populations (including insights from reading patterns of deaf readers and individuals with language disorders to enrich robustness). 4) Integration Mechanism: Formally weight feature importance scores with priming strengths via a mathematically defined function (e.g., weighted sum or attention gating: ExplanationScore_i = \u00039 i (FeatureImportance_i * PrimingWeight_i), normalized across interpretations). This is operationalized in a modular pipeline illustrated via schematic diagrams depicting flow from ambiguous input \u00021 language model activation extraction \u00021 competing interpretation vectorization \u00021 priming weighting \u00021 contrastive explanation generation. This framework aligns model explanations closely with cognitive processes and linguistic structure, enhancing interpretability credibility and reproducibility.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Curation: Combine multiple semantic priming datasets containing ambiguous linguistic stimuli with rich behavioral measures (self-paced reading times, cue conflict scores, verb region effects) and supplement with publicly available corpora with syntactic ambiguity annotations. 2) Model Setup: Use state-of-the-art language models with probing tools to extract competing interpretations and generate baseline explanations. 3) Priming Quantification: Operationalize priming weights by statistically modeling behavioral data (e.g., normalized priming strength per word/region) and mapping these to linguistic features. 4) Integration & Implementation: Develop and implement the formal weighting mechanism within the explanation pipeline. 5) Interpretability Evaluation: Conduct carefully designed user studies with clearly defined hypotheses, recruiting diverse participants (including linguistic novices and experts), to measure alignment between priming-weighted explanations and human interpretability ratings using quantitative metrics (e.g., qualitative feedback, task-based comprehension accuracy). 6) Robustness Checks: Investigate model interpretability across special populations (e.g., deaf readers, individuals with severe language disorder) to validate generalization and cognitive relevance. 7) Comparative Analysis: Benchmark against non-priming weighted baselines to demonstrate improvement in explanation quality and cognitive plausibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Ambiguous phrase 'The old man the boats.' Expected output: Contrastive paired explanations that decompose the sentence into competing syntactic-semantic parses (e.g., interpreting 'man' as verb versus noun). Feature attributions in the verb region and semantic cue regions are weighted by priming strengths derived from self-paced reading task measurements revealing processing facilitation patterns. The explanation clearly highlights how semantic priming and syntactic cues bias interpretation preference, reflecting cognitive processing flow and cue conflict resolution, thereby elucidating model choice with enhanced human alignment.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If cognitive behavioral priming data is sparse or incomplete, simulate priming-like effects by combining distributional semantic similarity measures with syntactic cue saliency scores derived from linguistic structural analyses. Use these proxies to approximate cognitive weighting, while transparently noting limitations and validating against smaller-scale behavioral datasets. Additionally, apply iterative refinement incorporating synthetic priming simulations calibrated using smaller human experiments or crowd-sourced studies to approximate priming effects for under-resourced linguistic contexts."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section outlines a promising approach by integrating semantic priming behavioral data into contrastive explanations. However, the exact mechanism by which semantic priming strengths are quantitatively incorporated into the explanation generation remains under-specified. It is unclear how the priming weights interact with model-internal features or which model components are involved in this weighting process. Clarifying this integration step with a concrete algorithmic or mathematical formulation would strengthen the soundness and reproducibility of the method. Additionally, specifying how competing interpretations are extracted and represented internally before weighting would improve clarity and rigor in the methodology description. Without this, the method risks being conceptually appealing but practically vague and difficult to implement or validate rigorously. Consider including a formal framework or schematic illustrating the flow from ambiguous input through model prediction variants, feature extraction, priming weighting, and final explanation output to solidify the mechanism's clarity and feasibility in future drafts or experiments."

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan is coherent but faces feasibility challenges around data sufficiency and evaluation robustness. Curating semantic priming datasets with ambiguous stimuli (Step 1) might be limited by the availability of sufficiently rich and relevant behavioral data, which the fallback plan acknowledges. The fallback substitution using distributional semantic or co-occurrence proxies is reasonable but risks deviating from genuine cognitive priming phenomena, which could undermine the central motivation. Furthermore, Step 5 proposes user studies for interpretability alignment but lacks detail on experimental design, population, or metrics, which are important for demonstrating impact credibly. To enhance feasibility, the proposal should specify data sources or justify coverage, detail the plan to operationalize cognitive priming effects quantitatively, and outline the user study design with clear hypotheses, subject recruitment criteria, and interpretability measurement protocols."
