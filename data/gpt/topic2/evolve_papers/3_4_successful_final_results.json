        "title": "Cross-Modal Neural Representational Geometry Contrastive Learning for Robust Mechanistic Discovery in Language Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current mechanistic interpretability approaches often neglect the underlying geometric relationships of neural representations across different modalities, particularly between language and vision models. This gap limits our understanding of whether aligned geometric structures capture true mechanistic components or merely correlate superficial embedding features, hindering cross-modal mechanistic insights relevant to deep neural network interpretability.",
        "Motivation": "While representational geometry and contrastive learning have been explored individually, their integration to probe shared mechanistic components across language and vision modalities remains underexploited. By grounding this approach in established interpretability theory and empirical evidence, we aim to rigorously test and validate whether cross-modal geometric alignment reveals interpretable, mechanistic subspaces. This addresses the novel opportunity to evaluate deep neural networks' internal mechanisms through human-like cross-modal tasks, potentially enabling richer, generalizable mechanistic insights beyond correlational co-embeddings and setting a new standard for multimodal mechanistic interpretability.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a theoretically grounded framework combining contrastive learning with representational similarity analysis (RSA) and advanced manifold alignment to align intrinsic geometry of language model and visual encoder activations. Crucially, we integrate diagnostic probes and specialized ablation studies targeting known, interpretable mechanistic components (e.g., syntax trees, attention heads, neuron clusters with semantic roles) in language models and vision encoders to verify correspondence between geometric alignment and mechanistic meaning. Pilot studies on human-like multimodal classification tasks will evaluate whether geometry-preserving embeddings improve interpretability and performance. Furthermore, to address embedding noise and complexity, dimensionality reduction via nonlinear methods (e.g., UMAP, Isomap) will be incorporated before alignment. This method innovatively leverages cross-modal representational geometry contrast to evaluate and discover deep neural networks’ underlying mechanisms with rigor, surpassing prior correlational embedding alignment techniques.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect paired text-image datasets (e.g., MS COCO captions) with access to activations from pretrained language and visual models.\n2) Apply nonlinear dimensionality reduction to reduce noise and preserve local global geometry.\n3) Compute intrinsic geometry metrics (dimensionality, curvature) with clearly defined, validated operational procedures.\n4) Develop contrastive learning framework with explicit geometry-preserving losses, including hyperparameter tuning and robust initialization strategies;\n5) Conduct diagnostic probes to test whether aligned geometric components correspond to known mechanistic entities, with systematic ablation to isolate geometry’s role.\n6) Pilot experiments on smaller-scale models and datasets to calibrate and optimize computational load and stability.\n7) Evaluate interpretability quantitatively via geometric disentanglement indices linked to benchmark mechanistic features and qualitatively via cross-modal retrieval accuracy and human-like task performance.\n8) Define explicit success criteria and contingency triggers to switch to fallback plans involving relaxed geometric constraints or alternative regularized disentanglement methods ensuring feasibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Paired textual descriptions with corresponding images and recorded model activation patterns from both language and vision models.\nExpected Output: The model uncovers shared geometric subspaces that align with independently verified mechanistic components (e.g., syntactic structures, semantic clusters, visual object detectors), demonstrating improvement in cross-modal retrieval and revealing interpretable, causally relevant neural mechanisms underlying human-like multimodal understanding tasks.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If strict geometry-preserving contrastive learning proves too restrictive or unstable, we will progressively relax alignment constraints or replace them with regularized disentanglement losses that encourage independent mechanistic components without complete geometry preservation. Additionally, scaling down experiments to subsets and enforcing additional dimensionality reduction or noise filtering will be employed. Alternative evaluation metrics emphasizing mechanistic interpretability rather than pure geometric alignment will guide iterative refinement to maximize robustness and practicality."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that aligning neural representational geometries across language and vision modalities via contrastive learning will lead to mechanistic interpretability may be overly optimistic without stronger theoretical or empirical justification. Neural representational geometry-driven alignment is a novel approach, but it assumes shared geometric components truly reflect mechanistic aspects rather than correlational features or superficial embeddings. Clarify and strengthen the rationale behind why geometric alignment captures mechanistic insights beyond existing interpretability approaches, possibly citing relevant prior work or pilot studies to validate this assumption before committing to the method design fully. This will bolster the foundational soundness of the proposed method and avoid risks of chasing spurious geometric patterns that lack mechanistic meaning, especially given the complexity of multimodal embeddings and their manifold structures in deep networks.  Suggest incorporating diagnostic probes or ablation studies planned to verify that geometric alignment components correspond to known interpretable mechanisms within language models or vision encoders as a safeguard step in the methodology design. This will build confidence that the main assumption is valid and the research is soundly grounded in interpretability theory conventions and current empirical evidence trends within mechanistic interpretability literature.\n\nTarget: Proposed_Method"

These challenges may threaten feasibility given multimodal model activations often come with high dimensionality and noise.\n\nSpecifically, the step \"Train contrastive model constrained to preserve geometry alignment\" might be computationally demanding and sensitive to hyperparameters or initializations; it is unclear how stability and convergence will be ensured. Moreover, evaluation metrics such as \"geometric disentanglement indices\" need clearer operational definitions and validation benchmarks. \n\nRecommend expanding the experiment plan to include phased pilot studies with smaller-scale models or subsets of data to empirically calibrate geometry metrics and contrastive loss formulations. Also, specify fallback computational strategies, e.g., dimensionality reduction techniques, to reduce noise and enhance geometry measurement reliability. Adding more explicit criteria to decide when to switch to fallback plans would improve experimental robustness and overall feasibility.\n\nTarget: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
