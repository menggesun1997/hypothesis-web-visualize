    "title": "Semantic Priming-Informed Contrastive Explanation for Ambiguous Language Understanding",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current explanations of language model predictions do not leverage semantic priming phenomena to contrastively elucidate why certain interpretations are favored over others, limiting interpretability depth.",
    "Motivation": "By embedding semantic priming effects into explanations, this idea innovates beyond static explanation to dynamic, contrastive reasoning grounded in cognitive behavioral data, bridging internal gaps of nuanced cognitive modeling in interpretability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a contrastive explanation framework that generates paired explanations juxtaposing competing interpretations of ambiguous inputs. Use semantic priming behavioral statistics to weight components of the explanation, highlighting which aspects are cognitively facilitated in human comprehension, aligning model reasoning with priming-enhanced semantic associations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate semantic priming datasets with ambiguous stimuli. 2) Obtain language model prediction variants over these stimuli. 3) Generate contrastive explanations identifying model internal features distinguishing interpretations. 4) Weight explanations by priming strength captured in behavioral data. 5) Evaluate alignment with human interpretability judgements through user studies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Ambiguous phrase ‘The old man the boats.’ Expected output: Paired explanations contrasting ‘man’ as verb vs noun interpretation, with weights reflecting semantic priming, clarifying model’s chosen interpretation wrap.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If behavioral data is sparse, simulate priming-like effects using distributional semantic metrics or lexical co-occurrence statistics as proxies."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section outlines a promising approach by integrating semantic priming behavioral data into contrastive explanations. However, the exact mechanism by which semantic priming strengths are quantitatively incorporated into the explanation generation remains under-specified. It is unclear how the priming weights interact with model-internal features or which model components are involved in this weighting process. Clarifying this integration step with a concrete algorithmic or mathematical formulation would strengthen the soundness and reproducibility of the method. Additionally, specifying how competing interpretations are extracted and represented internally before weighting would improve clarity and rigor in the methodology description. Without this, the method risks being conceptually appealing but practically vague and difficult to implement or validate rigorously. Consider including a formal framework or schematic illustrating the flow from ambiguous input through model prediction variants, feature extraction, priming weighting, and final explanation output to solidify the mechanism's clarity and feasibility in future drafts or experiments."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan is coherent but faces feasibility challenges around data sufficiency and evaluation robustness. Curating semantic priming datasets with ambiguous stimuli (Step 1) might be limited by the availability of sufficiently rich and relevant behavioral data, which the fallback plan acknowledges. The fallback substitution using distributional semantic or co-occurrence proxies is reasonable but risks deviating from genuine cognitive priming phenomena, which could undermine the central motivation. Furthermore, Step 5 proposes user studies for interpretability alignment but lacks detail on experimental design, population, or metrics, which are important for demonstrating impact credibly. To enhance feasibility, the proposal should specify data sources or justify coverage, detail the plan to operationalize cognitive priming effects quantitatively, and outline the user study design with clear hypotheses, subject recruitment criteria, and interpretability measurement protocols."
