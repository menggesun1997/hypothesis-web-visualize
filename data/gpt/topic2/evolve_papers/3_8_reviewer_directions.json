    "title": "Graph Neural Contrastive Framework to Integrate Semantic Hierarchy and Commonsense for Language Model Transparency",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current models do not jointly exploit graph structures from semantic hierarchies and commonsense knowledge to reveal language model internal mechanisms.",
    "Motivation": "This idea bridges the external gap of missing links between semantic ontologies and commonsense knowledge by applying graph neural networks (GNNs) within contrastive learning to jointly encode these ontologies and improve mechanistic interpretability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Use GNN encoders to process combined semantic hierarchy and commonsense knowledge graphs producing embeddings capturing relational structure. Contrast language model internal states against these graph embeddings with a novel cross-space contrastive loss, enforcing transparent mechanistic alignment with human-understood graphs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build combined semantic-commonsense graphs; 2) Train GNN encoder to generate joint graph embeddings; 3) Contrast with language model layer outputs; 4) Benchmark interpretability using graph-relevant probing tasks; 5) Analyze embedding alignment and node importance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Text embedding for concept \"apple\" and graph embedding for its semantic and commonsense neighborhood; Expected Output: Close embedding alignment indicating shared mechanistic representation explicable via graph relations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If GNN scaling is a bottleneck, prune or cluster graphs to smaller subgraphs or apply attention-based graph transformers for efficient processing."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks clarity on how the cross-space contrastive loss is formulated and optimized to effectively align language model internal states with combined semantic and commonsense graph embeddings. Further details on the mechanism by which graph relational structure is encoded and leveraged to achieve mechanistic interpretability are needed to establish soundness. Consider elaborating on the architectural design, loss functions, and how interpretability is quantitatively evaluated within the framework to improve transparency and reproducibility of the approach, addressing the gap between conceptualization and operationalization in the method section of the proposal (Proposed_Method). This will strengthen confidence in the method's validity and plausibility of the stated goals, especially given the complexity of integrating heterogeneous graphs with language model internals via contrastive learning frameworks, which is nontrivial and not yet standard practice in the field today (Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and the highly competitive existing work connecting graph-based representations and language model interpretability, the proposal would benefit greatly from explicitly integrating perspectives from globally-linked concepts such as 'representation learning,' 'reasoning method,' and 'vision-language models.' For example, extending the framework to incorporate multimodal reasoning by aligning semantic-commonsense graphs with both textual and visual embeddings can broaden impact and novelty. Alternatively, leveraging recent advances in 'out-of-distribution generalization' to test how well the learned mechanistic alignment generalizes to unseen concepts or domains would position the work in a forward-thinking context aligned with 'next generation of AI' trends. This suggestion provides a concrete path to increase both the scope and novelty of the idea (Title, Problem_Statement, Proposed_Method)."
