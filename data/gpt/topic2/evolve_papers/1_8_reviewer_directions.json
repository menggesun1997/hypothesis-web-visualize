    "title": "Hierarchical Semantic Graph Transformer for Scientific Document Understanding",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing transformers lack effective modeling of hierarchical semantic relations and long-range dependencies in scientific documents, limiting deep theory advancement and benchmarking capabilities.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gap on long-range dependency modeling and semantic understanding by integrating graph neural networks and hierarchical transformers inspired by feature pyramids.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a hybrid transformer-graph architecture where a hierarchical transformer extracts multi-scale textual features, which are then structured into semantic graphs representing scientific concepts and relations. A graph transformer module processes this hierarchy, enabling reasoning over long-range dependencies. Masked attention is applied both on text and graph nodes for efficient contextual integration.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Use scientific papers annotated with semantic graphs or extract via distant supervision. (2) Train hierarchical transformer and graph modules jointly with masked reconstruction and relation prediction objectives. (3) Evaluate on document-level QA and summarization tasks requiring deep understanding. (4) Compare with standard transformers and GNN baselines on accuracy and interpretability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Scientific article sections and annotations of concept relations. Expected output: Model reconstructs text with masked key terms and infers correct semantic relations, answering complex queries about the document's scientific findings.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If graph construction is noisy, incorporate self-supervised graph learning or constrain graph to high-confidence edges. Alternatively, explore simpler hierarchical attention without graphs."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a promising hybrid transformer-graph architecture but lacks sufficient detail on how semantic graphs are constructed, maintained, and integrated with hierarchical textual features. Clarify the methodology for constructing semantic graphs from multi-scale features, the nature of nodes and edges, and how masked attention coordinates between text and graph nodes to enable effective reasoning. Providing algorithmic or architectural diagrams will greatly help in understanding and evaluating the mechanistic soundness of the approach. Additionally, discuss potential limitations of this integration to demonstrate awareness of challenges and design choices made to address them (e.g., graph sparsity, noise, or computational complexity). This clarity is essential for assessing the validity and robustness of the core mechanism proposed in this work, particularly given the novelty competition in this field. Targeting improved mechanistic exposition will also facilitate replication and benchmarking by future researchers, thereby increasing scientific rigor and impact potential through transparency and verifiability, which are critical in hierarchical document understanding models of this complexity and scale (e.g., inspired by hierarchical graph convolutional networks and dynamic graph attention networks). Furthermore, explicitly detailing how the masked reconstruction and relation prediction objectives are combined and optimized within the joint training regime will strengthen confidence in the soundness of the method's learning framework and its alignment with the problem statement on long-range dependency and semantic relation modeling in scientific documents. Consider referencing or adapting state-of-the-art methods in hierarchical transformers and robust graph neural networks with attention mechanisms for concrete implementation inspiration and benchmarking baselines to solidify the mechanism's expected efficacy and innovation positioning within the already competitive landscape of transformer-graph hybrids for document understanding applications (e.g., biomedical relation extraction or deep contextualized embeddings). This will make the Proposed_Method section substantially stronger and more convincing, confirming that the approach is practical, scientifically grounded, and well-conceived to succeed in complex scientific document tasks such as deep QA and summarization, as proposed in Experiment_Plan and Test_Case_Examples sections. It will reduce ambiguity on how the interaction between textual and structural representations brings added value beyond prior work combining hierarchical feature extraction with graph convolutional networks in textual domains. Overall, a more detailed and rigorously justified mechanism description is critical to guarantee sound foundational assumptions and clear path to feasibility, as currently implied but not explicitly demonstrated in the submitted idea's text and diagrammatic elements (if any). This must be addressed prior to further large-scale experiments and comparisons to standard transformers and GNN baselines, ensuring that the joint training with masked objectives is theoretically justified and practically implementable with current datasets and computational resources. In summary: clarity, specificity, and justification of the hybrid model architecture and learning objectives are urgently needed to verify soundness and advance this highly competitive idea to maturity and eventual impactful results in scientific document understanding."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the idea's novelty rating as NOV-COMPETITIVE and its ambitious goal to improve hierarchical semantic understanding in scientific documents via hybrid transformer-graph networks, I suggest leveraging recent advances in 'pre-trained language models' and 'hierarchical graph convolutional networks' from the Globally-Linked Concepts to enhance both impact and novelty. For example, incorporating large-scale pre-trained transformer models fine-tuned with hierarchical graph-aware modules for semantic relation extraction can improve performance and efficiently leverage transfer learning from vast general corpora to domain-specific scientific documents. Additionally, integrating 'dynamic graph attention networks' or 'heterogeneous graph neural network' architectures could provide adaptive edge weighting and multi-relational reasoning capacity, addressing potential noise and ambiguity in distant supervision graph construction steps as mentioned in the fallback plan. Furthermore, suggesting experiments with biomedical relation extraction datasets or leveraging structured knowledge bases as distant supervision sources aligns with the focus on scientific documents and introduces stronger external grounding. This integration may position the work uniquely at the intersection of hierarchical transformer architectures, graph-based semantic reasoning, and state-of-the-art pre-trained language models, thereby expanding its applicability beyond document-level QA and summarization towards more general scientific knowledge graph construction and reasoning tasks with broader impact. Explicitly building connections to these linked concepts and state-of-the-art components will also strengthen the paper's positioning against competing works, improve reviewers' appreciation of its technical depth, and unlock new avenues for high-impact contributions in deep semantic understanding for scientific NLP."
