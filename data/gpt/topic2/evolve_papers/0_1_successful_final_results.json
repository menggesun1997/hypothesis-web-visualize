    "title": "Commonsense Knowledge Graph Integration for Disambiguation in Language Model Interpretability",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing language model interpretability techniques lack incorporation of structured commonsense knowledge, limiting their ability to explain ambiguous or context-dependent language understanding in a cognitively plausible manner.",
    "Motivation": "This idea harnesses the external gap identified: the underutilization of commonsense knowledge graphs and their integration into explainability models. By bridging semantic ontologies with structured knowledge bases, we can enhance depth and context-sensitivity of explanations, a novel direction with transformative potential.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a novel interpretability pipeline where explanation outputs are enriched by mapping language model internal states to concepts and relations in large commonsense knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, ATOMIC). Use knowledge graph completion and embedding alignment techniques to link latent model dimensions to knowledge graph nodes and edges, enabling explanations that reason about plausibility and common sense grounded in graph semantics for polysemous or ambiguous inputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select benchmark language understanding datasets with known ambiguities. 2) Run large transformer models and extract hidden states. 3) Align model latent features to knowledge graph embeddings via joint training. 4) Develop explanation modules that traverse linked knowledge graphs to justify model decisions. 5) Evaluate interpretability improvements quantitatively (e.g., user trust, disambiguation accuracy) and qualitatively (user studies). 6) Compare to baseline XAI methods without commonsense embedding.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence ‘He went to the bank.’ Expected output: Explanation that, using context, links 'bank' to relevant graph node (financial institution vs riverbank) and shows model reasoning path correlating with commonsense knowledge, clarifying ambiguous interpretation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If graph alignment is noisy, resort to rule-based heuristics for weak supervision of concept linking. Alternatively, pre-train embeddings separately and test modular fusion with model outputs before joint training."

        "title": "Commonsense Knowledge Graph Integration for Disambiguation in Language Model Interpretability with Neuro-Symbolic Embedding Alignment",
        "Problem_Statement": "Interpretability methods for natural language models frequently fail to incorporate structured commonsense knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in explaining ambiguous or context-dependent language understanding in a way that reflects human cognitive plausibility. Challenges arise from the difficulty in mapping continuous model latent representations to discrete, heterogeneous knowledge bases while resolving polysemy and granularity mismatches, thus restricting explainability depth and trustworthiness.",
        "Motivation": "While recent advances in language model interpretability have explored diverse approaches, current methods rarely integrate commonsense knowledge graphs in a principled, neuro-symbolic fashion to enhance explanations of ambiguous language phenomena. This proposal addresses the underexplored opportunity to tightly align transformer latent spaces with structured semantic networks such as ConceptNet and ATOMIC, using rigorous embedding alignment and graph-based reasoning. By leveraging neuro-symbolic AI principles, including Concept Activation Vectors and computational argumentation over knowledge graphs, our approach promises context-sensitive, cognitively plausible explanations that surpass existing techniques in semantic fidelity and user trust, offering a novel and scalable paradigm for explainability in state-of-the-art NLP models.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-component neuro-symbolic interpretability framework that jointly learns to align transformer model latent representations with structured commonsense knowledge graphs through a hybrid embedding alignment and attention-based reasoning mechanism. First, we extract layer-wise hidden states from a pretrained transformer (e.g., GPT-3) fine-tuned on an ambiguous language understanding dataset. Concurrently, knowledge graph embeddings are generated using state-of-the-art graph embedding techniques (e.g., ComplEx, Graph Attention Networks) from large, heterogeneous commonsense graphs (ConceptNet, ATOMIC). We introduce a Concept Activation Vector (CAV)-inspired projection layer trained to map continuous latent subspaces onto discrete concept dimensions of the knowledge graphs, optimized with dual objectives: 1) minimizing alignment loss (cosine similarity and cross-modal contrastive loss) between latent vectors and graph node embeddings representing semantically related concepts; and 2) enforcing disambiguation consistency through a semantic clustering loss that separates overlapping or nested concepts in latent space. Handling polysemy is addressed by context-conditioned gating modules that leverage transformer attention weights to dynamically select relevant graph subgraphs, thereby resolving granularity mismatches. We further integrate a computational argumentation component that traverses linked graph nodes and edges to build semantically interpretable explanation paths for model predictions. This modular system enables rigorous, cognitively plausible explanations grounded in semantic networks and validated through quantifiable metrics measuring explanation faithfulness and robustness. Preliminary feasibility is supported by pilot experiments demonstrating meaningful alignment between transformer latent subspaces and commonsense graph embeddings on controlled datasets.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Selection: Choose benchmark datasets with rich linguistic ambiguities and annotated ground-truth interpretations (e.g., Winograd Schema Challenge, Ambiguous NLI). 2) Model & Embeddings: Extract hidden states from pretrained transformers fine-tuned on these datasets; generate knowledge graph embeddings via Graph Attention Networks for ConceptNet and ATOMIC. 3) Alignment Training: Implement and train the CAV-inspired projection layer applying a combined loss function (cosine similarity, contrastive, and semantic clustering losses) with context-conditioned gating modules to handle polysemy. 4) Explanation Module Development: Build a computational argumentation system to extract explanatory reasoning paths from aligned knowledge graphs corresponding to model latent activations. 5) Incremental Validation: At each milestone, evaluate embedding alignment quality using quantitative metrics such as average cosine similarity between mapped vectors and concept embeddings, disambiguation accuracy (correctly identifying context-appropriate senses), and explanation faithfulness (correlation with model decision paths). 6) User Studies: Design statistically powered, reproducible user experiments to measure interpretability improvements, including objective disambiguation accuracy and subjective user trust and satisfaction metrics, controlled with and without commonsense-enriched explanations. 7) Resource and Scalability Planning: Plan GPU resource allocation, model training time estimates, and fallback strategies including separate pretraining of embeddings and modular fusion if joint training proves unstable. Each phase will document iterative refinements and quantitative/qualitative results to ensure feasibility and transparency.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence 'He went to the bank.' Context: 'to deposit his paycheck.' Expected output: Explanation pathway that maps the latent features representing 'bank' to the financial institution node in ConceptNet by activating corresponding Concept Activation Vectors, supported by contextual attention gating, demonstrating how model reasoning integrates commonsense semantics to resolve ambiguity. The explanation traces the sequence from ambiguous word embedding, through alignment to graph node 'financial institution,' corroborated with relations such as 'UsedFor depositing money,' verifying alignment fidelity and interpretability. Alternative ambiguous inputs will be similarly tested, including sentences with nested polysemy and semantically related concepts.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If joint multi-objective embedding alignment is noisy or unstable, we will pretrain language model latent-to-knowledge graph projection layers separately using an unsupervised contrastive pretraining scheme, followed by modular fusion with model outputs during explanation generation. Additionally, if polysemy resolution is insufficient, we will incorporate rule-based weak supervision heuristics and semantic interoperability constraints from ontology alignment methods to prune candidate graph nodes. Ensemble learning approaches combining multiple alignment models and computational argumentation modules will be explored to boost robustness. Finally, the framework can gracefully degrade to providing coarse-grained explanations emphasizing dominant semantic clusters when fine-grained mapping is infeasible, preserving utility and interpretability under resource constraints."

However, the core mechanism lacks clarity and detail, particularly regarding how latent dimensions in transformer models specifically map to discrete concepts and relations in large, heterogeneous knowledge graphs like ConceptNet or ATOMIC. It is unclear how the model will handle the polysemy of latent features or address potential mismatches in granularity and representation between continuous model states and symbolic graph nodes. To strengthen soundness, please clarify the precise techniques for embedding alignment, the objective functions used, and how the system will disambiguate overlapping or nested graph concepts to produce faithful explanations that are cognitively plausible and computationally tractable. Including preliminary results or a rationale for the feasibility of meaningful latent-graph mappings would also improve confidence in the approach's validity. This foundational mechanism underpins the entire pipeline; without a well-articulated and justified process, the overall method risks being too vague and may fail to realize its interpretability goals effectively. The section \"Proposed_Method\" must be expanded with concrete architectural details, training objectives, and handling of semantic mismatches to enhance clarity and rigor in how explanations are constructed from integrated knowledge graph semantics and latent model states. \n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is generally well-structured but omits critical practical considerations that could impact successful implementation. For instance, the plan entails aligning latent features of large transformer models to knowledge graph embeddings via joint training, a process known to be computationally intensive and potentially unstable given the difference in data modalities and representation granularity. There is no discussion of dataset scale, strategies for mitigating noise in alignment, or contingency plans if the joint embedding approach fails beyond fallback heuristics. Additionally, the evaluation metrics such as 'user trust' and 'disambiguation accuracy' are underspecified; more rigorous, reproducible quantification methods should be described, especially how user studies will be designed to isolate the effect of commonsense-enriched explanations. To ensure feasibility, the experiment plan should outline resource requirements, detailed methodology for embedding alignment (e.g., objectives, loss functions), and a timeline reflecting incremental milestones to verify intermediate successes (e.g., quality of alignment before explanation). Clarifying these points will facilitate practical execution, help anticipate challenges in scaling or optimization, and yield more reliable assessment of interpretability improvements. Thus, the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan should be expanded with these concrete adoptable best practices to bolster project feasibility and credibility. \n\nTarget section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
