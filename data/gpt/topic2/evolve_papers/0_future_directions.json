        "title": "Neuro-Semantic Cognitive Interpretability for Language Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current interpretability methods for language models often fail to capture human-like cognitive processes reflected in neural representational geometry and semantic priming phenomena, limiting cognitive plausibility and explanatory power.",
        "Motivation": "This project addresses the internal gap around lack of cognitive plausibility and the external gap connecting semantic hierarchies with cognitive representations. By integrating insights from neuroscience, psychology, and AI interpretability, the method aims to ground explanations in cognitive science evidence, greatly expanding beyond current domain-agnostic XAI approaches.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid interpretability framework combining representational similarity analysis (RSA) between language model activations and human brain imaging data with semantic priming-inspired contextual modulation of explanations. The approach will fuse fMRI-informed neural representational spaces with lexical semantic hierarchies (e.g., WordNet) to generate explanations that reveal which latent concepts and brain-like representations the model prioritizes per prediction, dynamically contextualized by semantic priming effects measured in human behavioral studies.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets combining language input, human fMRI responses (e.g., from published datasets), and semantic priming behavioral metrics. 2) Extract language model activations (GPT, BERT) for the same inputs. 3) Compute RSA between model and neural representations to identify aligned cognitive subspaces. 4) Integrate lexical ontologies to link these subspaces to semantic categories. 5) Develop explanation algorithms that highlight model components with high RSA scores modulated by priming context. 6) Evaluate using cognitive plausibility metrics, human judgment agreement, and standard interpretability benchmarks.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence ‘The cat chased the mouse.’ Context primed by ‘animal predator’. Expected output: Explanation highlighting model focus on 'animal behavior' latent dimensions consistent with human neural patterns and behavioral priming effects, showing enhanced interpretability grounded in cognitive science.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct RSA with fMRI data is inconclusive, fallback to using behavioral priming effect sizes and reaction times to proxy cognitive representations. Alternatively, utilize EEG datasets or simulate neural geometry through cognitive computational models to inform interpretability."

        "title": "Commonsense Knowledge Graph Integration for Disambiguation in Language Model Interpretability",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing language model interpretability techniques lack incorporation of structured commonsense knowledge, limiting their ability to explain ambiguous or context-dependent language understanding in a cognitively plausible manner.",
        "Motivation": "This idea harnesses the external gap identified: the underutilization of commonsense knowledge graphs and their integration into explainability models. By bridging semantic ontologies with structured knowledge bases, we can enhance depth and context-sensitivity of explanations, a novel direction with transformative potential.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a novel interpretability pipeline where explanation outputs are enriched by mapping language model internal states to concepts and relations in large commonsense knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, ATOMIC). Use knowledge graph completion and embedding alignment techniques to link latent model dimensions to knowledge graph nodes and edges, enabling explanations that reason about plausibility and common sense grounded in graph semantics for polysemous or ambiguous inputs.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select benchmark language understanding datasets with known ambiguities. 2) Run large transformer models and extract hidden states. 3) Align model latent features to knowledge graph embeddings via joint training. 4) Develop explanation modules that traverse linked knowledge graphs to justify model decisions. 5) Evaluate interpretability improvements quantitatively (e.g., user trust, disambiguation accuracy) and qualitatively (user studies). 6) Compare to baseline XAI methods without commonsense embedding.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence ‘He went to the bank.’ Expected output: Explanation that, using context, links 'bank' to relevant graph node (financial institution vs riverbank) and shows model reasoning path correlating with commonsense knowledge, clarifying ambiguous interpretation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If graph alignment is noisy, resort to rule-based heuristics for weak supervision of concept linking. Alternatively, pre-train embeddings separately and test modular fusion with model outputs before joint training."

        "title": "User-Adaptive Multi-Level Explanation Framework via Semi-Supervised Cognitive Profiling",
        "Problem_Statement": "Interpretability solutions often present generic, non-tailored explanations that fail to adapt to diverse user expertise and cognitive styles, reducing trustworthiness and usability across cognitive science and AI applications.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the opportunity to design minimal supervision-based user-centric explanatory systems, this project targets the gap in explanation personalization by exploiting semi-supervised learning to model user cognitive profiles dynamically, enabling multi-level explanations adapting to user needs and background.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Build a multi-tier explanation system that learns user cognitive style vectors via minimal interaction, using semi-supervised clustering on sparse data (questionnaires, interaction patterns). The system then dynamically adapts language model explanation granularity and format accordingly (e.g., visual vs textual, technical depth), leveraging reinforcement learning on user feedback signals to optimize interpretability alignment with individual cognitive preferences.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Recruit diverse users with varied backgrounds in cognitive science and AI. 2) Collect sparse user interaction data and explicit feedback on explanatory styles. 3) Train semi-supervised models to infer cognitive profiles. 4) Integrate profile-conditioned explanation generators with transformer interpretability modules. 5) Evaluate user satisfaction, comprehension, and trust metrics across baseline generic explanation models and the adaptive system.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Model prediction explanation of sentiment analysis as visual concept graph for expert cognitive scientist vs simplified metaphorical analogy for lay user, showing tailored explanation generated from learned profile.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If user profiling is insufficient from sparse data, incorporate transfer learning from larger cognitive style datasets. Alternatively, enable manual user selection of explanation type as a fallback."

        "title": "Hybrid Representational Geometry and Ontology-based Evaluation Benchmarks for Language Model Interpretability",
        "Problem_Statement": "Evaluation of language model interpretability is fragmented and lacks standardized, cognitively grounded benchmarks integrating neuroscience representational similarity and semantic ontology alignment.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the internal gap of inconsistent benchmarks and fragmented evaluation, this project proposes a novel benchmark suite combining RSA-driven neural data alignment and semantic ontology taxonomy coverage to systematically assess interpretability methods' cognitive fidelity.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a benchmark dataset containing aligned natural language inputs, cognitive neuroscience datasets (e.g., fMRI activations), and detailed semantic ontology annotations. Evaluate interpretability methods by quantifying RSA alignment scores between model and brain activations, alongside ontology-based metrics measuring explanation semantic coherence and hierarchy-consistency. This dual-metric suite enables comprehensive evaluation of interpretability models.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Aggregate existing datasets with aligned stimuli and brain/neural data. 2) Extend annotations with ontology-based semantic tags. 3) Implement baseline interpretability methods producing explanations. 4) Calculate RSA and ontology coherence metrics for these methods. 5) Publish benchmark and leaderboard to promote standardized evaluation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence ‘Birds can fly.’ Used in fMRI study and annotated in ontology. Expected evaluation: Explanation method with high RSA alignment to bird-related neural patterns and explanation components matching semantic hierarchy paths in ontologies scored higher.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If neuroscience data does not generalize well, supplement with behavioral similarity datasets or simulated cognitive models. Expand ontology coverage to more fine-grained semantic relations."

        "title": "Semantic Priming-Informed Contrastive Explanation for Ambiguous Language Understanding",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current explanations of language model predictions do not leverage semantic priming phenomena to contrastively elucidate why certain interpretations are favored over others, limiting interpretability depth.",
        "Motivation": "By embedding semantic priming effects into explanations, this idea innovates beyond static explanation to dynamic, contrastive reasoning grounded in cognitive behavioral data, bridging internal gaps of nuanced cognitive modeling in interpretability.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a contrastive explanation framework that generates paired explanations juxtaposing competing interpretations of ambiguous inputs. Use semantic priming behavioral statistics to weight components of the explanation, highlighting which aspects are cognitively facilitated in human comprehension, aligning model reasoning with priming-enhanced semantic associations.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate semantic priming datasets with ambiguous stimuli. 2) Obtain language model prediction variants over these stimuli. 3) Generate contrastive explanations identifying model internal features distinguishing interpretations. 4) Weight explanations by priming strength captured in behavioral data. 5) Evaluate alignment with human interpretability judgements through user studies.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Ambiguous phrase ‘The old man the boats.’ Expected output: Paired explanations contrasting ‘man’ as verb vs noun interpretation, with weights reflecting semantic priming, clarifying model’s chosen interpretation wrap.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If behavioral data is sparse, simulate priming-like effects using distributional semantic metrics or lexical co-occurrence statistics as proxies."
