In such contexts, a learned policy needs for instance to be interpretable, so that it can be inspected before any deployment (e.g., for safety and verifiability reasons). This survey provides an overview of various approaches to achieve higher interpretability in reinforcement learning (RL). To that aim, we distinguish interpretability (as an intrinsic property of a model) and explainability (as a post-hoc operation) and discuss them in the context of RL with an emphasis on the former notion. In particular, we argue that interpretable RL may embrace different facets: interpretable inputs, interpretable (transition/reward) models, and interpretable decision-making. Based on this scheme, we summarize and analyze recent work related to interpretable RL with an emphasis on papers published in the past 10 years. We also discuss briefly some related research areas and point to some potential promising research directions, notably related to the recent development of foundation models (e.g., large language models, RL from human feedback).'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models', 'abstract': 'By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve new state of the art scores for image inpainting and class-conditional image synthesis and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, text-to-image synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database', 'abstract': 'The explosion of image data on the Internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data. But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called “ImageNet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints', 'abstract': 'This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'LabelMe: A Database and Web-Based Tool for Image Annotation', 'abstract': 'Abstract\\nWe seek to build a large collection of images with ground truth labels to be used for object detection and recognition research. Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks', 'abstract': 'We investigate conditional adversarial networks as a general-purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems. These networks not only learn the mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Moreover, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, hundreds of twitter users have posted their own artistic experiments using our system. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Image Quality Assessment: From Error Visibility to Structural Similarity', 'abstract': 'Objective methods for assessing perceptual image quality traditionally attempted to quantify the visibility of errors (differences) between a distorted image and a reference image using a variety of known properties of the human visual system. Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept, we develop a Structural Similarity Index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation', 'abstract': 'Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build “fully convolutional” networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet [20]), the VGG net [1], and GoogLeNet [2]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning [3] to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20% relative improvement to 62.2% mean IV on 2012), NYVDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Deep Reinforcement Learning That Matters', 'abstract': 'In recent years, significant progress has been made in solving challenging problems across various domains using deep reinforcement learning (RL). Reproducing existing work and accurately judging the improvements offered by novel methods is vital to sustaining this progress. Unfortunately, reproducing results for state-of-the-art deep RL methods is seldom straightforward. In particular, non-determinism in standard benchmark environments, combined with variance intrinsic to the methods, can make reported results tough to interpret. Without significance metrics and tighter standardization of experimental reporting, it is difficult to determine whether improvements over the prior state-of-the-art are meaningful. In this paper, we investigate challenges posed by reproducibility, proper experimental techniques, and reporting procedures. We illustrate the variability in reported metrics and results when comparing against common baselines and suggest guidelines to make future results in deep RL more reproducible. We aim to spur discussion about how to ensure continued progress in the field by minimizing wasted effort stemming from results that are non-reproducible and easily misinterpreted.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Evaluating the Replicability of Significance Tests for Comparing Learning Algorithms', 'abstract': 'Empirical research in learning algorithms for classification tasks generally requires the use of significance tests. The quality of a test is typically judged on Type I error (how often the test indicates a difference when it should not) and Type II error (how often it indicates no difference when it should). In this paper we argue that the replicability of a test is also of importance. We say that a test has low replicability if its outcome strongly depends on the particular random partitioning of the data that is used to perform it. We present empirical measures of replicability and use them to compare the performance of several popular tests in a realistic setting involving standard learning algorithms and benchmark datasets. Based on our results we give recommendations on which test to use.'}]\n```\n\n**Part A.2: The Evolution Links (Edges of the Graph):**\nThe following list defines the citation relationships between the papers in Part A.

    "title": "Research Landscape Map for Using Contrastive Learning to Uncover Mechanistic Insights in Deep Language Models",
    "current_research_landscape": "The current research landscape in using contrastive learning to uncover mechanistic insights in deep language models centers on harnessing large-scale, hierarchically structured data resources analogous to those in computer vision, such as the semantic hierarchy of WordNet and large annotated datasets like ImageNet. This foundation supports supervised learning approaches to model and interpret semantic and structural relationships within complex data representations. Recent advances emphasize scalable annotation methods and minimal user supervision to facilitate robust object and concept detection, paralleling efforts in image synthesis and text-to-image synthesis domains. The evolution of the field has seen a shift from foundational dataset construction and annotation tools to sophisticated hierarchical and cross-modal representation learning, supported by methodological advancements in interpretable reinforcement learning and reproducibility frameworks. Central nodes such as ‘‘semantic hierarchy of WordNet,’’ ‘‘image annotation,’’ and ‘‘text-to-image synthesis’’ illustrate a focus on semantic structure, data curation, and generative modeling as core pillars underpinning current state-of-the-art approaches.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: The current body of work reveals a predominant emphasis on image-centric datasets and methodologies with limited direct exploration of mechanistic interpretability in deep language models, especially those leveraging contrastive learning paradigms. The field has not fully addressed the intrinsic challenges of mechanistic insight extraction in language models, relying instead on analogies to vision datasets and supervised learning approaches without developing domain-tailored interpretability frameworks. Furthermore, reproducibility and statistical rigor issues flagged in reinforcement learning remain underaddressed for language model interpretability. External/Novel Gaps: Cross-disciplinary opportunities remain largely untapped, especially the integration of hierarchical semantic knowledge (e.g., WordNet structures) with large collections of multimodal image and text data to improve mechanistic transparency in language models. The GPS analysis highlights missing bridges linking semantic hierarchies to text-to-image synthesis and image annotation, suggesting that leveraging representational geometry, cognitive robotics insights, and commonsense knowledge could enrich mechanistic interpretability frameworks. Additionally, concepts from behavioral judgments, neural representational geometry, and zero-shot cross-modal retrieval represent promising yet unexplored avenues to deepen mechanistic understanding.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "1. Hierarchically Structured Contrastive Learning Frameworks Incorporating Semantic Ontologies: Develop contrastive learning approaches that explicitly integrate semantic hierarchies from WordNet with annotated text and image corpora, enabling language models to uncover mechanistic representations aligned with human-understood ontologies. This directly addresses the gap in leveraging hierarchical semantic knowledge noted in the global context to improve interpretability.\n\n2. Multimodal Mechanistic Interpretability via Cross-Modal Embeddings and Commonsense Knowledge: Innovate contrastive learning models that bridge text, image, and conceptual data (e.g., commonsense knowledge graphs), exploiting global insights about cross-modal retrieval and cognitive robotics-inspired representations. This would tackle the identified lack of multimodal interpretability frameworks and integrate behavioral and representational geometry concepts for richer mechanistic insights.\n\n3. Robustness and Reproducibility Paradigms for Contrastive Interpretability in Language Models: Drawing from reinforcement learning reproducibility research, establish rigorous experimental and statistical methodologies (including replicability metrics and significance tests) tailored to mechanistic interpretability studies. This responds to internal reproducibility challenges and facilitates reliable validation of mechanistic discoveries in deep language models."
