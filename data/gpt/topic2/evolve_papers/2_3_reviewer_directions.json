    "title": "Genetic Testing Inspired Fidelity Metrics for AI-Generated Multilingual Scientific Texts",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluation metrics inadequately capture the fidelity and mutation robustness of AI-generated multilingual scientific texts, particularly concerning maintaining scientific accuracy after cross-lingual translation and generation steps.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by genetic testing methodologies, this project addresses the internal gap in systematic, transparent evaluation by introducing biologically motivated mutation and robustness testing frameworks for AI texts in underrepresented languages and domains.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a fidelity evaluation metric suite that treats AI-generated scientific texts as 'genomes,' introducing controlled perturbations (mutations) at lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels. The system measures robustness by analyzing the stability of scientific facts and meanings after mutations and re-translations, guiding model adjustments and generating reliability scores across languages and domains.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate multilingual scientific datasets with ground-truth annotations. 2. Define mutation operators mimicking genetic variability at linguistic levels. 3. Apply mutations to AI generated outputs and quantify semantic drift using domain-specific knowledge graphs. 4. Validate robustness scores with expert human assessments. 5. Compare fidelity metrics across existing language models and report correlations with downstream task performance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI-generated medical research summary in Arabic mutated by synonym substitutions and syntax shuffling. Expected Output: Fidelity score reflecting preservation of core scientific facts despite perturbations, highlighting vulnerabilities to certain mutation types.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct semantic drift estimation is too noisy, incorporate proxy evaluation via multiple human expert ratings. Alternatively, limit mutation scope to lexical substitutions and apply machine learning models to predict robustness from these simpler perturbations."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-MECHANISM",
          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method introduces a novel analogy between AI-generated texts and genomes by applying mutation operators at lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels. However, the mechanism lacks sufficient clarity on how these controlled perturbations realistically model the kinds of errors or variations seen in cross-lingual scientific text generation. Specifically, the method should detail the design and calibration of mutation operators to ensure they reflect plausible linguistic mutations rather than arbitrary noise. Additionally, the approach to measuring semantic drift via domain-specific knowledge graphs needs elaboration: how will the system quantify fact preservation or distortion robustly across different scientific domains and languages? Strengthening this mechanism will boost the soundness of the project and clarify its technical feasibility and innovation edge in a competitive field. This clarification is critical before proceeding with experiments, as it underpins the metric’s reliability and interpretability, which are central to the contribution's novelty and impact potential. Targeted experiments should validate these mutation operators' realism and the semantics drift quantification method upfront to build confidence in the approach's soundness and utility.  Suggestions for supplementing this include clearer algorithmic definitions, possibly with preliminary case demonstrations in the proposal stage, and more precise descriptions of knowledge graph usage and alignment with scientific fact verification across languages and domains.  This detailed mechanism description is essential to address the reviewer's concerns and to distinguish this approach from existing perturbation or robustness evaluation methods in NLP and AI-generated text analysis literature.  Without it, the novelty and impact claims may be questioned in peer review and competitive presentation contexts.  Hence, the authors should address SOU-MECHANISM first to improve clarity, credibility, and foundational rigor before refining experiment plans or scaling further impact claims.  This is a critical foundation for the proposed metric suite's success and comparative advantage in the competitive space of multilingual fidelity evaluation metrics for scientific texts.  In summary, the innovator must clearly specify and justify the mutation and semantic drift measurement mechanisms to render the proposed fidelity metrics method sound, interpretable, and compelling for downstream adoption and evaluation tasks in multilingual scientific NLP contexts.  This targeted articulation will in turn enable more confident feasibility assessments and clearer impact demonstrations subsequently.  Thus, addressing this core methodological clarity issue is the highest priority action at this stage in the research idea’s development cycle for maximal downstream benefits and acceptance potential in premier venues.  This critique focuses on clarifying mechanism rationale and operational details in the Proposed_Method section to firmly ground the approach scientifically and technically."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the idea's novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and its strong focus on fidelity metrics inspired by genetic mutation analogies, the project stands to gain considerable impact and distinctive novelty by integrating advances from globally linked concepts such as 'graph neural networks' and 'processes of language change.' Specifically, the authors could enhance their fidelity metric's semantic drift measurement by employing graph neural networks to model and track evolving semantic representations and linguistic mutations over 'generations of language users' or language change processes. This integration could powerfully capture subtle domain- and language-specific semantic shifts after perturbations and translations. Additionally, considering the 'structure of human language' and mechanisms of linguistic evolution embedded in the graph neural network architecture would provide a biologically and linguistically grounded refinement of mutation operators and robustness scores. By incorporating these state-of-the-art deep learning architectures and linguistic change theories, the project can sharpen its methodological novelty, improve fidelity estimation granularity, and broaden relevance from static mutation testing to dynamic language evolution simulations and analyses. Doing so would also directly address the challenge of evaluating underrepresented languages and scientific domains by leveraging cross-lingual graph structures and language user generations. Therefore, the innovator should consider extending their framework to fuse genetic mutation-inspired perturbations with graph neural network models and linguistic evolution insights. This global integration would differentiate the approach from existing robustness and fidelity metrics, enhancing competitiveness for premier venues like ACL or NeurIPS while delivering deeper scientific contributions and broader applicability. Implementing this suggestion naturally supports the project's soundness and feasibility goals by grounding mutations and semantic drift in robust, learned graph structures, enabling scalable evaluation with strong domain and language adaptability."
