    "title": "Neuro-Semantic Cognitive Interpretability for Language Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current interpretability methods for language models often fail to capture human-like cognitive processes reflected in neural representational geometry and semantic priming phenomena, limiting cognitive plausibility and explanatory power.",
    "Motivation": "This project addresses the internal gap around lack of cognitive plausibility and the external gap connecting semantic hierarchies with cognitive representations. By integrating insights from neuroscience, psychology, and AI interpretability, the method aims to ground explanations in cognitive science evidence, greatly expanding beyond current domain-agnostic XAI approaches.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid interpretability framework combining representational similarity analysis (RSA) between language model activations and human brain imaging data with semantic priming-inspired contextual modulation of explanations. The approach will fuse fMRI-informed neural representational spaces with lexical semantic hierarchies (e.g., WordNet) to generate explanations that reveal which latent concepts and brain-like representations the model prioritizes per prediction, dynamically contextualized by semantic priming effects measured in human behavioral studies.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets combining language input, human fMRI responses (e.g., from published datasets), and semantic priming behavioral metrics. 2) Extract language model activations (GPT, BERT) for the same inputs. 3) Compute RSA between model and neural representations to identify aligned cognitive subspaces. 4) Integrate lexical ontologies to link these subspaces to semantic categories. 5) Develop explanation algorithms that highlight model components with high RSA scores modulated by priming context. 6) Evaluate using cognitive plausibility metrics, human judgment agreement, and standard interpretability benchmarks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence ‘The cat chased the mouse.’ Context primed by ‘animal predator’. Expected output: Explanation highlighting model focus on 'animal behavior' latent dimensions consistent with human neural patterns and behavioral priming effects, showing enhanced interpretability grounded in cognitive science.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct RSA with fMRI data is inconclusive, fallback to using behavioral priming effect sizes and reaction times to proxy cognitive representations. Alternatively, utilize EEG datasets or simulate neural geometry through cognitive computational models to inform interpretability."

        "title": "Neuro-Semantic Cognitive Interpretability Integrating Pragmatic Speech Comprehension for Language Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current interpretability approaches for language models primarily focus on static semantic representations and fail to capture the dynamic, pragmatic cognitive processes involved in human speech comprehension, including the neural mechanisms of speaker’s intended meaning across bilateral brain regions. This limits their cognitive plausibility and the explanatory depth of language understanding models.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the critical cognitive gap, this project aims to extend interpretability beyond lexical semantics to pragmatics — human speech comprehension involving speaker intent recognition — by grounding explanations in multi-regional neural representational geometry and contextual discourse processing. By integrating neuroscience findings on bilateral brain activation patterns with advanced representational similarity analysis (RSA) and multimodal modeling, the proposed framework transcends existing domain-agnostic XAI methods. This enriched cognitive grounding enhances novelty and impact, distinguishing it fundamentally through its focus on dynamic, pragmatic language processing and biologically plausible multimodal cognition.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a comprehensive hybrid interpretability framework combining multi-level RSA of language model activations with human neural data capturing both semantic and pragmatic speech comprehension. This includes bilateral brain region fMRI data reflecting utterance-level processing of speaker’s intended meaning, complemented by EEG data capturing temporal dynamics. The method integrates lexical semantic ontologies with discourse-level pragmatic representations, leveraging deep generative models and convolutional neural networks specialized in speech and multimodal (e.g., face-processing) contexts to mimic biologically plausible architectures. Explainability algorithms will dynamically highlight latent dimensions related to semantic categories and pragmatic intent, contextualized by behavioral semantic priming and speech comprehension metrics. This produces cognitively and neurally grounded, temporally informed explanations of how language models process meaning in context.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Identify and select publicly available multimodal datasets harmonizing language input with human neural responses: specifically fMRI datasets capturing bilateral brain regions during speech comprehension tasks involving speaker intent (e.g., story listening tasks), EEG datasets with temporally high-resolution recordings during related semantic priming and pragmatic tasks, and complementary behavioral datasets containing semantic priming and pragmatic comprehension metrics. 2) Curate a carefully aligned subset of stimuli common across these datasets to ensure cross-modal comparability and ecological validity. 3) Extract activations from pretrained language models (e.g., GPT, BERT) and deep generative or CNN models trained on speech and face-processing to capture multimodal aspects. 4) Perform multi-level RSA: (a) between model and fMRI activation patterns focusing on bilateral temporal and frontal regions associated with pragmatic processing, (b) between model dynamics and EEG temporal signatures to capture time-resolved semantic-priming effects, and (c) behavioral correlations with priming and pragmatic comprehension scores. 5) Fuse ontology-based lexical-semantic hierarchies with discourse-level pragmatic representations to link aligned cognitive subspaces to speaker intent and context. 6) Develop dynamic explanation algorithms that leverage these aligned subspaces to highlight model components implicated in both semantic and pragmatic interpretability, incorporating multimodal cues. 7) Validate explanations through cognitive plausibility metrics, human judgment agreement studies with expert annotators on pragmatic interpretability, and established interpretability benchmarks. Timelines include a pilot phase (months 1–6) focusing on stimulus alignment and initial RSA feasibility analyses, followed by full-scale multimodal integration (months 7–18), with fallback pipelines relying on EEG and computational cognitive models elaborated for handling potential fMRI temporal resolution limitations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Utterance 'The cat chased the mouse.' preceded by a dialogue context priming 'animal predator behavior' and speaker intent suggesting urgency. Expected output: An explanation highlighting model activation of latent dimensions related not only to 'animal behavior' semantics but also to pragmatic aspects like speaker urgency and intent recognition, consistent with neural activation patterns across bilateral temporal and frontal brain regions and aligned with behavioral priming effects. This shows enhanced interpretability tightly grounded in complex cognitive mechanisms encompassing semantic and pragmatic language comprehension.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If fMRI data proving challenging due to temporal resolution or stimulus alignment, fallback to high-temporal-resolution EEG datasets focusing on semantic and pragmatic priming dynamics. Alternatively, use computational cognitive models simulating neural representational geometry of speech comprehension to approximate bilateral brain activity. Integrate these models with behavioral priming and pragmatic comprehension metrics to sustain rigorous testing of cognitive interpretability hypotheses. Employ multimodal deep generative and CNN architectures trained on speech and face-processing datasets as proxies to simulate biologically plausible representational structures, ensuring continued methodological robustness despite data limitations."

Public fMRI datasets often vary in task design, population, and stimulus sets, which may not align straightforwardly with available semantic priming metrics or lexical ontologies. Clarify how you will harmonize stimuli and participant contexts across neuroscience and behavioral datasets to ensure meaningful representational similarity analysis (RSA). Additionally, fMRI’s low temporal resolution challenges correlating neural geometry with dynamic semantic priming effects, so the fallback plan mentioning EEG and computational models should be elaborated with concrete alternative pipelines or metrics. Providing timeline and resource assessments for these complex multimodal steps will also enhance feasibility understanding. Overall, a more detailed data integration and validation strategy is needed to confirm the experiment plan can rigorously test the cognitive interpretability hypotheses proposed, thereby strengthening your submission’s empirical viability and credibility in a competitive space of multimodal interpretability studies. \n\nSuggestions include pilot analyses focusing on a subset of well-aligned stimuli across datasets, or specifying candidate public datasets with compatible semantic priming tasks to demonstrate initial feasibility before full-scale experiments.—target section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

Incorporate representational similarity analyses not only for isolated semantic categories but also for contextualized utterance-level interpretations reflecting speaker intent, leveraging bilateral brain region activation patterns documented in neuroscience literature. This addition could ground explanations in more nuanced cognitive processes involving discourse and intention recognition, augmenting alignment with complex cognitive processes beyond lexical semantics. Furthermore, exploring deep generative models or convolutional neural networks specialized in speech or face-processing networks (for multimodal grounded context) can enrich the interpretability framework with biologically and cognitively plausible architectures. Such integration will differentiate your approach by bridging fine-grained representational geometry with communicative intent and multimodal cognition, increasing the impact and widening applicability while addressing novelty concerns flagged in the competitive review.—target section: Overall Concept and Proposed_Method"
