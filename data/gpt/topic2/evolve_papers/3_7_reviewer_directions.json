    "title": "Zero-Shot Cross-Modal Contrastive Interpretability via Behavioral Judgment Modelling",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of frameworks that employ behavioral judgment data to interpret mechanistic structures in language model embeddings across modalities without supervised labels.",
    "Motivation": "This tackles the novel external gap by incorporating human behavioral judgment data (e.g., similarity or relatedness ratings) as weak supervision for zero-shot contrastive learning to reveal mechanistic insights that align with human cognition across modalities.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Collect behavioral judgments correlating textual and visual stimuli, then use these similarity scores to construct contrastive pairs weighted by human perception. Train cross-modal language-vision models that learn mechanistic representational structures explaining human judgments without explicit task supervision.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Aggregate datasets of behavioral similarity judgments; 2) Create weighted contrastive objectives; 3) Train cross-modal embeddings; 4) Evaluate alignment with human judgment via correlation metrics; 5) Perform interpretability probing to link embeddings to mechanistic features.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Pairs of animal names and images with human-rated similarity scores; Expected Output: Embedding distances reflect human judgment distributions, enabling mechanistic interpretation consistent with cognitive expectations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "In case of scarce behavioral data, generate synthetic judgments via model ensembles or gather crowdsourced small datasets for transfer learning."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The foundational assumption that behavioral judgment data (e.g., similarity ratings) can robustly serve as weak supervision to reveal mechanistic structures in language model embeddings warrants deeper justification. Human similarity judgments are inherently subjective and can vary widely across individuals and contexts, potentially introducing noise or bias into the contrastive learning process. Clarifying how you will control for such variability, ensure reliability, and validate that these judgments meaningfully correspond to mechanistic model representations is critical for soundness. Additionally, the assumption that these heterogeneous behavioral signals can align coherently across modalities without explicit labels should be further substantiated with preliminary evidence or theoretical grounding to confirm viability in practice, especially given the zero-shot nature of the learning formulation. This will help strengthen the argument that the approach is well-founded rather than speculative or overly optimistic from the start. Please elaborate on these core presuppositions in the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections to enhance conceptual clarity and rigor, possibly by reviewing related cognitive modeling and interpretability literature that links behavioral data to internal model features reliably and robustly at scale.  Your working hypotheses must better recognize and mitigate the risks of noisy and sparse behavioral data influencing interpretability claims if left unaddressed."

        {
          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "While the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is logically structured, practical challenges threaten feasibility that should be proactively addressed. Aggregating behavioral similarity judgments across diverse textual and visual domains that suitably map onto mechanistic features is non-trivialâ€”existing datasets may be limited in size, modality coverage, or annotation consistency. The fallback plan is reasonable but vague; specifying concrete sources or methodologies (e.g., particular crowdsourcing platforms, quality control protocols, or ensemble model architectures to generate synthetic data) would greatly increase practical confidence. The plan should also detail how you will validate that the weighted contrastive objectives effectively incorporate human judgment variations rather than amplifying noise, possibly via ablation or robustness checks. Moreover, interpretability probing methods to link embeddings to mechanistic insights are mentioned but need elaboration on metrics, probing techniques, or evaluation baselines to ensure their outputs are scientifically meaningful rather than post-hoc rationalizations. Please enrich the Experiment_Plan with targeted, concrete feasibility mitigation strategies and clearer success criteria, enabling a more actionable and credible roadmap that reduces risk and clarifies effort."
