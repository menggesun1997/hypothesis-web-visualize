    "title": "Participatory Co-Design Platform for Language Model Concept Trustworthiness",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a void in participatory co-design approaches engaging domain experts to enhance the transparency, interpretability, and trustworthiness of AI-concept formation, decreasing stakeholder confidence in model outputs.",
    "Motivation": "This idea tackles the external gap of non-existent participatory approaches directly, leveraging cross-disciplinary collaboration to build model transparency and improve ethical compliance in sensitive sectors like finance and healthcare.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an interactive co-design platform that allows domain experts to iteratively annotate, critique, and guide language model concept generation processes. The platform incorporates explainability tools producing interpretable concept formation rationale maps and an audit trail for ethical and bias assessments.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collaborate with experts in finance and biomedical informatics.\n2) Develop user interface integrating explainability visualization.\n3) Conduct user studies measuring trust and output quality improvements.\n4) Analyze collaborative changes to model prompts and configurations.\n5) Formalize participatory protocols for model validation workflows.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "'Input: Domain expert reviews AI-generated organizational transformation strategy draft.\nExpected Output: Annotated explanations and iterative revisions that improve conceptual coherence and reduce unwarranted generalizations, fostering expert trust.'",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct co-design faces engagement bottlenecks, incorporate crowd-sourced domain proxy validators or simulated expert feedback to bootstrap the platform's utility."
