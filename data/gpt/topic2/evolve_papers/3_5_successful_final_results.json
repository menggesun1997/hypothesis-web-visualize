        "title": "Dynamic Hierarchical Contrastive Learning with Temporal Semantic Evolution for Real-World Knowledge Graphs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Static semantic hierarchies like WordNet do not incorporate semantic evolution over time and lack grounding in dynamic, socially rich real-world data, limiting mechanistic interpretability of language models applied to evolving language contexts such as social media or electronic health records. Existing contrastive learning methods do not explicitly model temporal semantic shifts in a hierarchically structured and quantitatively interpretable manner.",
        "Motivation": "To address the competitive and evolving landscape of semantic representation learning, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework that dynamically integrates temporally evolving semantic hierarchies derived from real-world knowledge graphs encompassing social media and electronic health records data. By embedding temporal semantic drift directly into hierarchical contrastive objectives with explicit quantitative weighting schemes, we enable language models to mechanistically track complex semantic evolution, including lexical shifts, aspect-based sentiment changes, and semantic role transformations. This approach advances interpretability and temporal robustness beyond traditional static ontologies and lexical semantic change models, unlocking applications in mental health and sentiment analysis with explainable embeddings.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We introduce a Dynamic Hierarchical Temporal Contrastive Learning (DHTCL) framework with the following key components:\n\n1. Construction of time-stamped semantic hierarchy snapshots from real-world knowledge graphs extracted from social media and EHR data, capturing domain-specific semantic shifts, including semantic role labeling and aspect-based sentiment properties.\n\n2. Formalization of temporal weighting functions W(t,i,j) applied to contrastive loss terms, where i,j are concept embeddings at time t, dynamically computed based on semantic drift metrics (e.g., embedding neighborhood changes, graph transformation scores) quantifying hierarchy evolution phases.\n\n3. Algorithmic sampling of positive and negative pairs conditioned on temporal semantic proximity and hierarchical relations, incorporating phase-specific hard negatives mined via graph analysis.\n\n4. The final temporal contrastive loss L_t at time t is defined as:\n\n   L_t = - \\sum_{(i,j) \\in P_t} W(t,i,j) \\cdot \\log \\frac{exp(sim(z_i, z_j) / \\tau)}{\\sum_{k \\in N_t(i)} exp(sim(z_i, z_k) / \\tau)}\n\nwhere P_t is positive pairs set, N_t(i) the negative candidate set, sim() the cosine similarity, and \\tau a temperature parameter.\n\n5. Mechanistic interpretability is operationalized via embedding space diagnostics linking embedding shifts quantitatively to known semantic drift phases per hierarchy snapshot, enabling explainable temporal repositioning.\n\nPseudocode and mathematical formulations detailing the weighting computation, pair sampling strategy, and loss integration are provided to ensure reproducibility and to differentiate from existing frameworks.\n\nThis approach integrates semantic role and aspect-based sentiment labeling from external NLP pipelines into knowledge graph construction to enrich semantic hierarchies beyond lexical relations.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Extract and construct time-aware semantic hierarchies from social media and EHR-based knowledge graphs, incorporating semantic role labels and sentiment aspects;\n2) Compute semantic drift metrics over temporal slices to formulate dynamic temporal weighting functions;\n3) Implement dynamic hierarchical temporal contrastive learning with weighted loss and time-conditioned pair sampling;\n4) Evaluate embeddings on downstream tasks involving lexical semantic change detection, mental health signal prediction, and aspect-based sentiment analysis with temporal robustness;\n5) Perform embedding space mechanistic analyses linking embedding trajectories to temporal semantic evolution, validating interpretability claims;\n6) Conduct ablation studies comparing static vs. dynamic weighting and hierarchical vs. heterogeneous graph integration.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input 1: Social media posts using the term \"depressed\" from 2010 and 2023; Expected Output 1: Embeddings reflect enriched semantic shift by repositioning in embedding space aligned with evolving clinical and colloquial usages, interpretable via hierarchy drift metrics.\n\nInput 2: Clinical note excerpts mentioning \"anxiety\" at multiple timestamps; Expected Output 2: Embeddings capture temporal semantic role and sentiment aspect shifts mechanistically, improving mental health prediction task performance.\n\nInput 3: Aspect-based sentiment sentences from product reviews in 2015 and 2022; Expected Output 3: Embedding evolution accurately reflects sentiment polarity drifts and semantic role shifts with hierarchical guidance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-world knowledge graphs or semantic role/sentiment labeling pipelines prove noisy or unavailable, fallback to constructing temporally-binned ontologies from curated diachronic corpora and embedding-based distributional semantic change metrics. Employ expert-validated subsets of semantic shifts for weighting schemes and limit contrastive pair sampling to high-confidence semantic changes. Complement with unsupervised graph transformation scores to approximate hierarchy evolution, ensuring the core framework's applicability under resource constraints."

Clarification is needed on how these temporal semantic hierarchy snapshots will quantitatively influence the contrastive loss and how mechanistic interpretability is operationalized and measured within the learned representations. Strengthening this mechanism explanation will bolster the soundness of the approach and its reproducibility potential. Consider providing algorithmic pseudocode or mathematical formulations that explicitly define the temporal weighting scheme and the construction of positive/negative pairs conditioned on semantic evolution phases to improve clarity and rigor in your method section (Proposed_Method). This will also help differentiate it from existing contrastive frameworks in this competitive area and address assumptions about temporal hierarchy availability and quality (Problem_Statement)."

This practical grounding could enable novel applications in mental health analysis or sentiment analysis by leveraging your mechanistic embeddings to improve interpretability and temporal robustness in downstream NLP tasks. Further, linking to semantic role labeling or aspect-based sentiment analysis could open deeper semantic interpretability avenues beyond lexical semantic change. Such integration would address the competitiveness noted and broaden potential impact dramatically, aligning with several globally linked concepts and expanding beyond static word sense shifts to complex semantic phenomena in dynamic, real-world contexts."
