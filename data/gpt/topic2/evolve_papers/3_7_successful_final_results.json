        "title": "Robust Zero-Shot Cross-Modal Contrastive Interpretability via Human Behavioral Judgment Modeling with Reliability Controls",
        "Problem_Statement": "Interpreting the mechanistic structures underlying multimodal language-vision embeddings remains challenging, especially in zero-shot scenarios without explicit supervised labels. Prior efforts leveraging behavioral judgment data—such as human similarity ratings—face significant hurdles due to inherent subjectivity, inter-individual variability, and contextual influences, which can introduce noise and bias. This undermines the reliability of such data as weak supervision for revealing meaningful mechanistic features in learned representations across modalities. Moreover, the assumption that heterogeneous behavioral signals can align coherently with internal model representations in a cross-modal zero-shot setting requires rigorous justification. Therefore, this proposal aims to critically address these concerns by incorporating robust reliability controls and validation strategies to ensure that behavioral judgments genuinely reflect mechanistic cognitive alignments and by demonstrating this in pre-trained deep neural nets for vision-and-language tasks.",
        "Motivation": "This work fills a crucial gap in interpretability research by systematically integrating human behavioral similarity judgments as a novel, biologically inspired weak supervision signal for cross-modal representation learning and explanation. Unlike prior methods that rely on explicit task supervision or purely model-internal metrics, our approach leverages human cognition-grounded data to reveal mechanistic structures consistent with human knowledge representation and processing. By embedding stringent reliability checks, leveraging advanced representation alignment techniques, and incorporating cognitive modeling insights, this project pushes beyond competitive baselines to establish a principled framework that enhances interpretability in pre-trained language-vision models and benefits intelligent decision-making applications, such as emotion analysis and video recognition.",
        "Proposed_Method": "First, we collect and curate behavioral similarity datasets encompassing paired textual and visual stimuli, emphasizing quality and representativeness across modalities. We apply rigorous pre-processing steps, including inter-rater reliability analysis (e.g., using intraclass correlation coefficients), normalization, and removal of outlier judgments to mitigate noise and subjectivity. Next, inspired by knowledge representation learning and multi-modal fusion mechanisms, we construct weighted contrastive learning objectives where pair weights reflect aggregated, reliability-controlled human judgments, reinforcing mechanistic alignment across modalities without explicit labels in a zero-shot manner. To ensure robustness and reduce overfitting to noisy data, we incorporate adversarial robustness techniques in the training of deep neural nets with pre-trained language and vision backbones, enforcing smoothness and stability in representation spaces. We also design hierarchical probing methods combining clustering validation metrics such as the Calinski-Harabasz index and Davies-Bouldin score to quantitatively assess embedding structures' alignment with human cognitive groupings. Finally, we validate our method's effectiveness versus baselines via ablations exploring the impact of behavioral data reliability, synthetic judgment augmentation via model ensemble predictions, and cross-domain transfer to tasks like emotion and intelligent decision-making analysis.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Aggregate and preprocess behavioral similarity judgment datasets from sources such as crowd-annotated platforms (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) and curated psychological studies, ensuring modality balance and domain diversity; 2) Assess judgment reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients and apply filtering to exclude low-agreement items; 3) Create weighted contrastive loss functions incorporating these reliability-weighted human judgments; 4) Train cross-modal embeddings using pre-trained language and vision transformer backbones enhanced with adversarial robustness regularizers to stabilize learned representations; 5) Perform ablation studies to examine the effects of judgment noise, dataset size, and synthetic data augmentation from model ensemble predictions serving as fallback; 6) Employ interpretability probing combining clustering metrics (Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin) and canonical correlation analysis to quantitatively link embeddings to cognitive groupings; 7) Benchmark on downstream vision-and-language tasks related to emotion analysis and video recognition to demonstrate transferability and practical impact; 8) Document robustness of findings and refine based on empirical insights.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Pairs of animal names and animal images with crowdsourced human-rated similarity scores normalized and filtered for reliability (ICC > 0.75). Expected Output: The learned cross-modal embedding distances systematically correlate with these human ratings (Spearman's rho > 0.7), cluster semantically coherent groups with high Calinski-Harabasz scores, and align with cognitive semantic categories revealed by canonical correlation analysis. This enables mechanistic interpretation consistent with known cognitive and neural representation theories in vision and language processing.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If existing behavioral data are insufficient in scale or coverage, we will generate synthetic judgments via ensemble predictions from multiple pre-trained language and vision models, calibrated through uncertainty estimation to approximate human-like similarity patterns. Small-scale crowdsourcing campaigns with rigorous quality controls and inter-rater calibration protocols will be launched to gather targeted supplemental judgments. Ablation experiments will help us understand and mitigate the influence of noisy or synthetic data on interpretability claims, including applying noise-aware regularization techniques during contrastive training. This stepwise approach ensures reliability preservation even under data scarcity scenarios."

          "feedback_content": "The foundational assumption that behavioral judgment data (e.g., similarity ratings) can robustly serve as weak supervision to reveal mechanistic structures in language model embeddings warrants deeper justification. Human similarity judgments are inherently subjective and can vary widely across individuals and contexts, potentially introducing noise or bias into the contrastive learning process. Clarifying how you will control for such variability, ensure reliability, and validate that these judgments meaningfully correspond to mechanistic model representations is critical for soundness. Additionally, the assumption that these heterogeneous behavioral signals can align coherently across modalities without explicit labels should be further substantiated with preliminary evidence or theoretical grounding to confirm viability in practice, especially given the zero-shot nature of the learning formulation. This will help strengthen the argument that the approach is well-founded rather than speculative or overly optimistic from the start. Please elaborate on these core presuppositions in the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections to enhance conceptual clarity and rigor, possibly by reviewing related cognitive modeling and interpretability literature that links behavioral data to internal model features reliably and robustly at scale.  Your working hypotheses must better recognize and mitigate the risks of noisy and sparse behavioral data influencing interpretability claims if left unaddressed."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "While the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is logically structured, practical challenges threaten feasibility that should be proactively addressed. Aggregating behavioral similarity judgments across diverse textual and visual domains that suitably map onto mechanistic features is non-trivial—existing datasets may be limited in size, modality coverage, or annotation consistency. The fallback plan is reasonable but vague; specifying concrete sources or methodologies (e.g., particular crowdsourcing platforms, quality control protocols, or ensemble model architectures to generate synthetic data) would greatly increase practical confidence. The plan should also detail how you will validate that the weighted contrastive objectives effectively incorporate human judgment variations rather than amplifying noise, possibly via ablation or robustness checks. Moreover, interpretability probing methods to link embeddings to mechanistic insights are mentioned but need elaboration on metrics, probing techniques, or evaluation baselines to ensure their outputs are scientifically meaningful rather than post-hoc rationalizations. Please enrich the Experiment_Plan with targeted, concrete feasibility mitigation strategies and clearer success criteria, enabling a more actionable and credible roadmap that reduces risk and clarifies effort."
