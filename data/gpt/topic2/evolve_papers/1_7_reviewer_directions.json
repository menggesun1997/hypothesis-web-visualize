    "title": "Multimodal Few-Shot Scientific Concept Learning via Masked Attention Fusion",
    "Problem_Statement": "Few-shot learning for complex scientific concepts that appear across multiple modalities—text, diagrams, images—is underexplored, hindering adaptive scientific language models.",
    "Motivation": "Combines critical gap regarding few-shot prompting challenges with the innovation opportunity to unify mask transformers across modalities using dynamic feature fusion.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a masked attention fusion network where masked token and region embeddings from each modality are fused via gated attention layers that optimally weight cross-modal information. The masking mechanism simulates occlusion learned from few-shot examples to enhance robustness. The model supports rapid adaptation to new scientific concepts with minimal labeled multimodal data.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Collect few-shot datasets with paired scientific images, text and diagrams for novel concepts. (2) Train fusion transformer with masked attention and gating mechanisms for multimodal reconstruction and classification tasks. (3) Evaluate rapid adaptation capabilities on few-shot benchmarks. (4) Compare to uni- and multimodal few-shot baselines on accuracy and adaptation speed.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Few-shot examples of a new microscopy pattern described by text and image followed by unseen inputs. Expected output: Model accurately segments and classifies instances of the new scientific concept with minimal examples.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If gating mechanisms overfit, incorporate regularization or meta-learning approaches. Alternatively, combine with external memory modules for concept retention."
