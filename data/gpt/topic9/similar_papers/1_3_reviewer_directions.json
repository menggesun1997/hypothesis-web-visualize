    "title": "Cross-Lingual Knowledge Distillation from Graph-Enhanced LLMs for Ultra Low-Resource Languages",
    "Problem_Statement": "Extreme low-resource languages suffer from lack of training data and effective model transfer; current models underutilize graph-based semantic structures and cross-lingual transfer learning for knowledge distillation.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap on combining structured semantic knowledge and zero-shot/few-shot learning to mitigate data scarcity by proposing a knowledge distillation framework from graph-enhanced large language models to lightweight student models for ultra low-resource languages.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We design a two-stage knowledge distillation process where a teacher model enriched with graph neural network embeddings guides a smaller student model specialized for an unseen ultra low-resource language. The teacher uses joint graph and language model attention to produce semantic-rich outputs, which are distilled via soft targets and intermediate representation alignment. This enables the student model to inherit both deep semantic reasoning and cross-lingual zero-shot capabilities without requiring annotated data.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Train teacher model with graph encoders and foundation language models on high-resource languages. 2) Select ultra low-resource languages with minimal or no labels. 3) Distill knowledge to student model using unlabeled data and pseudo-labeling. 4) Measure performance on downstream tasks like stance and misinformation detection. 5) Baseline against direct fine-tuning and multilingual pretraining. 6) Metrics: accuracy, model size, inference speed, sample efficiency.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A text snippet in a rare language (e.g., Hiri Motu) needing stance classification. Expected output: Student model accurately classifies stance with performance close to teacher, despite the absence of annotated data in the target language.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If distillation fails, integrate unsupervised pretraining steps on target language data or use multilingual adapters to inject language-specific capacity. Alternatively, augment data with synthetic samples generated by multilingual LLMs."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section outlines a two-stage knowledge distillation approach leveraging graph-enhanced teacher models to guide student models for ultra low-resource languages. However, the mechanism lacks clarity on how the graph neural network embeddings are effectively integrated across typologically diverse languages. Details on the joint attention mechanism between graph and language model components and how intermediate representation alignment preserves semantic richness without annotated data need to be expanded to establish methodological soundness. Explicit formulation or schematic illustration of these interactions would strengthen the conceptual clarity and reproducibility of the approach, ensuring reviewers and future researchers can fully understand and assess the feasibility of the semantic transfer mechanism across languages with scarce resources. Consider including more precise descriptions of architecture, loss functions for intermediate alignment, and how zero-shot capabilities are concretely achieved through distillation rather than fine-tuning or adapters alone in the Proposed_Method section."

          "feedback_content": "While the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is logically ordered and covers key stages from teacher training to evaluation, it is not sufficiently detailed in its treatment of several practical challenges inherent to ultra low-resource languages. For example, the plan should explicitly address the source and quality of unlabeled data for student model distillation, the criteria for selecting ultra low-resource languages, and how pseudo-labeling quality and potential noise will be managed. Additionally, it lacks a clear strategy for controlling confounding factors in baseline comparisons (i.e., between distillation and direct fine-tuning). The usage of metrics such as accuracy and inference speed is good, but consideration of robustness and generalization across dialects or linguistic domains would be beneficial. It is recommended to expand the experiment plan to include ablation studies for each distillation component, error analysis methods, and contingency plans for data scarcity scenarios outlined in the fallback plan, thereby increasing the feasibility and scientific rigor of the experimentation."
