    "title": "Multimodal Explainability for Legal AI Combining Text and Visual Evidence",
    "Problem_Statement": "Explainability for legal AI models predominantly focuses on textual explanations, but many legal decisions rely on visual evidence (e.g., signatures, diagrams) which remains underexplored, limiting holistic interpretability.",
    "Motivation": "Filling a novel cross-domain gap, this work synthesizes multimodal XAI techniques from biomedical informatics and cybersecurity (which integrate image-text explainability) to create hybrid explanation models that enhance understanding of complex legal documents combining text and visuals.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multimodal explainability architecture that aligns textual explanations from legal LLMs with visual evidence highlighted via attention maps and concept attribution. Incorporate cross-modal explanation fusion modules that provide coherent, synchronized explanations. The system supports user-controlled interaction to explore explanations across modalities, improving legal reasoning transparency.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather multimodal legal datasets containing text and associated visual evidence (e.g., signed contracts with annotations). 2) Train joint multimodal legal LLMs with explanation capabilities. 3) Implement attention and attribution techniques for both modalities. 4) Develop fusion methods to integrate textual and visual explanation outputs. 5) Evaluate against unimodal baselines on user trust, explanation completeness, and decision support metrics with legal experts.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Contract clause alongside handwritten signature image. Output: Explanation highlighting key textual clauses and visual evidence authenticity concerns with aligned attention visuals and textual rationales for each modality.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal fusion reduces explanation clarity, offer separate modality explanations synchronized by time and content. Alternatively, integrate stepwise explanations where visual evidence explanation precedes textual rationale or vice versa. Experiment with different fusion architectures to optimize interpretability."

Specifically, gathering multimodal legal datasets with high-quality annotations combining text and visual evidence (e.g., handwritten signatures, diagrams) is a nontrivial challenge that needs clearer sourcing or creation strategy. The proposal should specify concrete dataset candidates or a detailed annotation framework to ensure availability and suitability. Moreover, training joint multimodal legal LLMs with explanation capabilities demands significant computational resources and may face domain adaptation hurdles; the plan should mention preliminary steps like model selection, transfer learning from existing multimodal models, or modular prototyping. Lastly, the evaluation protocol should be expanded beyond high-level metrics to include concrete user study designs with legal experts, detailing participant selection, tasks, and quantitative and qualitative assessment methods to robustly measure trust and explanation completeness. These enhancements will improve experimental soundness and practical feasibility substantially.\n\n---\n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict (NOV-COMPETITIVE) and the idea's ambition to fuse textual and visual explainability in legal AI, a promising direction is to integrate advanced concept retrieval techniques and rigorously apply sanity checks within the explanation modules. Leveraging concept retrieval could yield more semantically meaningful and legally grounded explanations by aligning explanations with established legal concepts rather than only low-level features. Similarly, embedding sanity check protocols will improve explanation reliability, addressing concerns in XAI about spurious attention or artifact-driven explanations. Additionally, exploring joint training with data fusion methods from related domains like biomedical informatics and multi-sensor fusion could enrich the fusion module, enhancing coherent cross-modal reasoning. This strategic global integration promises to elevate both novelty and impact, differentiating the model in this competitive area.\n\n---\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
