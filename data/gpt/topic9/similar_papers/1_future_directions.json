        "title": "SemanticTokenFuse: Linguistically Meaningful Tokens for Efficient Tuning in Low-Resource Languages",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current tuning methods for large language models in low-resource languages rely heavily on random token embeddings that lack semantic meaningfulness, reducing tuning efficiency and generalization capabilities.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the internal gap regarding the limited semantic meaningfulness and efficiency of current tuning tokens by integrating zero-shot semantic information to replace random tokens, aligning with Opportunity 1 that suggests integrating zero-shot semantic knowledge with prompt tuning for enhanced low-resource language understanding.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a SemanticTokenFuse framework that leverages pretrained multilingual semantic embeddings to replace random tokens in the parameter-efficient tuning process. This method integrates semantic knowledge graphs extracted from low-resource languages to generate linguistically meaningful embeddings used as tuning tokens. Our framework dynamically fuses these semantic tokens during prompt tuning, enabling the model to generalize better in zero-shot or few-shot scenarios by grounding the representations in meaningful language-specific concepts rather than arbitrary token vectors.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect low-resource multilingual datasets (e.g. Amharic, Quechua) from public sources. 2) Extract semantic knowledge graphs using dependency parsing and multilingual lexical databases. 3) Generate semantic token embeddings aligned with the knowledge graph nodes. 4) Replace random tuning tokens with generated semantic tokens in parameter-efficient tuning of a multilingual foundation model such as mBERT or XLM-R. 5) Baseline comparisons with standard prompt tuning and random token tuning methods. 6) Evaluate on downstream tasks including stance detection and misinformation identification using metrics like accuracy, F1, and robustness to domain shifts.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Fake news claim about health in Amharic' with an associated semantic graph embedding of health-related concepts. Expected output: Model correctly classifies the claim as fake with higher confidence and fewer training examples than random token tuning baselines.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If semantic tokens do not improve tuning efficiency, fallback to hybrid tokens combining random and semantic embeddings. Alternatively, apply dimensionality reduction techniques on the semantic graph to simplify embeddings or explore self-supervised pretraining of semantic tokens before tuning."

        "title": "Graph-FM Zero-Shot Fusion: Bridging Graph Neural Networks and Foundation Models for Cross-Lingual Low-Resource NLP",
        "Problem_Statement": "Graph neural networks and large foundation models evolve largely in silos, resulting in poor integration that limits leveraging graph-based structure with zero-shot cross-lingual capabilities in low-resource language tasks.",
        "Motivation": "This addresses the integration gap identified as a lack of bridge nodes between prompt tuning and graph-based paradigms (an internal gap), and the external gap of unexploited fusion of semantic knowledge, zero-shot learning, and graph representations for enhanced low-resource NLP, corresponding to Opportunity 2.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid Graph-FM (Foundation Model) Zero-Shot Fusion architecture where graph neural networks encode structural and semantic relations from low-resource language data, and their embeddings are explicitly injected into a foundation model’s attention mechanism to augment its zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning. The system employs a novel graph-to-prompt converter that transforms graph embeddings into dynamic prompts that guide the FM's predictions. This approach grounds the FM’s knowledge with explicit graph representations, enabling better generalization and robustness in low-resource NLP tasks such as stance and misinformation detection.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Obtain multilingual datasets with annotated graphs (e.g., semantic dependency graphs, knowledge bases) from languages like Hausa, Welsh. 2) Pretrain GNNs to capture structural semantic information. 3) Design a graph-to-dynamic prompt module to interface GNN outputs with FM attention layers. 4) Fine-tune cross-lingual foundation models (e.g., XLM-R) with the fused graph prompts under zero-shot and few-shot settings. 5) Compare with models without graph fusion and traditional prompt tuning. 6) Evaluate on benchmarks like XNLI, cross-lingual stance detection with metrics including accuracy and generalization under scarce training data.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Stance detection text in a low-resource language with accompanying graph indicating user relations and semantic concepts. Expected: Model predicts stance correctly with improved zero-shot transfer due to graph prompting compared to FM baseline.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct graph prompting is ineffective, explore late fusion where GNN outputs and FM predictions are combined via ensemble methods. Alternatively, pretrain FMs on graph-augmented corpora or utilize contrastive learning to better align graph and text embeddings."

        "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource language models require interpretable and data-efficient frameworks that combine reasoning and learning, yet current approaches lack explainability and robust decision-making tailored to few-shot/zero-shot scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "This proposal targets the gap of lack of interpretable, robust models for low-resource contexts and leverages Opportunity 3 by integrating explainable logic-based reasoning modules with adversarial semi/self-supervised learning under few-shot and zero-shot paradigms.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose LogicSSL, a framework combining an explainable logic reasoning module inspired by FOLAR with an adversarial semi/self-supervised learning pipeline. The logic module encodes domain-agnostic inference rules derived from linguistic and semantic constraints, aiding interpretability. The adversarial component generates challenging unlabeled samples to enhance model robustness. The system learns jointly on scarce labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, guided by logic constraints to improve generalization in low-resource languages.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect low-resource language datasets with limited annotations. 2) Define domain-relevant logical rules reflecting grammar, semantics, and task-specific constraints. 3) Implement an adversarial semi-supervised learning mechanism that generates hard examples. 4) Jointly train model to satisfy logic constraints and minimize adversarial losses. 5) Evaluate on tasks including stance detection and misinformation classification. 6) Assess interpretability via logic-based explanations and standard performance metrics like F1, robustness to label noise.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A few annotated examples of misinformation claims in Xitsonga plus unlabeled text corpus. Expected output: Accurate misinformation classification with explanations grounded in logical inference rules, demonstrating improved data efficiency compared to non-logical baselines.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If adversarial training destabilizes learning, adopt curriculum learning with gradual difficulty increase. If logic rules are too rigid, implement soft logic with probabilistic constraints or use rule induction for automatic expansions."

        "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap on combining structured semantic knowledge and zero-shot/few-shot learning to mitigate data scarcity by proposing a knowledge distillation framework from graph-enhanced large language models to lightweight student models for ultra low-resource languages.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We design a two-stage knowledge distillation process where a teacher model enriched with graph neural network embeddings guides a smaller student model specialized for an unseen ultra low-resource language. The teacher uses joint graph and language model attention to produce semantic-rich outputs, which are distilled via soft targets and intermediate representation alignment. This enables the student model to inherit both deep semantic reasoning and cross-lingual zero-shot capabilities without requiring annotated data.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Train teacher model with graph encoders and foundation language models on high-resource languages. 2) Select ultra low-resource languages with minimal or no labels. 3) Distill knowledge to student model using unlabeled data and pseudo-labeling. 4) Measure performance on downstream tasks like stance and misinformation detection. 5) Baseline against direct fine-tuning and multilingual pretraining. 6) Metrics: accuracy, model size, inference speed, sample efficiency.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A text snippet in a rare language (e.g., Hiri Motu) needing stance classification. Expected output: Student model accurately classifies stance with performance close to teacher, despite the absence of annotated data in the target language.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If distillation fails, integrate unsupervised pretraining steps on target language data or use multilingual adapters to inject language-specific capacity. Alternatively, augment data with synthetic samples generated by multilingual LLMs."

        "Problem_Statement": "Existing prompt tuning techniques for low-resource languages rely on generic tokens and function separately across tasks, leading to scalability and transfer limitations.",
        "Motivation": "Responds directly to the internal gaps about random tokens lacking semantic meaning and siloed prompt tuning by introducing a unified prompt tuning approach leveraging semantic graph tokens shared across multiple NLP tasks for better data efficiency and transfer.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose Unified Semantic Graph Token (USGT) prompt tuning where a shared vocabulary of linguistically meaningful tokens derived from semantic graphs is used as prompt embeddings across multiple tasks (e.g., stance detection, misinformation classification). These tokens capture universal semantic concepts in the target low-resource languages. The USGT module is dynamically composed per task and fed into a foundation model via a prompt tuning interface, enabling multi-task learning with a common interpretable semantic foundation able to transfer knowledge between tasks efficiently.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build semantic graphs from corpora in low-resource languages. 2) Extract universal semantic tokens and create a token vocabulary. 3) Implement USGT prompt tuning replacing random tokens in prompts. 4) Train on multiple low-resource NLP tasks jointly with limited annotated data. 5) Compare with task-specific prompt tuning and zero-shot baselines. 6) Evaluate transfer learning ability, accuracy, and robustness metrics across tasks.",

        "Motivation": "Addresses internal limitations in tuning tokens and the external need for robustness in few-shot learning by developing an adversarial semantic token generator that creates meaningful challenging tokens to improve model robustness and semantic understanding, linking Opportunity 1 and 3.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a token generation adversarial network that learns to produce semantically meaningful tuning tokens that maximize model error during few-shot training. These adversarial semantic tokens augment standard prompt tuning tokens to expose model vulnerabilities and improve robustness. The generator leverages multilingual semantic embeddings and graph-based token constraints to ensure linguistic validity. The model is fine-tuned using both clean and adversarial semantic tokens in a curriculum learning manner for improved generalization.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Train token adversarial network conditioned on semantic graphs of low-resource languages. 2) Augment prompt tuning tokens during few-shot training with generated adversarial semantic tokens. 3) Evaluate robustness on downstream tasks under adversarial input perturbations and domain generalization. 4) Compare against standard prompt tuning and random adversarial token baselines. 5) Use metrics like accuracy, F1, calibration error under clean and adversarial scenarios.",

        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a Graph-Augmented Contrastive Alignment (GACA) framework that jointly learns language-agnostic semantic representations by contrasting graph-based semantic embeddings with textual embeddings from foundation models. The model minimizes distance between semantically equivalent graph-text pairs across languages, enabling zero-shot cross-domain transfer. This method exploits unlabeled cross-lingual corpora and semantic graphs to form positive pairs with negative sampling, facilitating robust semantic alignment in low-resource contexts.",
