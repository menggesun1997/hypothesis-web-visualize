    "Problem_Statement": "Large language models are too computationally and memory intensive for direct deployment on IoT edge devices. Existing CNN-transformer hybrids are underutilized for efficient model compression and adaptation specifically tailored to analog in-memory computing hardware constraints, limiting real-time NLP application feasibility.",
    "Motivation": "This project addresses the internal gap concerning underexploited CNN roles as a bridge for compression and adaptation in transformer models for resource-limited IoT NLP tasks, linking it to the innovation opportunity of hybrid CNN-transformer architectures optimized for analog computing.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a hybrid architecture where CNN modules extract localized syntactic features efficiently on analog in-memory crossbar arrays, feeding into lightweight transformer blocks optimized for global semantic context. Implement novel analog-friendly transformer attention approximations reducing costly multiply-accumulate operations. Introduce model compression techniques leveraging CNN feature map sparsity and quantization adapted for memristor-based analog computing to minimize latency and energy usage in NLP tasks like keyword spotting and text classification on IoT devices.",

        "title": "Analog-Aware CNN-Transformer Fusion with Neural Architecture Search for Ultra-Low-Power Edge NLP on Memristive Hardware",
        "Problem_Statement": "The deployment of large language models on resource-constrained IoT edge devices remains infeasible due to immense computational and memory demands. While CNN-transformer hybrid architectures hold promise for NLP tasks, their adaptation and compression tailored specifically for analog in-memory memristor-based hardware lack detailed exploration. Furthermore, existing transformer attention mechanisms are multiply-accumulate intensive, posing challenges in analog implementations. There is a critical need for an end-to-end, analog-aware hybrid model design that incorporates automated architecture optimization and novel low-cost attention approximations to enable real-time, energy-efficient NLP tasks on ultra-low-power IoT edge devices.",
        "Motivation": "Current solutions inadequately leverage the synergies of CNN and transformer architectures optimized for analog in-memory computing, particularly in the context of resource-constrained edge NLP applications. The novelty-competitive landscape demands a differentiated approach that explicitly designs and validates analog-friendly attention mechanisms, integrates neural architecture search (NAS) for automated compression and feature extractor tuning, and extends applicability through privacy-conscious federated learning frameworks. This project endeavors to bridge this gap by combining hardware-aware model design with state-of-the-art learning algorithms and system-level integration, thereby advancing the frontier of efficient edge NLP processing on memristor platforms.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-faceted hybrid approach with three core innovations: 1) Design of an analog-friendly attention approximation that replaces costly multiply-accumulate operations with low-complexity analog-compatible primitives (e.g., piecewise linear functions and sign-based key-query operations) to drastically reduce computation overhead on memristor crossbars. 2) Careful dataflow and hardware-aware co-design clarifying how CNN modules extract localized syntactic features using analog crossbar arrays and pass compressed feature maps to lightweight transformer blocks implementing the proposed attention variant, minimizing data movement and leveraging memristor noise resilience. We provide detailed algorithmic formulations, block diagrams of the dataflow architecture, and preliminary simulation of latency and energy trade-offs. 3) Integration of neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms specialized for hardware constraints to automatically find optimal CNN-transformer layer configurations, sparsity patterns, and quantization schemes that maximize compression and energy efficiency without compromising NLP task accuracy. Additionally, we incorporate federated learning protocols to enable privacy-preserving, on-device personalization, further enhancing practical applicability. The unified method is targeted at real-time NLP tasks such as keyword spotting and intent classification with direct deployment on memristor-based analog accelerators.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset Selection: Employ edge NLP benchmark datasets like SpeechCommands (keyword spotting) and SNIPS (intent classification). 2. Model Implementation: Develop baseline transformer, baseline CNN-transformer hybrid, analog-optimized hybrid with proposed attention and NAS-tuned architectures. 3. Hardware Simulation: Build detailed memristor-based analog crossbar simulations to evaluate latency, energy, noise tolerance, and operation precision of analog-friendly attention and CNN operations. 4. Optimization: Apply NAS for hybrid model compression, feature extraction tuning, and quantization adapted for analog hardware constraints. 5. Federated Learning Setup: Implement simulated federated learning experiments for on-device adaptation and privacy assessment. 6. Metrics and Ablation: Measure accuracy, inference latency, energy consumption, compression ratio, and throughput; conduct ablation to evaluate the impact of attention approximation, NAS tuning, and federated learning on performance. 7. Validation: Compare against digital low-precision accelerator baselines and state-of-the-art techniques to demonstrate competitive edges in energy and latency.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Audio command \"Set alarm for 7 am\" captured by an IoT voice assistant device. Expected output: Intent classification accuracy at or above 85%, inference latency below 50 ms, and energy consumption under 10 mJ per inference, enabling prolonged battery life. Additional test: On-device personalized adaptation via federated learning on new speaker data without cloud transmission, maintaining accuracy within 5% of centralized training.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If analog hardware simulation reveals stability issues with the attention approximation, we will iteratively refine algorithmic approximations or revert to hybrid analog-digital schemes preserving low-power benefits. Should NAS optimization not yield sufficient compression-accuracy trade-offs, we will explore complementary techniques such as knowledge distillation guided by CNN-derived sparsity patterns. In case federated learning introduces unacceptable overhead, a streamlined TinyML-inspired on-device fine-tuning approach will be employed to retain privacy benefits with reduced complexity."
