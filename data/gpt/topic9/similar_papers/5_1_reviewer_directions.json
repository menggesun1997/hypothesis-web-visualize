    "title": "Federated Multi-modal Privacy-preserving Bias Mitigation System",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current social media text analysis models inadequately protect user privacy and suffer from sampling bias due to centralized data aggregation, undermining fairness and data ownership respect.",
    "Motivation": "This tackles the internal gap in privacy protection and sampling bias by synthesizing federated learning, multi-modal data fusion, and privacy-aware large language model architectures, an underexplored intersection per the research map's highlighted gaps.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a federated learning system where social media clients collaboratively train a multi-modal biased content detection model combining text and image context embeddings via privacy-preserving mechanisms (e.g., differential privacy, secure aggregation). Embed privacy constraints directly into LLM prompt tuning for bias mitigation. The approach respetcs decentralized data ownership and reduces sampling bias by incorporating diverse local datasets without centralized raw data collection.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multi-modal social media datasets with text-image pairs (e.g., Twitter, Instagram). 2. Simulate federated setting with distributed client partitions. 3. Implement privacy-preserving federated training with differential privacy budgets. 4. Compare with centralized and non-privacy-aware baselines. 5. Evaluate bias mitigation effectiveness, privacy leakage (membership inference attacks), and fairness metrics across demographic groups.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input from client device: textual post with embedded image potentially containing racial stereotypes. Model outputs: bias label and explanation locally while no raw data leaves the client, contributing only encrypted model updates to server aggregation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated training convergence issues arise, implement hybrid federated-centralized training or reduce model complexity. Alternatively, rely on local debiasing pre-processing pipelines when full federated privacy guarantees are infeasible."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed experiment plan lacks clarity and depth regarding the federated training implementation details and the handling of multi-modal fusion at the client side. Specifically, simulating client partitions with sufficiently realistic heterogeneity and privacy budget impacts is non-trivial and should be more rigorously outlined. It is advisable to elaborate on how differential privacy budgets will be balanced with model utility, what privacy accounting methods will be used, and how convergence challenges will be monitored and mitigated. Further, evaluation metrics for bias mitigation and fairness should be explicitly tied to measurable criteria relevant to both text and image modalities. Incorporating standardized benchmarks or existing multi-modal social media datasets would strengthen feasibility assessment and reproducibility prospects. Overall, a more detailed, justified, and staged experimental methodology is critical for practical feasibility and validation of the system's claims, especially given the complexity of privacy-preserving federated multi-modal learning setups.\n\nRecommendation: Expand the Experiment_Plan with technical details on federated simulation setup, privacy budget management, multi-modal fusion strategies, convergence criteria, and evaluation metrics with references to relevant datasets or benchmarks to ensure scientific rigor and execution feasibility at scale within realistic resource constraints.\n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "Given the 'NOV-COMPETITIVE' novelty score and the underexplored intersection of federated privacy-aware bias mitigation in multi-modal social media contexts, the proposal can significantly enhance novelty and impact by integrating related advances from medical AI and vision-language modeling. For instance, adopting federated multi-modal privacy techniques proven in sensitive healthcare imaging datasets (e.g., multi-dimensional medical images from IoMT devices) could provide robust privacy-preserving architectures and evaluation frameworks. Leveraging state-of-the-art generative AI methods for prompt tuning of large language models might help in refining bias mitigation strategies with richer contextual understanding. Additionally, incorporating cybersecurity measures tailored to federated settings could address emerging attack vectors in decentralized training. This global integration would broaden the system's applicability beyond social media, enhancing both its scientific novelty and societal impact while differentiating it from existing competitive works.\n\nRecommendation: Explore adaptation and cross-domain transfer of federated multi-modal privacy solutions and bias mitigation methods from healthcare AI and vision-language research, and incorporate cybersecurity best practices for federated systems to heighten novelty and broaden potential impact.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
