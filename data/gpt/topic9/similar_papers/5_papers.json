    "abstract": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have raised concerns about the ethical, moral, and legal safeguards. There is a pressing need to improve metrics for assessing security and privacy of AI systems and to manage AI technology in a more ethical manner. To address these challenges, an AI Trust Framework and Maturity Model is proposed to enhance trust in the design and management of AI systems. Trust in AI involves an agreed-upon understanding between humans and machines about system performance. The framework utilizes an \"entropy lens\" to root the study in information theory and enhance transparency and trust in \"black box\" AI systems, which lack ethical guardrails. High entropy in AI systems can decrease human trust, particularly in uncertain and competitive environments. The research draws inspiration from entropy studies to improve trust and performance in autonomous human-machine teams and systems, including interconnected elements in hierarchical systems. Applying this lens to improve trust in AI also highlights new opportunities to optimize performance in teams. Two use cases are described to validate the AI framework's ability to measure trust in the design and management of AI systems.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: To examine the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) and assess its impact on medical imaging, diagnostic workflows, and patient outcomes. This review explores the technological evolution, key advancements, and challenges associated with AI-enhanced PACS in healthcare settings.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, covering articles from January 2000 to October 2024. Search terms included \"artificial intelligence,\" \"machine learning,\" \"deep learning,\" and \"PACS,\" combined with keywords related to diagnostic accuracy and workflow optimization. Articles were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, focusing on peerreviewed studies that discussed AI applications in PACS, innovations in medical imaging, and workflow improvements. A total of 183 studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising original research, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses.\nRESULTS: AI integration in PACS has significantly enhanced diagnostic accuracy, achieving improvements of up to 93.2% in some imaging modalities, such as early tumor detection and anomaly identification. Workflow efficiency has been transformed, with diagnostic times reduced by up to 90% for critical conditions like intracranial hemorrhages. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in image segmentation, achieving up to 94% accuracy, and in motion artifact correction, further enhancing diagnostic precision. Natural language processing (NLP) tools have expedited radiology workflows, reducing reporting times by 30-50% and improving consistency in report generation. Cloudbased solutions have also improved accessibility, enabling real-time collaboration and remote diagnostics. However, challenges in data privacy, regulatory compliance, and interoperability persist, emphasizing the need for standardized frameworks and robust security protocols. Conclusions The integration of AI into PACS represents a pivotal transformation in medical imaging, offering improved diagnostic workflows and potential for personalized patient care. Addressing existing challenges and enhancing interoperability will be essential for maximizing the benefits of AIpowered PACS in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Critical National Infrastructures (CNIs)-including energy grids, water systems, transportation networks, and communication frameworks-are essential to modern society yet face escalating cybersecurity threats. This review paper comprehensively analyzes AI-driven approaches for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP). We begin by examining the reliability of CNIs and introduce established benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) within cybersecurity contexts. Next, we explore core cybersecurity issues, focusing on trust, privacy, resilience, and securability in these vital systems. Building on this foundation, we assess the role of Generative AI and LLMs in enhancing CIP and present insights on applying Agentic AI for proactive defense mechanisms. Finally, we outline future directions to guide the integration of advanced AI methodologies into protecting critical infrastructures. Our paper provides a strategic roadmap for researchers and practitioners committed to fortifying national infrastructures against emerging cyber threats through this synthesis of current challenges, benchmarking strategies, and innovative AI applications.",

    "abstract": "Our interdisciplinary study examines the effectiveness of US law in addressing the complex challenges posed by generative AI systems to fundamental human values, including physical and mental well-being, privacy, autonomy, diversity, and equity. Through the analysis of diverse hypothetical scenarios developed in collaboration with experts, we identified significant shortcomings and ambiguities within the existing legal protections. Constitutional and civil rights law currently struggles to hold AI companies responsible for AI-assisted discriminatory outputs. Moreover, even without considering the liability shield provided by Section 230, existing liability laws may not effectively remedy unintentional and intangible harms caused by AI systems. Demonstrating causal links for liability claims such as defamation or product liability proves exceptionally difficult due to the intricate and opaque nature of these systems. To effectively address these unique and evolving risks posed by generative AI, we propose a “Responsible AI Legal Framework”  that adapts to recognize new threats and utilizes a multi-pronged approach. This framework would enshrine fundamental values in legal frameworks, establish comprehensive safety guidelines, and implement liability models tailored to the complexities of human-AI interactions. By proactively mitigating unforeseen harms like mental health impacts and privacy breaches, this framework aims to create a legal landscape capable of navigating the exciting yet precarious future brought forth by generative AI technologies.",

    "abstract": "This review explores the role of prompt engineering in unleashing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Prompt engineering is the process of structuring inputs, and it has emerged as a crucial technique for maximizing the utility and accuracy of these models. Both foundational and advanced prompt engineering methodologies-including techniques such as self-consistency, chain of thought, and generated knowledge, which can significantly enhance the performance of models-are explored in this paper. Additionally, the prompt methods for vision language models (VLMs) are examined in detail. Prompt methods are evaluated with subjective and objective metrics, ensuring a robust analysis of their efficacy. Critical to this discussion is the role of prompt engineering in artificial intelligence (AI) security, particularly in terms of defending against adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs. Strategies for minimizing these risks and improving the robustness of models are thoroughly reviewed. Finally, we provide a perspective for future research and applications.",

    "abstract": "Greater than 650 million individuals worldwide are categorized as obese, which is associated with significant health, economic, and social challenges. Given its overlap with leading comorbidities such as heart disease, innovative solutions are necessary to improve risk prediction and management strategies. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as powerful tools in healthcare, offering novel approaches to chronic disease prevention. This narrative review explores the role of AI/ML in obesity risk prediction and management, with a special focus on childhood obesity. We begin by examining the multifactorial nature of obesity, including genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors, and the limitations of traditional approaches to predict and treat morbidity associated obesity. Next, we analyze AI/ML techniques commonly used to predict obesity risk, particularly in minimizing childhood obesity risk. We shift to the application of AI/ML in obesity management, comparing perspectives from healthcare providers versus patients. From the provider's perspective, AI/ML tools offer real-time data from electronic medical records, wearables, and health apps to stratify patient risk, customize treatment plans, and enhance clinical decision making. From the patient's perspective, AI/ML-driven interventions offer personalized coaching and improve long-term engagement in health management. Finally, we address key limitations and challenges, such as the role of social determinants of health, in embracing the role of AI/ML in obesity management, while offering our recommendations based on our literature review.",

    "abstract": "Environmental health (EH) is a complex and interdisciplinary field dedicated to the examination of environmental behaviours, toxicological effects, health risks, and strategies for mitigating harmful environmental factors. Traditional EH research investigates correlations between risk factors and health outcomes through control variables, but this route is difficult to address complex EH issue. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology not only has accelerated the innovation of the scientific research paradigm but also has become an important tool for solving complex EH problems. However, the in-depth and comprehensive implementation of AI in the field of EH still faces many barriers, such as model generalizability, data privacy protection, algorithm transparency, and regulatory and ethical issues. This review focuses on the compound exposures of EH and explores the potential, challenges, and development directions of AI in four key phases of EH research: (1) data collection, fusion, and management, (2) hazard identification and screening, (3) risk modeling and assessment and (4) EH management. It is not difficult to see that in the future, artificial intelligence technology will inevitably carry out multidimensional simulation of complex exposure factors through multi-mode data fusion, so as to achieve accurate identification of environmental health risks, and eventually become an efficient tool for global environmental health management. This review will help researchers re-examine this strategy and provide a reference for AI to solve complex exposure problems.",

    "abstract": "In the domain of using DL-based methods in medical and healthcare prediction systems, the utilization of state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) methodologies assumes paramount significance. DL has attained remarkable achievements across diverse domains, rendering its efficacy particularly noteworthy in this context. The integration of DL with health and medical prediction systems enables real-time analysis of vast and intricate datasets, yielding insights that significantly enhance healthcare outcomes and operational efficiency in the industry. This comprehensive literature review systematically investigates the latest DL solutions for the challenges encountered in medical healthcare, with a specific emphasis on DL applications in the medical domain. By categorizing cutting-edge DL approaches into distinct categories, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), long short-term memory (LSTM) models, support vector machine (SVM), and hybrid models, this study delves into their underlying principles, merits, limitations, methodologies, simulation environments, and datasets. Notably, the majority of the scrutinized articles were published in 2022, underscoring the contemporaneous nature of the research. Moreover, this review accentuates the forefront advancements in DL techniques and their practical applications within the realm of medical prediction systems, while simultaneously addressing the challenges that hinder the widespread implementation of DL in image segmentation within the medical healthcare domains. These discerned insights serve as compelling impetuses for future studies aimed at the progressive advancement of using DL-based methods in medical and health prediction systems. The evaluation metrics employed across the reviewed articles encompass a broad spectrum of features, encompassing accuracy, precision, specificity, F-score, adoptability, adaptability, and scalability.",

    "abstract": "Social data in digital form-including user-generated content, expressed or implicit relations between people, and behavioral traces-are at the core of popular applications and platforms, driving the research agenda of many researchers. The promises of social data are many, including understanding \"what the world thinks\" about a social issue, brand, celebrity, or other entity, as well as enabling better decision-making in a variety of fields including public policy, healthcare, and economics. Many academics and practitioners have warned against the naïve usage of social data. There are biases and inaccuracies occurring at the source of the data, but also introduced during processing. There are methodological limitations and pitfalls, as well as ethical boundaries and unexpected consequences that are often overlooked. This paper recognizes the rigor with which these issues are addressed by different researchers varies across a wide range. We identify a variety of menaces in the practices around social data use, and organize them in a framework that helps to identify them. \"<i>For your own sanity, you have to remember that not all problems can be solved. Not all problems can be solved, but all problems can be illuminated.\" -Ursula Franklin</i>.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) herald transformative potentials for reshaping glaucoma clinical management, improving screening efficacy, sharpening diagnosis precision, and refining the detection of disease progression. However, incorporating AI into healthcare usages faces significant hurdles in terms of developing algorithms and putting them into practice. When creating algorithms, issues arise due to the intensive effort required to label data, inconsistent diagnostic standards, and a lack of thorough testing, which often limits the algorithms' widespread applicability. Additionally, the \"black box\" nature of AI algorithms may cause doctors to be wary or skeptical. When it comes to using these tools, challenges include dealing with lower-quality images in real situations and the systems' limited ability to work well with diverse ethnic groups and different diagnostic equipment. Looking ahead, new developments aim to protect data privacy through federated learning paradigms, improving algorithm generalizability by diversifying input data modalities, and augmenting datasets with synthetic imagery. The integration of smartphones appears promising for using AI algorithms in both clinical and non-clinical settings. Furthermore, bringing in large language models (LLMs) to act as interactive tool in medicine may signify a significant change in how healthcare will be delivered in the future. By navigating through these challenges and leveraging on these as opportunities, the field of glaucoma AI will not only have improved algorithmic accuracy and optimized data integration but also a paradigmatic shift towards enhanced clinical acceptance and a transformative improvement in glaucoma care.",
