    "title": "Explainable Logic-Augmented Semi-Supervised Learning for Low-Resource Languages",
    "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource language models require interpretable and data-efficient frameworks that combine reasoning and learning, yet current approaches lack explainability and robust decision-making tailored to few-shot/zero-shot scenarios.",
    "Motivation": "This proposal targets the gap of lack of interpretable, robust models for low-resource contexts and leverages Opportunity 3 by integrating explainable logic-based reasoning modules with adversarial semi/self-supervised learning under few-shot and zero-shot paradigms.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose LogicSSL, a framework combining an explainable logic reasoning module inspired by FOLAR with an adversarial semi/self-supervised learning pipeline. The logic module encodes domain-agnostic inference rules derived from linguistic and semantic constraints, aiding interpretability. The adversarial component generates challenging unlabeled samples to enhance model robustness. The system learns jointly on scarce labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, guided by logic constraints to improve generalization in low-resource languages.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect low-resource language datasets with limited annotations. 2) Define domain-relevant logical rules reflecting grammar, semantics, and task-specific constraints. 3) Implement an adversarial semi-supervised learning mechanism that generates hard examples. 4) Jointly train model to satisfy logic constraints and minimize adversarial losses. 5) Evaluate on tasks including stance detection and misinformation classification. 6) Assess interpretability via logic-based explanations and standard performance metrics like F1, robustness to label noise.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A few annotated examples of misinformation claims in Xitsonga plus unlabeled text corpus. Expected output: Accurate misinformation classification with explanations grounded in logical inference rules, demonstrating improved data efficiency compared to non-logical baselines.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adversarial training destabilizes learning, adopt curriculum learning with gradual difficulty increase. If logic rules are too rigid, implement soft logic with probabilistic constraints or use rule induction for automatic expansions."

        "title": "Explainable Logic-Augmented Semi-Supervised Learning with Knowledge Injection for Low-Resource Languages",
        "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource language models suffer from limited annotated data and often lack robust, interpretable frameworks that effectively combine symbolic reasoning and learning. Current state-of-the-art approaches struggle to integrate explainable logic-based reasoning with adversarial semi/self-supervised learning, particularly under few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, due to unclear mechanisms for harmonizing symbolic constraints with differentiable learning objectives. Moreover, leveraging pretrained multilingual representations and knowledge injection remains underexplored in this context.",
        "Motivation": "While semi-supervised and adversarial learning methods have boosted performance on NLP tasks, their black-box nature and instability in low-resource languages limit practical impact. Our proposal advances beyond current competitive methods by explicitly integrating symbolic logic reasoning with adversarial self-supervised learning through a novel, technically grounded mechanism that harmonizes these signals. Additionally, we incorporate pretrained multilingual transformer embeddings and symbolic knowledge bases as injected knowledge sources, enhancing data efficiency, learning stability, and interpretability. This combination addresses key gaps in explainability and robustness, advances the frontier of explainable AI for low-resource NLP, and extends applicability to misinformation and biomedical domains where annotation cost is prohibitive.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose LogicSSL+, an explainable semi/self-supervised learning framework that integrates: (1) a logic reasoning module encoding domain-agnostic and language-specific inference rules via differentiable fuzzy logic layers enforcing constraints as soft differentiable losses; (2) adversarial semi/self-supervised learning that generates informative unlabeled examples to robustify the model; and (3) knowledge injection from pretrained multilingual transformers (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R) and symbolic knowledge bases (e.g., lexical ontologies), jointly embedded to capture long-range dependencies and semantic priors. The framework uses a unified multi-objective optimization that balances: (i) supervised loss on scarce labeled data, (ii) adversarial consistency losses on unlabeled data, and (iii) logic constraint satisfaction implemented through differentiable relaxation of logical formulas. Conflicts between adversarial objectives and logic constraints are resolved via a scheduled weighting scheme guided by training dynamics and validated with a teacher-student curriculum learning paradigm to ensure stable convergence and prevent collapse. An abductive reasoning-inspired module further refines explanations by selecting minimal logic premises supporting predictions, improving interpretability. This integration is architected as a modular pipeline, combining pretrained embeddings, fuzzy logic layers, adversarial sequence generators, and curriculum training components, making it practically feasible and scientifically rigorous.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect benchmark datasets of low-resource languages (e.g., Xitsonga, Wolof) with limited labeled annotations and large unlabeled corpora, including misinformation and biomedical text sources. 2) Curate and encode domain-relevant logical rules reflecting linguistic grammar, semantic constraints, and task-specific domain knowledge, converting them into differentiable fuzzy logic constraints compatible with neural training. 3) Integrate pretrained multilingual transformer embeddings as input features and fuse symbolic knowledge bases via embedding augmentation. 4) Implement an adversarial semi/self-supervised learner that dynamically generates challenging examples for robust representation learning. 5) Develop a multi-objective training pipeline with adaptive loss weighting and a teacher-student curriculum to harmonize logic satisfaction and adversarial learning signals. 6) Evaluate on downstream NLP tasks (e.g., stance detection, misinformation classification, biomedical entity recognition) under few-shot and zero-shot setups, assessing F1-score, robustness to adversarial and label noise, and interpretability via logic-based explanations and abductive premises. 7) Conduct ablation studies to quantify contributions of each component, including knowledge injection and curriculum learning strategies.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Few labeled misinformation claims and unlabeled corpora in Xitsonga and Wolof, enriched with domain-specific inference rules on misinformation semantics and lexical constraints, plus pretrained multilingual embeddings and symbolic knowledge base integration. Expected output: Accurate misinformation classification in zero-shot and few-shot settings with explanations articulating logic-based reasoning chains derived from fuzzy logic rules and abductive premises, illustrating superior data efficiency, robustness, and interpretability over baselines without knowledge injection or logic constraints.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If adversarial training remains unstable despite curriculum learning, we will replace it with a self-training loop with confidence-thresholded pseudo-labeling combined with logic-based consistency regularization. If fuzzy logic constraints prove too rigid or degrade performance, we will incorporate probabilistic soft logic with learnable weights at rule level and explore automated rule induction techniques to expand or revise the symbolic knowledge base dynamically. In the event pretrained embeddings fail to transfer effectively, a lightweight domain-adaptation head or intermediate fine-tuning will be applied. These fallback strategies ensure robust, scalable learning while preserving interpretability and data-efficiency objectives."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed logic reasoning module inspired by FOLAR is a promising direction for explainability, but the method description lacks clarity on how logic constraints are integrated technically with adversarial semi/self-supervised learning in a joint training framework. Specifically, details on the interface between symbolic logic and differentiable learning components, the optimization objectives, and how conflicts between adversarial losses and logic constraints are resolved are needed to assess soundness fully. Explicit architectural or algorithmic sketches would improve confidence in the mechanism's feasibility and interpretability claims, preventing unrealistic assumptions of seamless integration of symbolic reasoning with adversarial sample generation and semi-supervised updates, which is known to be challenging in NLP contexts, especially under low-resource regimes. Addressing this gap would strengthen the internal coherence of the method and guide experimental implementation choices effectively. This is critical because weak or unclear integration may impede learning stability or interpretability, reducing the proposed approach's practical utility and scientific contribution relevance in explainable low-resource NLP modeling.  Suggest elaborating on: (1) how logic rules are encoded and enforced during parameter updates, (2) the interaction between logic satisfaction and adversarial objectives, and (3) mechanisms to balance competing signals to avoid model collapse or explanation inconsistency during training."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment indicates the idea is competitive but not clearly state-of-the-art, consider enhancing the framework's innovation and impact by integrating recent advances from global concepts such as 'knowledge injection' and 'transfer learning.' Specifically, incorporating pretrained multilingual or cross-lingual transformer models with symbolic knowledge bases or abductive reasoning frameworks could reinforce LogicSSL's reasoning capabilities and data efficiency. For example, use pretrained contextual embeddings or vision-language multimodal features as input to the logic module to model long-range dependencies while maintaining explainability. Additionally, leveraging teacher-student or curriculum learning paradigms mentioned can stabilize adversarial training and extend applicability beyond pure NLP tasks to biomedical or misinformation contexts. These integrations can improve robustness, widen the applicability spectrum, and address cost and scarcity of annotations effectively, thereby shifting the work towards the 'next generation of AI' approaches. Highlighting such linkages and technical paths in the proposal would position the research more competitively within the dynamic and crowded landscape of explainable semi-supervised learning for low-resource languages."
