    "abstract": "Biomedical research and clinical practice are in the midst of a transition toward significantly increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods. These advances promise to enable qualitatively deeper insight into complex challenges formerly beyond the reach of analytic methods and human intuition while placing increased demands on ethical and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), given the opaque nature of many deep learning methods. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) has initiated a significant research and development program, Bridge2AI, aimed at producing new \"flagship\" datasets designed to support AI/ML analysis of complex biomedical challenges, elucidate best practices, develop tools and standards in AI/ML data science, and disseminate these datasets, tools, and methods broadly to the biomedical community. An essential set of concepts to be developed and disseminated in this program along with the data and tools produced are criteria for AI-readiness of data, including critical considerations for XAI and ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of AI technologies. NIH Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) Standards Working Group members prepared this article to present methods for assessing the AI-readiness of biomedical data and the data standards perspectives and criteria we have developed throughout this program. While the field is rapidly evolving, these criteria are foundational for scientific rigor and the ethical design and application of biomedical AI methods.",

    "abstract": "The increasing human population and variable weather conditions, due to climate change, pose a threat to the world's food security. To improve global food security, we need to provide breeders with tools to develop crop cultivars that are more resilient to extreme weather conditions and provide growers with tools to more effectively manage biotic and abiotic stresses in their crops. Plant phenotyping, the measurement of a plant's structural and functional characteristics, has the potential to inform, improve and accelerate both breeders' selections and growers' management decisions. To improve the speed, reliability and scale of plant phenotyping procedures, many researchers have adopted deep learning methods to estimate phenotypic information from images of plants and crops. Despite the successful results of these image-based phenotyping studies, the representations learned by deep learning models remain difficult to interpret, understand, and explain. For this reason, deep learning models are still considered to be black boxes. Explainable AI (XAI) is a promising approach for opening the deep learning model's black box and providing plant scientists with image-based phenotypic information that is interpretable and trustworthy. Although various fields of study have adopted XAI to advance their understanding of deep learning models, it has yet to be well-studied in the context of plant phenotyping research. In this review article, we reviewed existing XAI studies in plant shoot phenotyping, as well as related domains, to help plant researchers understand the benefits of XAI and make it easier for them to integrate XAI into their future studies. An elucidation of the representations within a deep learning model can help researchers explain the model's decisions, relate the features detected by the model to the underlying plant physiology, and enhance the trustworthiness of image-based phenotypic information used in food production systems.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently being utilized in a wide range of sophisticated applications, but the outcomes of many AI models are challenging to comprehend and trust due to their black-box nature. Usually, it is essential to understand the reasoning behind an AI model’s decision-making. Thus, the need for eXplainable AI (XAI) methods for improving trust in AI models has arisen. XAI has become a popular research subject within the AI field in recent years. Existing survey papers have tackled the concepts of XAI, its general terms, and post-hoc explainability methods but there have not been any reviews that have looked at the assessment methods, available tools, XAI datasets, and other related aspects. Therefore, in this comprehensive study, we provide readers with an overview of the current research and trends in this rapidly emerging area with a case study example. The study starts by explaining the background of XAI, common definitions, and summarizing recently proposed techniques in XAI for supervised machine learning. The review divides XAI techniques into four axes using a hierarchical categorization system: (i) data explainability, (ii) model explainability, (iii) post-hoc explainability, and (iv) assessment of explanations. We also introduce available evaluation metrics as well as open-source packages and datasets with future research directions. Then, the significance of explainability in terms of legal demands, user viewpoints, and application orientation is outlined, termed as XAI concerns. This paper advocates for tailoring explanation content to specific user types. An examination of XAI techniques and evaluation was conducted by looking at 410 critical articles, published between January 2016 and October 2022, in reputed journals and using a wide range of research databases as a source of information. The article is aimed at XAI researchers who are interested in making their AI models more trustworthy, as well as towards researchers from other disciplines who are looking for effective XAI methods to complete tasks with confidence while communicating meaning from data.",

    "abstract": "When 5G began its commercialisation journey around 2020, the discussion on\nthe vision of 6G also surfaced. Researchers expect 6G to have higher bandwidth,\ncoverage, reliability, energy efficiency, lower latency, and an integrated\n\"human-centric\" network system powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Such a\n6G network will lead to an excessive number of automated decisions made in\nreal-time. These decisions can range widely, from network resource allocation\nto collision avoidance for self-driving cars. However, the risk of losing\ncontrol over decision-making may increase due to high-speed, data-intensive AI\ndecision-making beyond designers' and users' comprehension. The promising\nexplainable AI (XAI) methods can mitigate such risks by enhancing the\ntransparency of the black-box AI decision-making process. This paper surveys\nthe application of XAI towards the upcoming 6G age in every aspect, including\n6G technologies (e.g., intelligent radio, zero-touch network management) and 6G\nuse cases (e.g., industry 5.0). Moreover, we summarised the lessons learned\nfrom the recent attempts and outlined important research challenges in applying\nXAI for 6G in the near future.",
