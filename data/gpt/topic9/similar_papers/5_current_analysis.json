There is a pressing need to improve metrics for assessing security and privacy of AI systems and to manage AI technology in a more ethical manner. To address these challenges, an AI Trust Framework and Maturity Model is proposed to enhance trust in the design and management of AI systems. Trust in AI involves an agreed-upon understanding between humans and machines about system performance. The framework utilizes an \"entropy lens\" to root the study in information theory and enhance transparency and trust in \"black box\" AI systems, which lack ethical guardrails. High entropy in AI systems can decrease human trust, particularly in uncertain and competitive environments. The research draws inspiration from entropy studies to improve trust and performance in autonomous human-machine teams and systems, including interconnected elements in hierarchical systems. Applying this lens to improve trust in AI also highlights new opportunities to optimize performance in teams. Two use cases are described to validate the AI framework\\'s ability to measure trust in the design and management of AI systems.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Transforming Medical Imaging: The Role of Artificial Intelligence Integration in PACS for Enhanced Diagnostic Accuracy and Workflow Efficiency', 'abstract': 'INTRODUCTION: To examine the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) and assess its impact on medical imaging, diagnostic workflows, and patient outcomes.

Through the analysis of diverse hypothetical scenarios developed in collaboration with experts, we identified significant shortcomings and ambiguities within the existing legal protections. Constitutional and civil rights law currently struggles to hold AI companies responsible for AI-assisted discriminatory outputs. Moreover, even without considering the liability shield provided by Section 230, existing liability laws may not effectively remedy unintentional and intangible harms caused by AI systems. Demonstrating causal links for liability claims such as defamation or product liability proves exceptionally difficult due to the intricate and opaque nature of these systems. To effectively address these unique and evolving risks posed by generative AI, we propose a “Responsible AI Legal Framework”  that adapts to recognize new threats and utilizes a multi-pronged approach. This framework would\\xa0enshrine fundamental values in legal frameworks, establish comprehensive safety guidelines, and implement liability models tailored to the complexities of human-AI interactions.

However, incorporating AI into healthcare usages faces significant hurdles in terms of developing algorithms and putting them into practice. When creating algorithms, issues arise due to the intensive effort required to label data, inconsistent diagnostic standards, and a lack of thorough testing, which often limits the algorithms\\' widespread applicability. Additionally, the \"black box\" nature of AI algorithms may cause doctors to be wary or skeptical.
