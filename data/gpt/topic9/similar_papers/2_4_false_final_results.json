    "title": "Life Course Aware Conversational Agents for Population Health Management",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current conversational AI in healthcare rarely incorporates a person-centered life course approach, limiting holistic and ethical design for managing health trajectories over time and across populations.",
    "Motivation": "This approach addresses external gap (d) emphasizing person-centered care and life course approaches, aiming to create chatbots that support long-term population health and ethical conversation management beyond episodic interactions.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a conversational AI framework embedding life course health models that track patient health states longitudinally, dynamically adjusting counseling strategies based on age, socioeconomic data, lifestyle, and genetic risk factors. Utilize longitudinal EHR and social determinants of health data to tailor preventive care dialogues and behavioral nudges. Incorporate ethical constraints ensuring respect for autonomy, privacy, and equity via a modular ethics compliance module evaluating responses in real time.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multimodal longitudinal datasets with life course indicators and population health surveys. 2. Build multi-turn dialogue datasets reflecting life course transitions and preventive care conversations. 3. Train LLMs with added ethical modules and life course embeddings. 4. Validate performance in simulated population health management scenarios and human clinical trials measuring health outcomes, user adherence, and ethical satisfaction metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Middle-aged patient looking for lifestyle advice. System integrates family history, current health metrics, and social data to respond: \"Given your family history and recent cholesterol levels, adopting a heart-healthy diet now can significantly reduce future cardiac risk.\" Expected: Person-centered, ethically sound advice promoting preventive care across life span.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If modeling life course complexity fails due to data sparsity, start with simplified age- and risk-factor stratified modules. Alternatively, implement rule-based overlays until richer datasets become available."
