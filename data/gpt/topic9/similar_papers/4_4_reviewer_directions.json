    "title": "Adaptive CNN-Guided Quantization for Transformer NLP Models on Memristor Arrays",
    "Problem_Statement": "Transformer models for NLP require aggressive quantization to fit memristor edge hardware, but static quantization degrades model performance and robustness. CNNs are underused to guide adaptive quantization tailored to local structural features within transformer layers in edge IoT NLP contexts.",
    "Motivation": "This proposal targets underutilization of CNNs as adaptive bridges for efficient model compression in transformers from the critical gaps and aligns with innovation opportunity 2 of hybrid CNN-transformer architectures for analog computing-based compression.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive quantization framework where convolutional modules analyze intermediate transformer embeddings to identify sensitive regions requiring higher precision. Quantization levels are varied dynamically per layer or token region informed by CNN feature maps to optimize accuracy versus compression tradeoffs. The quantized transformer is mapped to memristor crossbar arrays with precision variability support. This CNN-guided quantization enables edge NLP models that maintain high performance while conforming to hardware constraints in IoT deployments.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Use NLP benchmarks for IoT settings such as SLURP, Google Speech Commands. 2. Models: Baselines include uniform quantized transformer and CNN-transformed guided quantized transformer. 3. Metrics: Model accuracy, quantization bits per weight, energy consumption, inference latency. 4. Test quantization impact per layer and per token region. 5. Simulate memristor-based inference and evaluate robustness to hardware noise.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Command \"Increase temperature\" with localized contextual tokens receiving 8-bit precision while function words assigned 4-bit. Output: Accurate command classification at 91% accuracy with 50% bit reduction and 30% energy savings relative to baseline uniform quantization.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive quantization introduces complexity hindering hardware mapping, revert to CNN-guided static quantization with clustered precision levels. Evaluate simpler sensitivity-based quantization informed by gradient norms if CNN features prove insufficient."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks sufficient clarity on how the CNN modules concretely interact with the transformer embeddings. Specifically, the mechanism by which convolutional feature maps dynamically direct per-token or per-layer quantization precision is underspecified. Details on the architecture and training regime of the CNN guidance module, integration with transformer layers, and how precision levels are selected and updated during inference need elaboration to evaluate soundness and reproducibility rigorously. Providing pseudo-code or circuit mapping illustrations would strengthen methodological transparency and support peer assessment of feasibility on memristor arrays with precision variability constraints as claimed in the motivation and problem statement sections. This clarity is fundamental to trust that adaptive quantization can effectively trade off accuracy and compression in the proposed hardware context rather than being conceptual or anecdotal only. Please address this critical mechanism detail gap as the foremost priority for soundness and confidence in the approach's robustness and implementation practicality."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and that the method combines known elements (transformers, CNNs, and memristor arrays), you should enhance novelty and impact by integrating insights from emerging concepts like co-design of software and hardware or efficiency of neural networks from the provided Globally-Linked Concepts. For example, consider incorporating resource-constrained edge deployment challenges explicitly into your adaptive quantization design, leveraging efficient accelerator designs or hardware-aware transformer optimization techniques. Moreover, exploring synergies with domain-specific benchmarks beyond classical IoT NLP datasets (perhaps extending to human activity recognition or AIoT devices) could broaden relevance and acceptance. This global integration can help differentiate your work in a crowded landscape, showcasing concrete improvements not only in accuracy and bit reduction but also energy efficiency, latency, and robustness tied directly to memristor crossbar-specific noise and variation characteristics. Such explicit cross-linking will boost your submission's competitiveness and potential acceptance at premier venues."
