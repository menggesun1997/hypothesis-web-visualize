    "title": "Unified Prompt Tuning with Semantic Graph Tokens for Scalable Low-Resource Multi-Task NLP",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing prompt tuning techniques for low-resource languages rely on generic tokens and function separately across tasks, leading to scalability and transfer limitations.",
    "Motivation": "Responds directly to the internal gaps about random tokens lacking semantic meaning and siloed prompt tuning by introducing a unified prompt tuning approach leveraging semantic graph tokens shared across multiple NLP tasks for better data efficiency and transfer.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose Unified Semantic Graph Token (USGT) prompt tuning where a shared vocabulary of linguistically meaningful tokens derived from semantic graphs is used as prompt embeddings across multiple tasks (e.g., stance detection, misinformation classification). These tokens capture universal semantic concepts in the target low-resource languages. The USGT module is dynamically composed per task and fed into a foundation model via a prompt tuning interface, enabling multi-task learning with a common interpretable semantic foundation able to transfer knowledge between tasks efficiently.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build semantic graphs from corpora in low-resource languages. 2) Extract universal semantic tokens and create a token vocabulary. 3) Implement USGT prompt tuning replacing random tokens in prompts. 4) Train on multiple low-resource NLP tasks jointly with limited annotated data. 5) Compare with task-specific prompt tuning and zero-shot baselines. 6) Evaluate transfer learning ability, accuracy, and robustness metrics across tasks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multi-task prompt with stance detection and misinformation tasks in Yoruba involving semantic tokens like 'news', 'stance', 'opinion'. Expected output: Improved joint task performance and prompt token interpretability versus baseline.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "In case of limited shared semantic tokens, iteratively expand the token vocabulary or allow task-specific token additions. If multi-task training destabilizes models, employ task-specific adapters in conjunction with USGT."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method briefly states the use of a Unified Semantic Graph Token (USGT) approach but lacks clarity on how semantic graphs are constructed, how semantic tokens are extracted and represented numerically for prompt tuning, and how the dynamic composition mechanism operates technically within the prompt tuning interface. Detailing these mechanisms with algorithmic or architectural clarity would strengthen the soundness of the approach and improve reproducibility and trust in the proposed innovation, especially since semantic graph integration in prompt tuning is complex and requires careful design choices around token selection, embedding initialization, and task conditioning within the foundation model framework. Providing a more explicit description of how USGT achieves transfer and multi-task synergy is critical to assess soundness fully and to convince reviewers of the approachâ€™s novelty beyond popular multi-task or semantic embeddings literature realms. This could be addressed by elaborating on the semantic graph to token pipeline and how this differs or improves over usual learned soft prompt tokens or adapter modules implementations in multi-task contexts, referencing relevant prior work to contextualize contributions effectively within the strong competitive area indicated by the novelty assessment."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the rich globally-linked concepts like 'pre-trained language models', 'semantic alignment', 'efficient transfer learning', and 'multi-task learning', the project could enhance impact and novelty by integrating semantic graph tokens within a Transformer-based foundation model that supports cross-modal semantic alignment. For example, extending USGT prompt tuning to jointly leverage multilingual pre-trained models such as XLM-RoBERTa and incorporating vision-language tasks or code-related tasks could broaden applicability and demonstrate universality of semantic tokens beyond textual inputs. Another concrete suggestion is to explore soft prompt tuning combined with semantic graph tokens to improve few-shot and zero-shot robustness across a wider range of low-resource languages and tasks. This integration would align the method with state-of-the-art techniques and highlight contributions on efficient semantic transfer learning rather than solely relying on low-resource NLP tasks, thereby addressing potential impact limitations and giving a clear path to standing out in the competitive landscape."
