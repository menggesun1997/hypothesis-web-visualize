    "title": "Hierarchical Legal Explanation Generation with Multi-Level Abstraction",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing legal AI explanations often fail to provide multi-level abstraction, limiting their utility for stakeholders needing explanations at different granularityâ€”from high-level case summaries to detailed clause-level reasoning.",
    "Motivation": "By addressing the lack of explanation tailoring to user needs and legal requirements, this idea proposes a hierarchical generation framework that produces explanations traversing multiple abstraction layers, enhancing interpretability, trust, and actionability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a hierarchical explanation generator that outputs multi-scale explanations: (1) a high-level legal summary capturing core decision factors; (2) a mid-level explanation unpacking legal arguments and precedent references; (3) a fine-grained, clause-by-clause rationale with textual evidence. The model incorporates user input to select desired abstraction levels and uses attention mechanisms to maintain coherence across layers.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Annotate legal datasets with multi-level explanation labels. 2) Train hierarchical explanation models using LLMs with multi-task objectives. 3) Evaluate explanations on coherence, completeness, and usefulness across abstraction levels via legal expert assessments. 4) Conduct user studies measuring explanation satisfaction among diverse roles. 5) Compare with flat explanation baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Legal AI judgement on a patent infringement case. Output: (1) A brief explaining ruling outcome; (2) an intermediate explanation detailing precedent influence and argumentation; (3) detailed clause-level rationale mapping evidence to final decision.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If training hierarchical models is data-intensive, use rule-based aggregation of fine-grained explanations for higher-level summaries. Explore semi-supervised training leveraging unlabeled datasets. Adaptively limit abstraction levels based on user needs."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while thorough, lacks specifics about the feasibility of obtaining or annotating legal datasets with multi-level explanation labels. Legal expert annotation can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially for fine-grained clause-level rationales. The plan should discuss strategies for efficiently creating these datasets (e.g., leveraging semi-supervised learning, active learning, or using synthetic data) and provide a clearer timeline or resource estimate. Additionally, the user studies and expert assessments should describe how diverse legal roles will be represented to ensure generalizability of results. Clarifying these points will strengthen confidence in the practical execution of the experiments and their scientific validity, making the plan more robust and actionable within typical project constraints and resources. This improvement is crucial before proceeding to model training and evaluation phases to avoid bottlenecks or unmanageable resource demands in data annotation and evaluation phases, which currently seem under-planned and ambiguous for such a complex hierarchical explanation task.  Target this feedback in the Experiment_Plan section for enhanced clarity and feasibility of experimental validation of the proposal's claims."

          "feedback_content": "Given the idea's novelty has been judged NOV-COMPETITIVE within an active domain, integrating concepts from 'autonomous robots' and 'robot autonomy' could meaningfully broaden its impact and enhance novelty. Specifically, extending the hierarchical explanation framework to legal AI systems guiding autonomous decision-making in robotics (e.g., autonomous robots operating in regulated environments or complex missions) could yield richer multi-level explanations not only for static legal decisions but dynamically evolving legal compliance or ethical reasoning during robot autonomy. This could include generating abstract to detailed legal rationale about rule adherence, safety constraints, and mission-critical decisions that autonomous robots face. Such integration would position the research at the intersection of AI legal explainability and robot autonomy, driving cross-disciplinary innovation and opening new application domains, thereby elevating the proposal beyond existing explanation generation approaches. Suggest incorporating a concrete planned extension or pilot experiment applying the hierarchical explanation model to scenarios involving autonomous robotic systems tasked with legal compliance in complex missions, thereby boosting both novelty and impact significantly. Target this to the Proposed_Method and Motivation sections."
