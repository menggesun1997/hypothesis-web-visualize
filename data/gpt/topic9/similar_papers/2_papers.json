    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence is set to revolutionize healthcare delivery by transforming traditional patient care into a more personalized, efficient, and proactive process. Chatbots, serving as interactive conversational models, will probably drive this patient-centered transformation in healthcare. Through the provision of various services, including diagnosis, personalized lifestyle recommendations, dynamic scheduling of follow-ups, and mental health support, the objective is to substantially augment patient health outcomes, all the while mitigating the workload burden on healthcare providers. The life-critical nature of healthcare applications necessitates establishing a unified and comprehensive set of evaluation metrics for conversational models. Existing evaluation metrics proposed for various generic large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a lack of comprehension regarding medical and health concepts and their significance in promoting patients’ well-being. Moreover, these metrics neglect pivotal user-centered aspects, including trust-building, ethics, personalization, empathy, user comprehension, and emotional support. The purpose of this paper is to explore state-of-the-art LLM-based evaluation metrics that are specifically applicable to the assessment of interactive conversational models in healthcare. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics designed to thoroughly assess the performance of healthcare chatbots from an end-user perspective. These metrics encompass an evaluation of language processing abilities, impact on real-world clinical tasks, and effectiveness in user-interactive conversations. Finally, we engage in a discussion concerning the challenges associated with defining and implementing these metrics, with particular emphasis on confounding factors such as the target audience, evaluation methods, and prompt techniques involved in the evaluation process.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, artificial intelligence has made remarkable strides, improving various aspects of our daily lives. One notable application is in intelligent chatbots that use deep learning models. These systems have shown tremendous promise in the medical sector, enhancing healthcare quality, treatment efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. However, their role in aiding disease diagnosis, particularly chronic conditions, remains underexplored. Addressing this issue, this study employs large language models from the GPT series, in conjunction with deep learning techniques, to design and develop a diagnostic system targeted at chronic diseases. Specifically, performed transfer learning and fine-tuning on the GPT-2 model, enabling it to assist in accurately diagnosing 24 common chronic diseases. To provide a user-friendly interface and seamless interactive experience, we further developed a dialog-based interface, naming it Chat Ella. This system can make precise predictions for chronic diseases based on the symptoms described by users. Experimental results indicate that our model achieved an accuracy rate of 97.50% on the validation set, and an area under the curve (AUC) value reaching 99.91%. Moreover, conducted user satisfaction tests, which revealed that 68.7% of participants approved of Chat Ella, while 45.3% of participants found the system made daily medical consultations more convenient. It can rapidly and accurately assess a patient’s condition based on the symptoms described and provide timely feedback, making it of significant value in the design of medical auxiliary products for household use.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe chatbot application Bennie and the Chats was introduced due to the outbreak of COVID-19, which is aimed to provide substitution for teaching conventional clinical history-taking skills. It was implemented with DialogFlow with preset responses, which consists of a large constraint on responding to different conversations. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, such as the recent introduction of ChatGPT, offers innovative conversational experiences with computer-generated responses. It provides an idea to develop the second generation of Bennie and the Chats. As the epidemic slows, it can become an assisting tool for students as additional exercise. In this work, we present the second generation of Bennie and the Chats with ChatGPT, which provides room for flexible and expandable improvement.MethodsThe objective of this research is to examine the influence of the newly proposed chatbot on learning efficacy and experiences in bedside teaching, and its potential contributions to international teaching collaboration. This study employs a mixed-method design that incorporates both quantitative and qualitative approaches. From the quantitative approach, we launched the world’s first cross-territory virtual bedside teaching with our proposed application and conducted a survey between the University of Hong Kong (HKU) and the National University of Singapore (NUS). Descriptive statistics and Spearman’s Correlation were applied for data analysis. From the qualitative approach, a comparative analysis was conducted between the two versions of the chatbot. And, we discuss the interrelationship between the quantitative and qualitative results.ResultsFor the quantitative result, we collected a questionnaire from 45 students about the evaluation of virtual bedside teaching between territories. Over 75% of the students agreed that teaching can enhance learning effectiveness and experience. Moreover, by exchanging patients cases, 82.2% of students agreed that it helps to gain more experiences with diseases that may not be prevalent in their own locality. For the qualitative result, the new chatbot provides better usability and flexibility.ConclusionVirtual bedside teaching with chatbots has revolutionized conventional bedside teaching by its advantages and allowing international collaborations. We believe that the training of history taking skills by chatbot will be a feasible supplementary teaching tool to conventional bedside teaching.",

    "abstract": "Chatbots have become increasingly popular in the healthcare industry. In the area of preventive care, chatbots can provide personalized and timely solutions that aid individuals in maintaining their well-being and forestalling the development of chronic conditions. This paper presents <i>GECA</i>, a chatbot designed specifically for preventive care, that offers information, advice, and monitoring to patients who are undergoing home treatment, providing a cost-effective, personalized, and engaging solution. Moreover, its adaptable architecture enables extension to other diseases and conditions seamlessly. The chatbot's bilingual capabilities enhance accessibility for a wider range of users, including those with reading or writing difficulties, thereby improving the overall user experience. <i>GECA</i>'s ability to connect with external resources offers a higher degree of personalization, which is a crucial aspect in engaging users effectively. The integration of standards and security protocols in these connections allows patient privacy, security and smooth adaptation to emerging healthcare information sources. <i>GECA</i> has demonstrated a remarkable level of accuracy and precision in its interactions with the diverse features, boasting an impressive 97% success rate in delivering accurate responses. Presently, preparations are underway for a pilot project at a Portuguese hospital that will conduct exhaustive testing and evaluate <i>GECA</i>, encompassing aspects such as its effectiveness, efficiency, quality, goal achievability, and user satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) driving generative artificial intelligence applications heralds the potential of opportunities in health care. We conducted a review up to April 2023 on Google Scholar, Embase, MEDLINE, and Scopus using the following terms: \"large language models,\" \"generative artificial intelligence,\" \"ophthalmology,\" \"ChatGPT,\" and \"eye,\" based on relevance to this review. From a clinical viewpoint specific to ophthalmologists, we explore from the different stakeholders' perspectives-including patients, physicians, and policymakers-the potential LLM applications in education, research, and clinical domains specific to ophthalmology. We also highlight the foreseeable challenges of LLM implementation into clinical practice, including the concerns of accuracy, interpretability, perpetuating bias, and data security. As LLMs continue to mature, it is essential for stakeholders to jointly establish standards for best practices to safeguard patient safety.\nFinancial Disclosures: Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found in the Footnotes and Disclosures at the end of this article.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, has emerged as a transformative tool in healthcare, with the potential to revolutionize clinical decision-making and improve health outcomes. Generative AI, capable of generating new data such as text and images, holds promise in enhancing patient care, revolutionizing disease diagnosis and expanding treatment options. However, the utility and impact of generative AI in healthcare remain poorly understood, with concerns around ethical and medico-legal implications, integration into healthcare service delivery and workforce utilisation. Also, there is not a clear pathway to implement and integrate generative AI in healthcare delivery.MethodsThis article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of generative AI in healthcare, focusing on the utility of the technology in healthcare and its translational application highlighting the need for careful planning, execution and management of expectations in adopting generative AI in clinical medicine. Key considerations include factors such as data privacy, security and the irreplaceable role of clinicians’ expertise. Frameworks like the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the Non-Adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) model are considered to promote responsible integration. These frameworks allow anticipating and proactively addressing barriers to adoption, facilitating stakeholder participation and responsibly transitioning care systems to harness generative AI’s potential.ResultsGenerative AI has the potential to transform healthcare through automated systems, enhanced clinical decision-making and democratization of expertise with diagnostic support tools providing timely, personalized suggestions. Generative AI applications across billing, diagnosis, treatment and research can also make healthcare delivery more efficient, equitable and effective. However, integration of generative AI necessitates meticulous change management and risk mitigation strategies. Technological capabilities alone cannot shift complex care ecosystems overnight; rather, structured adoption programs grounded in implementation science are imperative.ConclusionsIt is strongly argued in this article that generative AI can usher in tremendous healthcare progress, if introduced responsibly. Strategic adoption based on implementation science, incremental deployment and balanced messaging around opportunities versus limitations helps promote safe, ethical generative AI integration. Extensive real-world piloting and iteration aligned to clinical priorities should drive development. With conscientious governance centred on human wellbeing over technological novelty, generative AI can enhance accessibility, affordability and quality of care. As these models continue advancing rapidly, ongoing reassessment and transparent communication around their strengths and weaknesses remain vital to restoring trust, realizing positive potential and, most importantly, improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence (AI) based computational models designed to understand and generate human like text. With billions of training parameters, LLMs excel in identifying intricate language patterns, enabling remarkable performance across a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. After the introduction of transformer architectures, they are impacting the industry with their text generation capabilities. LLMs play an innovative role across various industries by automating NLP tasks. In healthcare, they assist in diagnosing diseases, personalizing treatment plans, and managing patient data. LLMs provide predictive maintenance in automotive industry. LLMs provide recommendation systems, and consumer behavior analyzers. LLMs facilitates researchers and offer personalized learning experiences in education. In finance and banking, LLMs are used for fraud detection, customer service automation, and risk management. LLMs are driving significant advancements across the industries by automating tasks, improving accuracy, and providing deeper insights. Despite these advancements, LLMs face challenges such as ethical concerns, biases in training data, and significant computational resource requirements, which must be addressed to ensure impartial and sustainable deployment. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of LLMs, their evolution, and their diverse applications across industries, offering researchers valuable insights into their transformative potential and the accompanying limitations.",

    "abstract": "At the heart of medicine lies physician–patient dialogue, where skillful history-taking enables effective diagnosis, management and enduring trust1,2. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of diagnostic dialogue could increase accessibility and quality of care. However, approximating clinicians’ expertise is an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a large language model (LLM)-based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue. AMIE uses a self-play-based3 simulated environment with automated feedback for scaling learning across disease conditions, specialties and contexts. We designed a framework for evaluating clinically meaningful axes of performance, including history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management, communication skills and empathy. We compared AMIE’s performance to that of primary care physicians in a randomized, double-blind crossover study of text-based consultations with validated patient-actors similar to objective structured clinical examination4,5. The study included 159 case scenarios from providers in Canada, the United Kingdom and India, 20 primary care physicians compared to AMIE, and evaluations by specialist physicians and patient-actors. AMIE demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on 30 out of 32 axes according to the specialist physicians and 25 out of 26 axes according to the patient-actors. Our research has several limitations and should be interpreted with caution. Clinicians used synchronous text chat, which permits large-scale LLM–patient interactions, but this is unfamiliar in clinical practice. While further research is required before AMIE could be translated to real-world settings, the results represent a milestone towards conversational diagnostic AI.",

    "abstract": "Background: This Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) provides clinicians an overview of Artificial Intelligence, focused on the management of patients with obesity.\nMethods: The perspectives of the authors were augmented by scientific support from published citations and integrated with information derived from search engines (i.e., Chrome by Google, Inc) and chatbots (i.e., Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer or Chat GPT).\nResults: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the technologic acquisition of knowledge and skill by a nonhuman device, that after being initially programmed, has varying degrees of operations autonomous from direct human control, and that performs adaptive output tasks based upon data input learnings. AI has applications regarding medical research, medical practice, and applications relevant to the management of patients with obesity. Chatbots may be useful to obesity medicine clinicians as a source of clinical/scientific information, helpful in writings and publications, as well as beneficial in drafting office or institutional Policies and Procedures and Standard Operating Procedures. AI may facilitate interactive programming related to analyses of body composition imaging, behavior coaching, personal nutritional intervention & physical activity recommendations, predictive modeling to identify patients at risk for obesity-related complications, and aid clinicians in precision medicine. AI can enhance educational programming, such as personalized learning, virtual reality, and intelligent tutoring systems. AI may help augment in-person office operations and telemedicine (e.g., scheduling and remote monitoring of patients). Finally, AI may help identify patterns in datasets related to a medical practice or institution that may be used to assess population health and value-based care delivery (i.e., analytics related to electronic health records).\nConclusions: AI is contributing to both an evolution and revolution in medical care, including the management of patients with obesity. Challenges of Artificial Intelligence include ethical and legal concerns (e.g., privacy and security), accuracy and reliability, and the potential perpetuation of pervasive systemic biases.",
