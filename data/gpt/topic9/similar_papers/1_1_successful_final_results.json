    "title": "Graph-FM Zero-Shot Fusion: Bridging Graph Neural Networks and Foundation Models for Cross-Lingual Low-Resource NLP",
    "Problem_Statement": "Graph neural networks and large foundation models evolve largely in silos, resulting in poor integration that limits leveraging graph-based structure with zero-shot cross-lingual capabilities in low-resource language tasks.",
    "Motivation": "This addresses the integration gap identified as a lack of bridge nodes between prompt tuning and graph-based paradigms (an internal gap), and the external gap of unexploited fusion of semantic knowledge, zero-shot learning, and graph representations for enhanced low-resource NLP, corresponding to Opportunity 2.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid Graph-FM (Foundation Model) Zero-Shot Fusion architecture where graph neural networks encode structural and semantic relations from low-resource language data, and their embeddings are explicitly injected into a foundation model’s attention mechanism to augment its zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning. The system employs a novel graph-to-prompt converter that transforms graph embeddings into dynamic prompts that guide the FM's predictions. This approach grounds the FM’s knowledge with explicit graph representations, enabling better generalization and robustness in low-resource NLP tasks such as stance and misinformation detection.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Obtain multilingual datasets with annotated graphs (e.g., semantic dependency graphs, knowledge bases) from languages like Hausa, Welsh. 2) Pretrain GNNs to capture structural semantic information. 3) Design a graph-to-dynamic prompt module to interface GNN outputs with FM attention layers. 4) Fine-tune cross-lingual foundation models (e.g., XLM-R) with the fused graph prompts under zero-shot and few-shot settings. 5) Compare with models without graph fusion and traditional prompt tuning. 6) Evaluate on benchmarks like XNLI, cross-lingual stance detection with metrics including accuracy and generalization under scarce training data.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Stance detection text in a low-resource language with accompanying graph indicating user relations and semantic concepts. Expected: Model predicts stance correctly with improved zero-shot transfer due to graph prompting compared to FM baseline.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct graph prompting is ineffective, explore late fusion where GNN outputs and FM predictions are combined via ensemble methods. Alternatively, pretrain FMs on graph-augmented corpora or utilize contrastive learning to better align graph and text embeddings."

        "title": "Graph-FM Zero-Shot Fusion: An End-to-End Architecture for Robust Cross-Lingual Low-Resource NLP via Explicit Graph Prompting",
        "Problem_Statement": "Despite recent advances in foundation models (FMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), these paradigms develop largely in isolation, resulting in suboptimal integration for cross-lingual low-resource natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This siloed evolution limits effective fusion of structural graph-based semantics and zero-shot learning capabilities, particularly hindering performance on low-resource languages where training data and annotated graphs are scarce.",
        "Motivation": "While foundation models excel at zero-shot cross-lingual transfer through pretraining on massive multilingual corpora, they lack explicit incorporation of structured semantic and relational knowledge crucial for robust understanding in low-resource scenarios. Existing prompt tuning and adapter techniques inadequately leverage graph-based knowledge, often treating graphs as peripheral information without deep fusion. Recognizing the highly competitive space of FM-graph fusion, this work innovates by designing an end-to-end, differentiable graph-to-prompt injection mechanism directly modulating FM attention layers with dynamic graph embeddings. This explicit fusion enhances semantic alignment and cross-modal knowledge transfer, thereby achieving superior robustness and generalization relative to prior methods, particularly in challenging stance and misinformation detection tasks in low-resource languages. Our approach integrates insights from prefix tuning and contrastive self-supervised learning to stabilize training, mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and adaptively infuse graph-encoded relational knowledge into generative pre-trained transformers, marking a novel advance in graph-augmented multilingual NLP.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an end-to-end Graph-FM Zero-Shot Fusion architecture featuring three primary components: (1) a pretrained Graph Neural Network (GNN) module that encodes structural and semantic relations from low-resource language data into continuous embeddings, trained with self-supervised objectives (e.g., link prediction and node attribute reconstruction) and supplemented with auxiliary graph data projected cross-lingually via distant supervision methods; (2) a novel graph-to-prompt converter, architected as a multi-layer transformer adapter that learns to translate GNN embeddings into dynamic token-level prefix vectors explicitly integrated into the foundation model's cross-attention layers; these graph-derived prefixes are inserted as learnable prompt tokens prepended to input sequences, modulating the FM's internal computations by directly influencing attention weights and contextual representations; crucially, gradient flow is preserved end-to-end across the GNN, graph-to-prompt converter, and FM modules to facilitate coordinated adaptation; (3) fine-tuning of the fused FM (e.g., XLM-R) in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios on downstream low-resource NLP tasks such as stance detection and misinformation classification, leveraging contrastive self-supervised learning objectives to align graph and text embedding spaces, enhancing semantic alignment and robustness. This integration draws on techniques from prefix tuning and prompt embeddings to ensure parameter efficiency and adaptability, while our architecture is designed to prevent catastrophic forgetting by freezing core FM parameters and updating only adapters and prompt modules. The approach explicitly grounds the FM's predictions with structural knowledge, expected to yield superior cross-lingual transfer and performance compared to text-only or late fusion baselines.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Acquisition and Annotation: Collect multilingual datasets including text for low-resource languages (e.g., Hausa, Welsh) focusing on stance and misinformation detection; generate graph annotations via cross-lingual projection (e.g., align semantic dependency graphs or knowledge bases from high-resource languages leveraging bilingual dictionaries and alignment tools) and distant supervision (entity linking and relation extraction utilizing multilingual knowledge bases). 2) GNN Pretraining: Train GNNs on the aggregated graphs using self-supervised objectives like link prediction and attribute reconstruction to obtain robust embeddings despite limited data, augmenting with auxiliary graph datasets from related languages where applicable. 3) Graph-to-Prompt Converter Development: Design and implement a multi-layer transformer adapter to convert GNN embeddings into continuous prefix prompt tokens; integrate these into the FM cross-attention layers at multiple depths, ensuring parameter-efficient tuning. 4) Model Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the fused FM under zero-shot and few-shot settings with contrastive self-supervised learning losses to align graph and textual semantic spaces, freezing the FM backbone to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Employ adversarial training techniques to enhance robustness. 5) Comparative Evaluation: Benchmark against baselines including vanilla FMs with prompt tuning, late fusion ensembles, and adapter-based GNN-FM variants on multilingual stance detection and misinformation datasets, using metrics like accuracy, F1, and cross-lingual generalization under scarce training conditions. 6) Ablation and Robustness Studies: Conduct systematic ablations on graph prompt integration layers, GNN pretraining strategies, and fallback early stopping criteria (e.g., accuracy plateau or training instability) to assess contributions and identify failure modes. 7) Fallback Execution: If training instability or subpar improvements occur, switch to late fusion strategies combining GNN and FM outputs; explore further pretraining on graph-augmented corpora and enhanced contrastive learning to better align modalities.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A stance detection text example in Hausa, accompanied by a graph encoding social connections and semantic relations extracted and projected from English data (e.g., user interaction graph and semantic dependency edges). Expected Output: The model predicts the stance label correctly with higher accuracy than a baseline FM using only text-based prompt tuning, demonstrating improved zero-shot transfer due to explicit graph prompt conditioning. Additional Tests: Cross-lingual misinformation detection in Welsh leveraging structurally informed dynamic prompts showing improved precision and recall compared to late fusion baselines and adapter-only models, especially when training data is limited to few-shot settings.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "We will monitor training convergence and performance metrics rigorously, adopting explicit triggers for fallback if: (a) training converges to marginal improvements under predefined validation thresholds (e.g., <1% gain over baseline), (b) training instability manifests via oscillating losses or catastrophic forgetting symptoms, or (c) graph prompt integration causes bottlenecks. Upon trigger, we switch to late fusion methods combining independently trained GNN and FM predictions through ensembling or gating networks. Alternatively, we will explore enhanced pretraining of FMs on graph-augmented multilingual corpora and deploy more sophisticated contrastive self-supervised objectives to improve alignment between graph-embedded and textual semantic spaces. Throughout, ablation studies and robustness checks will guide iterative improvements and validate the contributions of graph prompting in cross-lingual zero-shot settings."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method outlines a hybrid Graph-FM Zero-Shot Fusion architecture that integrates graph neural network embeddings via a graph-to-prompt converter into a foundation model’s attention mechanism. However, the description lacks sufficient detail on how exactly the graph embeddings are injected into the FM's attention layers, and how dynamic prompts modulate the FM’s internal computations. Clarifying the mechanisms — e.g., the architecture of the graph-to-prompt converter, integration points within attention, and ensuring gradient flow across GNN and FM modules — is vital to establish soundness and reproducibility. Providing a schematic or mathematical formulation would enhance understanding and credibility of the fusion mechanism’s novelty and effectiveness in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer contexts, especially for low-resource NLP tasks where such explicit fusion is challenging yet crucial to justify the approach’s benefits over simpler baseline prompt tuning methods with FMs alone. This clarity would also help assess risks or limitations upfront and guide experimental validation design effectively, improving the rigor of the proposal’s core technical contribution and paving the path for community adoption or further development beyond this competitive space with multiple existing fusion attempts. Please expand this section with architectural details and intuitions about why the proposed fusion should yield superior robustness and generalization on low-resource cross-lingual tasks compared to existing approaches in the literature, referencing relevant attention modulation or graph embedding injection techniques if possible (e.g., adapters, prefix tuning, or learned prompt tokens). This will strengthen the soundness and technical impact of the contribution substantially, given the novelty verdict and the competitive domain it sits in.  \n\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experimental plan is well structured but raises several feasibility concerns that should be addressed to ensure successful execution. First, obtaining multilingual datasets with annotated graphs in low-resource languages like Hausa and Welsh may be very challenging as such graph-annotated resources (semantic dependency graphs, knowledge bases) are scarce or incomplete. The proposal needs a concrete plan for either creating these graph annotations (e.g., via cross-lingual projection, distant supervision) or leveraging existing graph resources reliably. Second, pretraining GNNs on these limited data could be insufficient to learn robust graph embeddings — clarify if additional auxiliary datasets or self-supervised graph tasks will be used to improve generalization. Third, integrating GNN outputs into the FM via the graph-to-prompt module and fine-tuning under zero/few-shot settings is ambitious; explain how potential training instability or catastrophic forgetting risks will be mitigated, especially when fine-tuning large FMs like XLM-R with relatively small low-resource data. Finally, the fallback plan wisely includes late fusion and contrastive learning alternatives but should explicitly describe criteria and triggers to switch to fallback (e.g., failed convergence, marginal improvements). Addressing data availability constraints, training strategies, and evaluation robustness upfront will improve experiment feasibility and increase confidence in successful research outcomes. Consider adding ablation studies and robustness checks to validate the role of graph prompts versus text-only baselines empirically in cross-lingual zero-shot settings.  \n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
