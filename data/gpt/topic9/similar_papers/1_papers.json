    "abstract": "This survey explores the transformative impact of foundation models (FMs) in artificial intelligence, focusing on their integration with federated learning (FL) in biomedical research. Foundation models such as ChatGPT, LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and multimodal patient interactions. The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges, and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs and FL, laying the groundwork for healthcare innovations.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining significant popularity in recent years for specialized tasks using prompts due to their low computational cost. Standard methods like prefix tuning utilize special, modifiable tokens that lack semantic meaning and require extensive training for best performance, often falling short. In this context, we propose a novel method called Semantic Knowledge Tuning (SK-Tuning) for prompt and prefix tuning that employs meaningful words instead of random tokens. This method involves using a fixed LLM to understand and process the semantic content of the prompt through zero-shot capabilities. Following this, it integrates the processed prompt with the input text to improve the model’s performance on particular tasks. Our experimental results show that SK-Tuning exhibits faster training times, fewer parameters, and superior performance on tasks such as text classification and understanding compared to other tuning methods. This approach offers a promising method for optimizing the efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs in processing language tasks.",

    "abstract": "Foundation models have emerged as critical components in a variety of artificial intelligence applications, and showcase significant success in natural language processing and several other domains. Meanwhile, the field of graph machine learning is witnessing a paradigm transition from shallow methods to more sophisticated deep learning approaches. The capabilities of foundation models in generalization and adaptation motivate graph machine learning researchers to discuss the potential of developing a new graph learning paradigm. This paradigm envisions models that are pre-trained on extensive graph data and can be adapted for various graph tasks. Despite this burgeoning interest, there is a noticeable lack of clear definitions and systematic analyses pertaining to this neuicew domain. To this end, this article introduces the concept of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), and offers an exhaustive explanation of their key characteristics and underlying technologies. We proceed to classify the existing work related to GFMs into three distinct categories, based on their dependence on graph neural networks and large language models. In addition to providing a thorough review of the current state of GFMs, this article also outlooks potential avenues for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent decision-making (IDM) is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to automate or augment decision processes. Modern IDM paradigms integrate advanced frameworks to enable intelligent agents to make effective and adaptive choices and decompose complex tasks into manageable steps, such as AI agents and high-level reinforcement learning. Recent advances in multimodal foundation-based approaches unify diverse input modalities-such as vision, language, and sensory data-into a cohesive decision-making process. Foundation models (FMs) have become pivotal in science and industry, transforming decision-making and research capabilities. Their large-scale, multimodal data-processing abilities foster adaptability and interdisciplinary breakthroughs across fields such as healthcare, life sciences, and education. This survey examines IDM's evolution, advanced paradigms with FMs and their transformative impact on decision-making across diverse scientific and industrial domains, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in building efficient, adaptive, and ethical decision systems.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of social media, fake news (rumors) are rampant online, seriously endangering the health of mainstream social consciousness. Fake news detection (FEND), as a machine learning solution for automatically identifying fake news on Internet, is increasingly gaining the attentions of academic community and researchers. Recently, the mainstream FEND approaches relying on deep learning primarily involves fully supervised fine-tuning paradigms based on pre-trained language models (PLMs), relying on large annotated datasets. In many real scenarios, obtaining high-quality annotated corpora are time-consuming, expertise-required, labor-intensive, and expensive, which presents challenges in obtaining a competitive automatic rumor detection system. Therefore, developing and enhancing FEND towards data-scarce scenarios is becoming increasingly essential. In this work, inspired by the superiority of semi-/self- supervised learning, we propose a novel few-shot rumor detection framework based on semi-supervised adversarial learning and self-supervised contrastive learning, named Detection Yet See Few (DetectYSF). DetectYSF synergizes contrastive self-supervised learning and adversarial semi-supervised learning to achieve accurate and efficient FEND capabilities with limited supervised data. DetectYSF uses Transformer-based PLMs (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) as its backbone and employs a Masked LM-based pseudo prompt learning paradigm for model tuning (prompt-tuning). Specifically, during DetectYSF training, the enhancement measures for DetectYSF are as follows: (1) We design a simple but efficient self-supervised contrastive learning strategy to optimize sentence-level semantic embedding representations obtained from PLMs; (2) We construct a Generation Adversarial Network (GAN), utilizing random noises and negative fake news samples as inputs, and employing Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and an extra independent PLM encoder to generate abundant adversarial embeddings. Then, incorporated with the adversarial embeddings, we utilize semi-supervised adversarial learning to further optimize the output embeddings of DetectYSF during its prompt-tuning procedure. From the news veracity dissemination perspective, we found that the authenticity of the news shared by these collectives tends to remain consistent, either mostly genuine or predominantly fake, a theory we refer to as “news veracity dissemination consistency”. By employing an adjacent sub-graph feature aggregation algorithm, we infuse the authenticity characteristics from neighboring news nodes of the constructed veracity dissemination network during DetectYSF inference. It integrates the external supervisory signals from “news veracity dissemination consistency” to further refine the news authenticity detection results of PLM prompt-tuning, thereby enhancing the accuracy of fake news detection. Furthermore, extensive baseline comparisons and ablated experiments on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of DetectYSF for few-shot fake new detection under low-resource scenarios.",

    "title": "Large Language Model Enhanced Logic Tensor Network for Stance Detection",
    "year": 2024,
    "citationCount": 1,
    "fieldCitationRatio": 0.0,
    "abstract": "Social media platforms, rich in user-generated content, offer a unique perspective on public opinion, making stance detection an essential task in opinion mining. However, traditional deep neural networks for stance detection often suffer from limitations, including the requirement for large amounts of labeled data, uninterpretability of prediction results, and difficulty in incorporating human intentions and domain knowledge. This paper introduces the First-Order Logic Aggregated Reasoning framework (FOLAR), an innovative approach that integrates first-order logic (FOL) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance the interpretability and efficacy of stance detection. FOLAR comprises three key components: a Knowledge Elicitation module that generates FOL rules using a chain-of-thought prompting method, a Logic Tensor Network (LTN) that encodes these rules for stance detection, and a Multi-Decision Fusion mechanism that aggregates LTNs' outputs to minimize biases and improve robustness. Our experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of FOLAR, showing it as a promising solution for explainable and accurate stance detection. The source code will be made publicly available to foster further research.",
