    "title": "Supervised Contrastive Learning for Explainable Social Bias Detection",
    "Problem_Statement": "Detecting subtle and context-dependent biases in social media text requires models that not only perform well but also provide explainable rationale for decisions, which current methods lack sufficiently.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap of subtle bias detection and opacity by expanding on Opportunity 1 to specifically utilize supervised contrastive learning to enhance decision boundaries while maintaining interpretability through attention mechanisms, a novel combination as per the research map.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Train large transformer-based LLM encoders with supervised contrastive loss to cluster biased and non-biased examples separately in embedding space, improving sensitivity. Integrate attention visualization to output human-readable feature importance for bias indications. Incorporate a bias explanation module that summarizes detected bias types in natural language based on salient features.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Prepare bias-labeled social media datasets with diverse bias categories. 2. Fine-tune pre-trained transformers with supervised contrastive loss. 3. Implement attention-based explanation visualization. 4. Benchmark against standard cross-entropy models and other explainability methods. 5. Measure bias detection metrics, embedding space separability, and explanation qualitative assessments.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Users from group Y are always untrustworthy.\" Output: Bias detected=Yes; Explanation: attention weights highlight \"always untrustworthy\" phrase; Bias type=stereotype attribution.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If supervised contrastive training hampers model generalization, incorporate hybrid training with cross-entropy loss or leverage semi-supervised contrastive learning to boost robustness."

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experimental plan lacks details on how the quality and effectiveness of the natural language bias explanations will be quantitatively or qualitatively evaluated. Given the focus on explainability, it is critical to clearly define metrics or user studies that assess the relevance, correctness, and human interpretability of the attention-based explanations and the summary bias type explanations. Additionally, the plan should address potential data imbalance among diverse bias categories and how this will be mitigated during fine-tuning or evaluation to ensure robust detection across groups and contexts. Clarifying these aspects will greatly strengthen the feasibility and scientific rigor of the experiments, ensuring meaningful validation of the proposed method's core claims and interpretability components. This refinement should be prioritized to avoid ambiguity in evaluation and to ensure practical validity of the proposed explanations and detection performance in real-world social media scenarios. The experiment plan section should be expanded accordingly to include these evaluation protocols and data considerations for stronger feasibility assurance, and to support clear comparison against baselines including standard cross-entropy and other explainability methods as planned."

          "feedback_content": "To enhance the impact and novelty in a competitive space, integrate well-established Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods from the globally linked concepts such as advanced Transformer-based attention visualization techniques combined with state-of-the-art word embeddings. Incorporating specialized model components like convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks (e.g., LSTM) for capturing spatial or sequential nuances in social media text might enrich feature extraction beyond standard transformers. Leveraging these synergistic concepts can amplify bias detection sensitivity and explanation granularity. Additionally, incorporating techniques from forgery detection or digital forensic methods to identify manipulation or deceptive language might expand the model's application scope and generalization robustness. This cross-pollination can address the competitive novelty constraint and broaden societal impact by making the model applicable beyond direct bias spotting to related trustworthiness and misinformation detection tasks. A concrete next step would be to prototype such multi-modal or hybrid architectures and evaluate their gains over the current purely transformer and supervised contrastive learning framework."
