        "title": "Federated Empathy-Driven LLMs for Secure Healthcare Dialogue",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current healthcare conversational AI systems lack robust privacy mechanisms while failing to capture nuanced empathy and trust, essential for patient engagement and adherence. Traditional centralized training exposes sensitive data and cannot scale across institutions in real time.",
        "Motivation": "This project addresses internal gaps (1) Evaluation challenges on empathy and trust, (2) Privacy and security concerns, and external gap (a) incorporation of federated learning and privacy-preserving protocols. It innovatively unites federated learning with an empathy-aware LLM evaluation framework to ensure both clinical relevance and patient confidentiality across multi-institutional deployments.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a federated learning system where multiple healthcare providers collaboratively train a large language model for conversational AI without sharing raw patient data. Integrate novel empathy and trust prediction modules into the LLM architecture using multi-task learning. Develop an empathy-comprehension clinical metric benchmark by combining NLP-based sentiment analysis with patient satisfaction scores gathered longitudinally post-interaction. Implement differential privacy and secure aggregation protocols to protect privacy during federated optimization.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Collection: Partner with 3-5 healthcare institutions to obtain distributed conversational datasets under privacy agreements. 2. Model Development: Pre-train a base LLM, then implement federated fine-tuning with the empathy and trust modules. Compare against centralized baseline models. 3. Evaluation: Apply newly developed clinical empathy-trust metrics, traditional NLP metrics (BLEU, ROUGE), and user trust surveys. 4. Security Testing: Validate privacy guarantees through penetration testing and membership inference attacks simulation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient: \"I'm worried about my chronic pain worsening.\" LLM Output: \"I understand that chronic pain can be challenging. Let's explore ways to manage your discomfort effectively, together.\" Expected: Response demonstrates empathy, reassures, and suggests collaborative management, improving trust scores.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated learning yields unstable or slow convergence, fallback to a hybrid approach where only gradient-level updates are federated combined with local fine-tuning. If empathy modules are insufficient, incorporate reinforcement learning from human feedback focused on empathetic responses."

        "title": "Big Data-Informed Adaptive Conversational AI for Personalized Chronic Disease Management",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing healthcare chatbots inadequately adapt to evolving patient contexts and diverse populations, limiting personalization and patient trust for chronic disease management over time.",
        "Motivation": "This tackles gap (3) Usability and integration with insufficient real-world longitudinal validation and opportunity (2) combining big data analytics/smart healthcare systems with qualitative feedback to build adaptive, context-aware AI that dynamically personalizes patient interactions and engagement.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a context-aware conversational AI integrating big data from electronic health records (EHRs), wearable devices, and patient-reported outcomes to create dynamic patient profiles. Employ continual learning techniques to adapt the language model responses based on real-time patient state changes. Use reinforcement learning from qualitative feedback loops capturing user satisfaction, trust, and comprehension to optimize dialogue strategies. Leverage sensor and environmental data for situational context refinement to recommend actionable insights tailored to life course health trajectories.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Gather multimodal datasets: EHR, wearable sensor streams, patient interviews for chronic diseases (e.g., obesity, hepatology). 2. Develop LLM-based dialogue agent with modular patient state encoders integrating real-time updates. 3. Conduct a longitudinal user study for 6 months measuring adaptation and user trust. 4. Benchmark against static chatbots on personalization metrics, adherence rates, and user trust indices.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient: \"I felt tired and skipped exercises yesterday.\" Real-time data: Low step count, elevated heart rate variability. Output: \"I noticed you had a tough day yesterday. Would you like some gentle activities tailored for today to help regain your energy?\" Expected: Adaptive, context-aware suggestion improving user adherence and satisfaction.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time adaptation is unstable, implement semi-supervised periodic retraining cycles with batch updates. If patient feedback is sparse, supplement with synthetic data augmentation and simulated dialogs."

Create a specialized evaluation benchmark combining clinical accuracy, diagnostic concordance, and user comprehension. Integrate knowledge graph representations of ophthalmic concepts to improve reasoning and fact consistency during conversations.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Acquisition: Collect annotated transcripts and paired retinal imaging data from collaborating centers. 2. LLM Fine-Tuning: Use domain-adaptive training on the enriched dataset, including multimodal fusion layers. 3. Benchmark Creation: Develop a new ophthalmology conversational evaluation with clinician-in-the-loop validations. 4. Comparative Analysis: Measure against generic medical chatbots on diagnostic accuracy, user satisfaction, and error rates.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient: \"I've noticed blurred vision and floaters recently.\" Supporting input: Retina scan images attached. Output: \"Based on your symptoms and retinal scan, you might be experiencing early signs of diabetic retinopathy. I recommend a detailed consultation with your ophthalmologist promptly.\" Expected: Domain-specific, multimodal clinically accurate advice improving early detection.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal fusion is technically challenging, fallback to text-only fine-tuning with image summary metadata. If dataset scale is insufficient, use data augmentation via synthetic clinical scenarios and image synthesis."
