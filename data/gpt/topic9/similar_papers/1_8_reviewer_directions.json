    "title": "Dynamic Graph-Prompt Assembly for Context-Aware Zero-Shot Low-Resource Text Classification",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current prompt tuning and graph-based models do not dynamically assemble prompts contextualized by graph structural information, limiting performance in zero-shot low-resource classification tasks.",
    "Motivation": "This idea bridges the silo gap between prompt tuning and graph paradigms (internal gap), implementing a system that dynamically composes graph-informed prompts to improve zero-shot performance, aligned with Opportunities 1 and 2.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct Dynamic Graph-Prompt Assembly (DGPA) system where a graph encoder analyzes text and external semantic graphs to extract task-relevant subgraphs. These subgraphs inform prompt template generation dynamically customized per input context. The assembled prompt is fed to an LLM for classification tasks such as stance detection or misinformation identification in low-resource languages. This approach enables context-aware zero-shot reasoning grounded in structural semantic knowledge.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets with semantic graph annotations in low-resource languages. 2) Train a graph encoder to identify salient subgraphs given input text context. 3) Develop prompt templates conditioned on extracted subgraphs. 4) Integrate with foundation models pretrained for zero-shot inference. 5) Evaluate on zero-shot and few-shot classification benchmarks. 6) Metrics: classification accuracy, prompt efficiency, and semantic relevance of generated prompts.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Tweet in Wolof with associated semantic social network graph. DGPA extracts stance-related subgraph and composes prompt: 'Given user's network and topic, is the stance positive?'. Output: Correct stance label with better zero-shot accuracy than standard prompts.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic prompt assembly introduces noise, affirm prompt quality by reinforcement learning or human curation. Alternatively, fix prompt templates but enhance graph embeddings to encode context."
