    "title": "Hierarchical Legal Explanation Generation with Multi-Level Abstraction",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing legal AI explanations often fail to provide multi-level abstraction, limiting their utility for stakeholders needing explanations at different granularity—from high-level case summaries to detailed clause-level reasoning.",
    "Motivation": "By addressing the lack of explanation tailoring to user needs and legal requirements, this idea proposes a hierarchical generation framework that produces explanations traversing multiple abstraction layers, enhancing interpretability, trust, and actionability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a hierarchical explanation generator that outputs multi-scale explanations: (1) a high-level legal summary capturing core decision factors; (2) a mid-level explanation unpacking legal arguments and precedent references; (3) a fine-grained, clause-by-clause rationale with textual evidence. The model incorporates user input to select desired abstraction levels and uses attention mechanisms to maintain coherence across layers.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Annotate legal datasets with multi-level explanation labels. 2) Train hierarchical explanation models using LLMs with multi-task objectives. 3) Evaluate explanations on coherence, completeness, and usefulness across abstraction levels via legal expert assessments. 4) Conduct user studies measuring explanation satisfaction among diverse roles. 5) Compare with flat explanation baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Legal AI judgement on a patent infringement case. Output: (1) A brief explaining ruling outcome; (2) an intermediate explanation detailing precedent influence and argumentation; (3) detailed clause-level rationale mapping evidence to final decision.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If training hierarchical models is data-intensive, use rule-based aggregation of fine-grained explanations for higher-level summaries. Explore semi-supervised training leveraging unlabeled datasets. Adaptively limit abstraction levels based on user needs."

        "title": "Hierarchical Legal Explanation Generation for Autonomous Robot Decision-Making in Regulated Environments",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing legal AI explanations often provide single-level summaries that fail to capture the diverse abstraction needs of varied stakeholders. This limitation is more pronounced in domains where autonomous robots operate in legally regulated and safety-critical environments, requiring dynamic and context-aware legal reasoning explanations at multiple levels — from high-level compliance summaries to granular, clause-specific rationale supporting real-time autonomous decisions.",
        "Motivation": "While hierarchical explanation techniques exist, they generally focus on static legal judgements and do not address the challenges of autonomous robotic systems operating amidst evolving legal, ethical, and safety constraints. By advancing a multi-level explanation framework tailored for such complex, autonomous contexts, this research aims to bridge AI legal explainability with robot autonomy. This integration not only enhances interpretability, trust, and actionable insight for diverse stakeholders—legal experts, roboticists, end-users—but also elevates the novelty by situating the solution at the intersection of legal AI and robotic regulatory compliance. Thus, it broadens the impact beyond static legal cases to dynamically evolving mission contexts requiring fine-grained and adaptable explanations of legal adherence and ethical constraints embedded in autonomous robotic decisions.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hierarchical explanation generation framework that constructs multi-scale, user-tailored legal rationales in autonomous robot missions operating under legal and ethical regulations. The method includes: (1) a high-level summary explaining overall legal compliance and mission-critical safety constraints; (2) a mid-level unpacking of legal arguments, precedent influence, and dynamic rule adaptations impacting current mission stages; (3) a fine-grained clause-by-clause rationale linking laws, regulations, and operational constraints directly to autonomous decision-making modules. The model incorporates user input for selecting abstraction levels and adapts explanations in real-time to robot mission evolution. Attention mechanisms and cross-layer coherence models ensure explanation consistency. This approach uniquely integrates legal AI explanations with robot autonomy, enabling dynamic, multi-layered legal reasoning transparency for autonomous systems in complex, regulated environments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Efficient Data Annotation: Initiate by collecting legal texts and autonomous robot mission logs, and leverage a hybrid annotation approach combining semi-supervised learning, active learning strategies, and synthetic data generation to create multi-level explanation labels, drastically reducing manual legal expert time. 2) Pilot Annotation Study: Collaborate with a small, diverse panel of legal experts and roboticists to validate annotation schemas and optimize guidelines, focusing on clause-level rationales pertinent to robot autonomy. 3) Model Training: Train hierarchical explanation models using large language models with multi-task objectives, incorporating domain adaptation for autonomous systems' data. 4) Evaluation by Multi-Domain Experts: Organize thorough expert assessments spanning legal scholars, robotics engineers, and ethicists to evaluate explanation coherence, completeness, and usefulness across abstraction layers, ensuring representativeness of diverse legal roles and operational contexts. 5) Comprehensive User Studies: Conduct user studies with stakeholders from legal, robotics, and end-user communities to measure explanation satisfaction, trust, and decision support value, ensuring statistically sound samples and diverse role inclusion. 6) Baseline Comparisons: Benchmark against flat and single-level explanation baselines from both legal AI and robot autonomy domains. The overall annotation and evaluation timeline is planned over 12-18 months with dedicated resource allocation to legal-robotics cross-disciplinary collaboration, enabling scalable and feasible execution.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Autonomous robot mission involving delivery drones operating in a city with evolving privacy laws and no-fly zones. Output: (1) A high-level summary explaining the drone's compliance with privacy and airspace rules during the mission; (2) an intermediate explanation detailing how specific legal precedents and dynamic rule changes influenced route planning and operational constraints; (3) a detailed clause-level rationale mapping legal clauses and regulatory conditions to decision modules for route adjustments and emergency stop mechanisms.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If fully automated multi-level annotation proves too resource-intensive, deploy rule-based aggregation of fine-grained explanations to generate higher-level summaries, using domain heuristics from legal and robotic autonomy experts. Further, leverage semi-supervised and transfer learning techniques from related domains to reduce annotation dependence. Adaptively constrain the number of abstraction layers based on user feedback and computational resources, focusing on the most impactful levels for target user groups. Also, explore simulation environments to synthetically generate annotated data linked to robot autonomous decisions under legal constraints."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while thorough, lacks specifics about the feasibility of obtaining or annotating legal datasets with multi-level explanation labels. Legal expert annotation can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially for fine-grained clause-level rationales. The plan should discuss strategies for efficiently creating these datasets (e.g., leveraging semi-supervised learning, active learning, or using synthetic data) and provide a clearer timeline or resource estimate. Additionally, the user studies and expert assessments should describe how diverse legal roles will be represented to ensure generalizability of results. Clarifying these points will strengthen confidence in the practical execution of the experiments and their scientific validity, making the plan more robust and actionable within typical project constraints and resources. This improvement is crucial before proceeding to model training and evaluation phases to avoid bottlenecks or unmanageable resource demands in data annotation and evaluation phases, which currently seem under-planned and ambiguous for such a complex hierarchical explanation task.  Target this feedback in the Experiment_Plan section for enhanced clarity and feasibility of experimental validation of the proposal's claims."

          "feedback_content": "Given the idea's novelty has been judged NOV-COMPETITIVE within an active domain, integrating concepts from 'autonomous robots' and 'robot autonomy' could meaningfully broaden its impact and enhance novelty. Specifically, extending the hierarchical explanation framework to legal AI systems guiding autonomous decision-making in robotics (e.g., autonomous robots operating in regulated environments or complex missions) could yield richer multi-level explanations not only for static legal decisions but dynamically evolving legal compliance or ethical reasoning during robot autonomy. This could include generating abstract to detailed legal rationale about rule adherence, safety constraints, and mission-critical decisions that autonomous robots face. Such integration would position the research at the intersection of AI legal explainability and robot autonomy, driving cross-disciplinary innovation and opening new application domains, thereby elevating the proposal beyond existing explanation generation approaches. Suggest incorporating a concrete planned extension or pilot experiment applying the hierarchical explanation model to scenarios involving autonomous robotic systems tasked with legal compliance in complex missions, thereby boosting both novelty and impact significantly. Target this to the Proposed_Method and Motivation sections."
