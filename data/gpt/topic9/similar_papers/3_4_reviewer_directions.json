    "title": "User-Adaptive Explainability Profiles for Legal AI Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current explainability approaches often present generic explanations, failing to adapt content to the diverse expertise and informational needs of legal user types, from laypeople to expert lawyers, limiting effectiveness and trust.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing a core internal gap on user-tailored explanation content, this research innovates by creating dynamic explanation profiles that modulate explanation depth, format, and focus based on user modeling, enhancing legal AI transparency and usability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an adaptive explainability engine that classifies users into personas (e.g., judge, lawyer, client, paralegal) and dynamically generates explanations optimized for their information needs using layered explanation templates, controlled natural language simplification, and domain-specific summarization. The system uses feedback loops to refine profiles and explanation styles over time, ensuring relevance and clarity.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Identify common legal user personas and collate their explanation requirements via surveys. 2) Develop personas and corresponding explanation templates covering multiple complexity levels. 3) Integrate adaptive explanation generation with LLM workflows on legal NLP tasks. 4) Conduct user studies evaluating comprehension, trust, decision-making accuracy across personas. 5) Iterate profile refinement through active learning based on user interactions.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Legal AI analyzing a property deed for a client vs. a licensed broker. Expected Output: Client receives simplified, jargon-free reasoning with key risks; broker receives detailed clause analysis with references to legal precedents and statutes.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If user personas prove too coarse, implement continuous user modeling based on interaction patterns. Alternatively, provide customizable explanation settings for manual user control. Use A/B testing to identify optimal granularity levels for each persona."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is broadly outlined but lacks crucial operational details that would ensure scientific rigour and practical feasibility. For instance, the process for accurately identifying and validating legal user personas and their explanation requirements through surveys is not detailed, which is critical given the variability in legal roles and expertise. Moreover, integration with LLM workflows is mentioned without specifying which models or datasets will be employed, nor how feedback loops and active learning will concretely be applied to refine profiles. I recommend strengthening your experimental methodology by defining precise metrics for evaluation beyond comprehension and trust (e.g., measurable decision-making improvements), elaborating on recruitment strategies for diverse legal participants to avoid sampling bias, and clarifying how active learning will be operationalized in this domain, potentially with pilot studies to iterate on explanation templates before full deployment. This will bolster the plan’s feasibility and reproducibility substantially, a must for this inherently complex and domain-sensitive system design, especially in legal contexts where inaccuracies have high stakes.

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty status of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the inherently multidisciplinary nature of your work, integrating concepts such as 'user-centered design', the 'Theory of Acceptance', and 'System Usability Scale' could significantly enhance both impact and methodological strength. For example, embedding established user acceptance models can systematically inform your persona design and adaptive explanation evaluation measures, grounding them in broader human-computer interaction literature. Additionally, leveraging federated learning could address privacy concerns when collecting user feedback data from distributed legal entities and clients, enhancing system scalability and ethical compliance. Incorporating deep learning techniques, perhaps via domain-adapted 'language models' for legal text summarization and controlled simplification, would solidify the AI backbone. This holistic integration aligns your legal AI explainability innovation with proven AI, HCI, and privacy preservation frameworks, differentiating it more distinctly in this competitive area while expanding practical and theoretical relevance.
