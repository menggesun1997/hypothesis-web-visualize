    "title": "Ethical Design Framework for Trustworthy Legal AI Explainability",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of ethical design considerations embedded in legal AI explainability tools undermines user trust and risks non-compliance with societal and legal values.",
    "Motivation": "This research responds to the internal gap in ethical design incorporation by developing a comprehensive ethical design framework specifically tailored for explainability in legal AI, synthesizing Bridge2AI ethical principles, legal norms, and explainability best practices.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build an ethical design framework integrating principles of fairness, transparency, privacy, and accountability directly into explainability algorithms and system interfaces. Includes checklists, ethical risk assessment tools, and embedding normative constraints into explanation generation. This ensures explanations do not reinforce biases or mislead users about AIâ€™s decision capabilities.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Review ethical guidelines and legal standards related to AI explainability. 2) Define measurable ethical criteria for legal AI explanations. 3) Develop tools to audit explanations for ethical risks including bias, misinformation, and privacy violations. 4) Implement these tools within an explainability system prototype. 5) Evaluate ethical effectiveness through expert panels and user trust surveys.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Automated decision on loan eligibility from legal contract terms. Output: Explanation incorporating disclaimers about model limitations, highlighting potential biases and fairness considerations, aligned with ethical framework recommendations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If embedding ethical constraints reduces explanation clarity, create layered explanations separating factual from ethical content. Provide user customization to balance ethical transparency with usability. Iteratively update framework based on stakeholder feedback."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-MECHANISM",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed method lacks concrete and detailed mechanisms for integrating ethical principles directly into explainability algorithms. Specifically, it remains unclear how normative constraints will technically influence explanation generation while preserving interpretability and user trust. Clarify and potentially prototype specific algorithmic designs or formal models demonstrating how ethical criteria modulate explanation outputs to avoid reinforcing bias or misinformation, rather than relying on broad concepts like checklists and risk assessments alone. This will strengthen the soundness of the approach and reduce ambiguity for reviewers and stakeholders operating at the algorithmic level, ensuring ethical embedding is not merely conceptual but actionable and measurable within the system interface and explanation generation pipeline as claimed, thus improving clarity and rigor in your core methodology section (Proposed_Method)."

        {
          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The experimental plan should clearly specify how measurable ethical criteria are operationalized and validated quantitatively or qualitatively before auditing explanations. For example, detail what metrics or validated instruments will be used in expert panels and user trust surveys, how ethical risks (bias, misinformation, privacy) will be quantitatively detected or scored, and whether the evaluation datasets represent diverse legal contexts. Additionally, the fallback plan for layered explanations and user customization requires concrete user study designs to balance ethical transparency with usability. Consider piloting these steps early to identify challenges. Without these clarifications, the feasibility of the experimentation demonstrating effectiveness and real-world usability remains uncertain, risking superficial validation. Strengthening this section (Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan) will boost confidence in the framework's practical applicability and scientific rigor."
