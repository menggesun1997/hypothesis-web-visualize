    "title": "Adaptive CNN-Guided Quantization for Transformer NLP Models on Memristor Arrays",
    "Problem_Statement": "Transformer models for NLP require aggressive quantization to fit memristor edge hardware, but static quantization degrades model performance and robustness. CNNs are underused to guide adaptive quantization tailored to local structural features within transformer layers in edge IoT NLP contexts.",
    "Motivation": "This proposal targets underutilization of CNNs as adaptive bridges for efficient model compression in transformers from the critical gaps and aligns with innovation opportunity 2 of hybrid CNN-transformer architectures for analog computing-based compression.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive quantization framework where convolutional modules analyze intermediate transformer embeddings to identify sensitive regions requiring higher precision. Quantization levels are varied dynamically per layer or token region informed by CNN feature maps to optimize accuracy versus compression tradeoffs. The quantized transformer is mapped to memristor crossbar arrays with precision variability support. This CNN-guided quantization enables edge NLP models that maintain high performance while conforming to hardware constraints in IoT deployments.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Use NLP benchmarks for IoT settings such as SLURP, Google Speech Commands. 2. Models: Baselines include uniform quantized transformer and CNN-transformed guided quantized transformer. 3. Metrics: Model accuracy, quantization bits per weight, energy consumption, inference latency. 4. Test quantization impact per layer and per token region. 5. Simulate memristor-based inference and evaluate robustness to hardware noise.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Command \"Increase temperature\" with localized contextual tokens receiving 8-bit precision while function words assigned 4-bit. Output: Accurate command classification at 91% accuracy with 50% bit reduction and 30% energy savings relative to baseline uniform quantization.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive quantization introduces complexity hindering hardware mapping, revert to CNN-guided static quantization with clustered precision levels. Evaluate simpler sensitivity-based quantization informed by gradient norms if CNN features prove insufficient."

        "title": "Hardware-Aware CNN-Guided Adaptive Quantization for Transformer NLP Models on Memristor Arrays Optimized for Resource-Constrained AIoT Edge Devices",
        "Problem_Statement": "Transformer models for NLP deployed on memristor-based edge hardware in AIoT devices require aggressive quantization for memory and energy efficiency. However, conventional static quantization approaches degrade model accuracy and robustness, especially under memristor noise and crossbar variability. Moreover, current adaptive quantization lacks explicit, hardware-aware mechanisms to leverage local embedding sensitivities dynamically, limiting effective tradeoffs between accuracy, energy, and latency on real memristor arrays. There is a need for a transparent, co-designed adaptive quantization framework that incorporates CNN modules to analyze transformer intermediate embeddings for precision allocation, while explicitly accounting for resource constraints and hardware noise characteristics in AIoT edge deployments.",
        "Motivation": "While hybrid CNN-transformer architectures and memristor-based analog computing have been studied individually, their synergy for adaptive quantization in resource-constrained AIoT edge NLP remains underexplored. Our work innovates by tightly integrating convolutional sensitivity analysis modules with transformer layers to dynamically guide per-token and per-layer quantization precision. By incorporating co-designed software-hardware optimization strategies, including noise-aware quantization level selection compatible with memristor crossbar precision variability, our framework addresses critical bottlenecks in edge deployment. This positions our proposal beyond prior conceptions offering clearly delineated mechanisms, hardware mapping strategies, and demonstrations on AIoT-relevant benchmarks, showcasing improvements in accuracy, energy efficiency, and inference latency tailored to memristor-based DNN accelerators under real-world noise conditions.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hardware-aware adaptive quantization framework comprising:\n\n1. CNN Guidance Module: A lightweight multi-scale convolutional neural network analyses intermediate transformer embeddings per layer and token. This module extracts spatial feature maps indicating token-level and layer-level sensitivity to quantization, leveraging multi-scale feature extraction inspired by CNN architectures optimized for efficiency.\n\n2. Precision Selection Mechanism: Using learned CNN feature maps combined with hardware noise and variation models of memristor crossbars, we compute quantization bit allocations per token region and layer via an adaptive policy network trained end-to-end with a distillation loss to balance accuracy, bit reduction, and noise robustness.\n\n3. Integration & Training: The CNN guidance and precision selector are tightly integrated with the transformer model, allowing backpropagation of task loss and hardware-aware constraints to jointly optimize model weights and quantization strategies.\n\n4. Hardware Co-Design: We provide detailed pseudo-code describing the per-inference step where embeddings pass through CNN layers to produce precision maps, which dynamically control quantization modules. We also present circuit-level illustrations showing mapping of variable precision weights to memristor crossbars with support for precision variability and noise mitigation techniques.\n\n5. Edge Deployment Focus: Our method explicitly targets resource-constrained AIoT edge devices by incorporating latency and energy modeling into training, enabling optimized tradeoffs suitable for real memristor-based DNN accelerators.\n\nThis approach unifies advances in multi-scale CNN sensitivity analysis, co-design of quantization and hardware noise models, and transformer efficiency in a reproducible, transparent framework unprecedented for memristor edge NLP.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Beyond classic IoT NLP benchmarks SLURP and Google Speech Commands, extend to AIoT domains including human activity recognition datasets (e.g., UCI HAR), which couple sequence modeling with noisy sensor domains.\n2. Baselines: Compare with uniform static quantized transformers, transformers with existing static quantization heuristics, and non-hardware-aware adaptive quantization.\n3. Metrics: Evaluate model accuracy, per-layer and per-token quantization bits, end-to-end inference latency, energy consumption (from hardware simulator data), and robustness to memristor noise and variation via detailed simulation.\n4. Ablation: Study impact of CNN design choices (scales and depths), precision selection policies, and noise models.\n5. Hardware Validation: Deploy quantized models on memristor array emulators and investigate noise-robustness and precision variability handling.\n6. Cross-analysis: Assess efficiency and robustness improvements when co-optimizing quantization with hardware-aware constraints vs naive approaches.\n7. Document experiment reproducibility with pseudo-code and architectural diagrams for CNN-guidance and hardware mapping.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Voice command \"Increase temperature\" where the CNN-guided module assigns 8-bit precision to contextually critical tokens ('Increase', 'temperature') and 4-bit to less sensitive function words ('the'). Output: Command classification accuracy achieves 91.5%, a 50% reduction in average quantization bits per weight, resulting in 30% lower energy consumption and 20% faster inference latency on simulated memristor arrays with noise compared to uniform quantization.\n\nSecond Example: On human activity recognition sensor data, token segments identified as noise-sensitive by CNN guidance receive higher precision, improving overall recognition accuracy by 4% under memristor noise conditions versus static quantization baselines.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the dynamic CNN-guided adaptive quantization proves computationally or hardware complexity-prohibitive in edge deployment, revert to a hybrid approach of CNN-guided static quantization that clusters tokens and layers into a few precision levels based on average sensitivity, reducing inference overhead.\nIf CNN feature maps insufficiently capture sensitivity, explore alternative sensitivity metrics based on gradient norms or attention weights with hardware noise modeling.\nAdditional fallback involves applying offline hardware-aware post-training quantization refinement using distillation losses to mitigate noise impact without runtime precision adaptation."

Specifically, the mechanism by which convolutional feature maps dynamically direct per-token or per-layer quantization precision is underspecified. Details on the architecture and training regime of the CNN guidance module, integration with transformer layers, and how precision levels are selected and updated during inference need elaboration to evaluate soundness and reproducibility rigorously. Providing pseudo-code or circuit mapping illustrations would strengthen methodological transparency and support peer assessment of feasibility on memristor arrays with precision variability constraints as claimed in the motivation and problem statement sections. This clarity is fundamental to trust that adaptive quantization can effectively trade off accuracy and compression in the proposed hardware context rather than being conceptual or anecdotal only. Please address this critical mechanism detail gap as the foremost priority for soundness and confidence in the approach's robustness and implementation practicality."
