    "Problem_Statement": "Existing large language models (LLMs) and deep learning approaches for social media text analysis suffer from opacity and limited interpretability, impeding effective bias detection and legal accountability. This limits trustworthiness and practical adoption in socially sensitive contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of AI opacity and limited explainability by leveraging the 'hidden bridge' linking support vector machines (SVMs) and legal frameworks with natural language processing (NLP), enabling transparent bias auditing aligned with privacy and fairness concerns.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid architecture wherein an LLM generates dense embeddings of social media text, feeding into an interpretable, kernel-based SVM classifier trained with supervised contrastive learning to detect biased language. Additionally, the SVM outputs rationale maps highlighting influential features for bias flags. This system incorporates a legal-aware module that translates detected biases into compliance risk scores based on tailored social media legal policies.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use benchmark social media datasets labeled for bias (e.g., Twitter Hate Speech dataset) and augment with newly carefully labeled fairness evaluation sets. 2. Train baseline LLM bias classifiers (e.g., BERT fine-tuned). 3. Develop and train the hybrid LLM+SVM model with interpretability constraints. 4. Evaluate bias detection F1 scores, explainability metrics (fidelity, coherence), and legal compliance estimation accuracy. 5. Conduct user studies with legal experts to assess output interpretability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"All people of group X are unreliable.\" Expected Output: Bias Detection=True; Explanation highlighting phrase \"all people of group X\" as stereotype; Compliance Risk Score=High under civil rights statute violation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If the SVM interpretability does not sufficiently clarify decisions, switch to a neuro-symbolic approach leveraging rule-based legal logic overlays on LLM outputs. Alternatively, integrate post-hoc explainers (e.g., LIME) to enhance transparency."

        "title": "Legally-Interpretable Hybrid NLP-SVM Framework for Bias Auditing in Social Media Text with Systematic Rationale Mapping",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing large language models (LLMs) and deep learning approaches for social media text analysis suffer from opacity and limited interpretability, impeding effective bias detection and legal accountability. This opacity limits trustworthiness and practical adoption in socially sensitive contexts such as forensic psychiatry, criminal justice, and financial sector discourse, where transparent and legally-informed bias auditing is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work integrates LLM embeddings with SVM classifiers for bias detection, the lack of rigorously defined interpretability mechanisms and formal legal compliance integration limits novelty and practical utility. This proposal uniquely contributes by establishing a well-defined, kernel-based feature relevance method to generate token-level rationale maps from SVM classifiers, systematically bridging them to a modular legal knowledge representation. By embedding domain-specific legal rules (e.g., civil rights statutes relevant to social media content) and smart risk estimation within an ontology-driven legal module, the framework offers a novel, transparent, and legally accountable bias auditing tool tailored for high-stakes sectors like criminal justice and finance, advancing beyond current competitive baselines.",
        "Proposed_Method": "The core innovation lies in a hybrid two-stage architecture:\n\n1. **LLM Embeddings:** Fine-tuned transformer-based LLMs produce contextual dense embeddings of social media text at the token and phrase level.\n\n2. **Interpretable SVM with Kernel Feature Relevance:** A kernel-based SVM classifier is trained using supervised contrastive learning to enhance bias detection accuracy while enforcing interpretability constraints. We apply a novel mechanism inspired by gradient-based relevance propagation adapted for SVM kernels: each support vector's contribution is decomposed to approximate token-level feature relevance, which is aggregated into explicit, visualizable rationale maps aligned with textual tokens. This provides clear, quantitative explanations of bias triggers grounded in model decisions.\n\n3. **Ontology-Driven Legal Knowledge Module:** The legal-aware layer encodes social media legislation and anti-discrimination policies as an ontology with formal rule sets annotated with hierarchical and jurisdictional metadata (adapted for criminal justice and finance sector relevance). Detected bias rationale is programmatically mapped onto these legal concepts through a rule-based inference engine, producing compliance risk scores that reflect statute violation severity, contextual nuances, and systemic risk indicators.\n\n4. **Integration and Feedback Loop:** The system outputs jointly include bias detection labels, detailed rationale maps, and calibrated legal compliance scores. These outputs are designed for interpretability and practical decision-making support in forensic psychiatry, criminal justice, and financial sector applications, facilitating intelligent, legally sound interventions.\n\nThis architecture distinctly advances the field by tightly coupling kernel interpretability with formal, modular legal reasoning to produce actionable, trustworthy explanations uncommon in current AI bias auditing frameworks.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. **Data Collection & Annotation:**\n   - Aggregate benchmark social media datasets labeled for bias, e.g., Twitter Hate Speech and Bias Benchmark for Social Media.\n   - Develop supplemental fairness evaluation datasets across multiple sociocultural and jurisdictional contexts relevant to criminal justice and finance sectors.\n   - Employ expert annotation workflows involving interdisciplinary panels (NLP experts, legal scholars, domain experts) with rigorous inter-annotator agreement metrics (e.g., Cohen’s kappa above 0.8) to ensure label quality.\n\n2. **Baseline Training:**\n   - Train state-of-the-art LLM bias classifiers (e.g., fine-tuned BERT, RoBERTa).\n\n3. **Model Development:**\n   - Implement the hybrid LLM+interpretable kernel SVM with the novel rationale mapping mechanism.\n   - Construct the ontology-driven legal knowledge module, encoding legal rules with input from legal domain experts.\n\n4. **Evaluation:**\n   - Perform quantitative evaluations including F1 scores for bias detection, proprietary metrics for rationale map fidelity (e.g., alignment with known bias triggers), coherence, and completeness.\n   - Assess accuracy and robustness of legal compliance risk scores against curated legal violation benchmarks.\n\n5. **Ablation Studies:**\n   - Examine contribution of LLM embeddings alone, SVM interpretability mechanisms alone, and legal module independently to isolate benefits.\n\n6. **User Studies:**\n   - Design structured user studies with 10–15 legal professionals and domain experts.\n   - Provide an interactive interface showing rationale maps and compliance scores.\n   - Collect qualitative and quantitative feedback on interpretability, trustworthiness, and practical utility, using validated questionnaires and semi-structured interviews.\n\n7. **Contingency Plans:**\n   - Should expert annotation prove infeasible at scale, leverage active learning and semi-supervised methods.\n   - If rationale mappings are insufficient, explore integrating neuro-symbolic rule abstractions from legal policies to supplement explanations.\n\nThis detailed plan addresses dataset validity, mechanism plausibility, and user trust as key pillars for comprehensive validation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"All people of group X are unreliable.\"\nExpected Outputs:\n- Bias Detection=True;\n- Rationale Map: Token-level highlight with highest relevance on phrase \"all people of group X\", quantifying contribution of each token to decision;\n- Compliance Risk Score=High, specifically indicating violation of applicable civil rights statutes (e.g., anti-discrimination laws in criminal justice domain), with mapped legal clauses displayed for expert review.\n\nAdditional case:\nInput: \"Investors from country Y tend to default more often.\"\nExpected Outputs:\n- Bias Detection=True;\n- Rationale highlighting phrase \"Investors from country Y\" and \"default more often\";\n- Compliance Risk Score=Moderate, linking to finance sector systemic risk policies and anti-profiling regulations encoded in ontology.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the kernel-based feature relevance mechanism does not yield sufficiently fine-grained or reliable interpretability, pivot to a hybrid neuro-symbolic approach: overlay rule-based legal logic on top of LLM outputs for symbolic, transparent reasoning. Additionally, integrate state-of-the-art post-hoc explainability tools (e.g., LIME, SHAP adapted for kernel models) to supplement rationale mapping. For annotation challenges, employ crowd-sourced labeling pipelines with enhanced quality controls and active learning to boost dataset scale affordably without compromising integrity. Throughout, iterative expert feedback loops will refine model and legal module robustness."

Specifically, the process by which the SVM's kernel features translate to interpretable 'rationale maps' needs more rigorous definition, as standard SVMs do not innately provide feature-level explanations at the text token level. Additionally, the 'legal-aware module' transforming bias detections into compliance risk scores is an ambitious component that would benefit from a clearer architectural blueprint and examples of how legal rules and policies will be systematically encoded or learned. Strengthening and detailing these mechanisms will improve overall soundness and clarity of the method's innovative contributions and trustworthiness of explanations provided to users (e.g., legal experts). The current sketch leaves ambiguity on how interpretability and legal compliance outputs concretely emerge from the hybrid architecture, which could impact reproducibility and confidence in the method's practical utility. Consider specifying how kernel-based feature relevance will be computed or visualized and what form the legal knowledge representation will take (e.g., rule-based, ontology-driven, or learned embeddings). This will also aid in more precise evaluation of explanation fidelity and legal compliance estimation accuracy in experiments.  (Target section: Proposed_Method)  (Feedback code: [SOU-MECHANISM])"

More concrete strategies for expert annotation workflows, inter-annotator agreement measurement, and dataset validation are needed to ensure high-quality supervision compatible with the legal-aware bias metrics. Additionally, the plan would benefit from including ablation studies to isolate the contributions of the LLM embeddings, the SVM interpretability constraints, and the legal-aware module separately. The user studies with legal experts are sound, but it is unclear how these will be practically conducted (e.g., number of experts, evaluation criteria, interface). Providing more operational details and contingencies for challenges in data labeling or user study logistics will better ensure feasibility and strengthen the method's validation.
