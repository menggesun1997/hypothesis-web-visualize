However, the increased computational complexity, stemming primarily from the self-attention mechanism, parallels the manner in which convolution operations constrain the capabilities and speed of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The self-attention algorithm, specifically the matrix-matrix multiplication (MatMul) operations, demands a substantial amount of memory and computational complexity, thereby restricting the overall performance of the transformer. This paper introduces an efficient hardware accelerator for the transformer network, leveraging memristor-based in-memory computing. The design targets the memory bottleneck associated with MatMul operations in the self-attention process, utilizing approximate analog computation and the highly parallel computations facilitated by the memristor crossbar architecture. Remarkably, this approach resulted in a reduction of approximately 10 times in the number of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations in transformer networks, while maintaining 95.47% accuracy for the MNIST dataset, as validated by a comprehensive circuit simulator employing NeuroSim 3.0. Simulation outcomes indicate an area utilization of 6895.7 μm2$$\\\\mu m^2$$, a latency of 15.52 seconds, an energy consumption of 3 mJ, and a leakage power of 59.55 μW$$\\\\mu W$$. The methodology outlined in this paper represents a substantial stride towards a hardware-friendly transformer architecture for edge devices, poised to achieve real-time performance.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Open challenges and opportunities in federated foundation models towards biomedical healthcare', 'abstract': 'This survey explores the transformative impact of foundation models (FMs) in artificial intelligence, focusing on their integration with federated learning (FL) in biomedical research. Foundation models such as ChatGPT, LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and multimodal patient interactions. The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges, and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs and FL, laying the groundwork for healthcare innovations.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'CMTNet: a hybrid CNN-transformer network for UAV-based hyperspectral crop classification in precision agriculture', 'abstract': 'Hyperspectral imaging acquired from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers detailed spectral and spatial data that holds transformative potential for precision agriculture applications, such as crop classification, health monitoring, and yield estimation. However, traditional methods struggle to effectively capture both local and global features, particularly in complex agricultural environments with diverse crop types, varying growth stages, and imbalanced data distributions. To address these challenges, we propose CMTNet, an innovative deep learning framework that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers for hyperspectral crop classification. The model combines a spectral-spatial feature extraction module to capture shallow features, a dual-branch architecture that extracts both local and global features simultaneously, and a multi-output constraint module to enhance classification accuracy through cross-constraints among multiple feature levels. Extensive experiments were conducted on three UAV-acquired datasets: WHU-Hi-LongKou, WHU-Hi-HanChuan, and WHU-Hi-HongHu. The experimental results demonstrate that CMTNet achieved overall accuracy (OA) values of 99.58%, 97.29%, and 98.31% on these three datasets, surpassing the current state-of-the-art method (CTMixer) by 0.19% (LongKou), 1.75% (HanChuan), and 2.52% (HongHu) in OA values, respectively. These findings indicate its superior potential for UAV-based agricultural monitoring in complex environments. These results advance the precision and reliability of hyperspectral crop classification, offering a valuable solution for precision agriculture challenges.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.
