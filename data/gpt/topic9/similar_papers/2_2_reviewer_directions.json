    "title": "Domain-Specific Large Language Model Framework for Ophthalmology Conversational AI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current medical chatbots lack access to up-to-date, high-quality domain-specific datasets, limiting clinical validity and accuracy in specialized fields like ophthalmology.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gap (2) data limitations and external gap (c) leveraging cross-disciplinary collaboration with institutions such as National University of Singapore to create domain-specific grounded datasets enhancing evaluation frameworks for precision diagnostic dialogues.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a large-scale ophthalmology conversational dataset by collaborating with academic health centers for real patient-clinician dialogues, imaging annotations, and diagnostic reports. Fine-tune a pretrained LLM specifically on this dataset, incorporating multimodal inputs (text plus retina images). Create a specialized evaluation benchmark combining clinical accuracy, diagnostic concordance, and user comprehension. Integrate knowledge graph representations of ophthalmic concepts to improve reasoning and fact consistency during conversations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Acquisition: Collect annotated transcripts and paired retinal imaging data from collaborating centers. 2. LLM Fine-Tuning: Use domain-adaptive training on the enriched dataset, including multimodal fusion layers. 3. Benchmark Creation: Develop a new ophthalmology conversational evaluation with clinician-in-the-loop validations. 4. Comparative Analysis: Measure against generic medical chatbots on diagnostic accuracy, user satisfaction, and error rates.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient: \"I've noticed blurred vision and floaters recently.\" Supporting input: Retina scan images attached. Output: \"Based on your symptoms and retinal scan, you might be experiencing early signs of diabetic retinopathy. I recommend a detailed consultation with your ophthalmologist promptly.\" Expected: Domain-specific, multimodal clinically accurate advice improving early detection.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal fusion is technically challenging, fallback to text-only fine-tuning with image summary metadata. If dataset scale is insufficient, use data augmentation via synthetic clinical scenarios and image synthesis."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan hinges critically on acquiring sufficiently large and high-quality multimodal datasets (annotated dialogue transcripts paired with retinal images) from multiple academic health centers, which is known to be notoriously difficult due to privacy regulations, data heterogeneity, and annotation costs. The plan would benefit from a more detailed risk assessment and mitigation strategies beyond the fallback to synthetic data, such as developing standardized data-sharing protocols, leveraging federated learning to preserve privacy, or incremental pilot studies to validate data acquisition feasibility before large-scale fine-tuning. Additionally, the multimodal fusion approach, while promising, is technically complex and requires clear architectural design choices and validation steps to ensure effective integration of textual and imaging data. Strengthening the experimental plan with these practical considerations and phased milestones will enhance feasibility confidence and scientific rigor in execution planning. The current plan feels optimistic without sufficient contingency breakdowns related to dataset acquisition and multimodal modeling complexities, which may impact project deliverability and timeline estimation substantially if not addressed early on. Targeting Experiment_Plan section explicitly for elaboration and risk mitigation would improve clarity and feasibility assessments substantially.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screened novelty rating of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the specialized focus on ophthalmology conversational AI, the proposal could significantly increase its impact and novelty by integrating insights from broader cognitive and symbolic reasoning fields, specifically drawing from related Globally-Linked Concepts such as 'cognitive evolution', 'AI systems', and 'symbolic material culture'. For instance, incorporating symbolic reasoning frameworks or evolutionary-inspired cognitive modeling to enhance the knowledge graph or reasoning modules within the conversational AI could improve its capability for explainable diagnostics and richer interaction beyond pattern matching. This cross-disciplinary integration could open avenues for more generalized clinical AI systems with interpretable, culturally-aware medical dialogue, thus broadening its novelty and relevance beyond current clinical NLP benchmarks. Embedding this approach explicitly in the Proposed_Method and Evaluation could elevate both scientific impact and differentiate the contribution within a crowded competitive space. Recommend the authors explore collaborations with cognitive scientists or incorporate symbolic AI advances aligned with human cognitive evolution theories to strengthen novelty and practical utility in real-world medical decision support systems."
