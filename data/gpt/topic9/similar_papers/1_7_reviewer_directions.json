    "title": "Neuro-Symbolic Prompt Injection with Logical Constraints for Explainable Low-Resource NLP",
    "Problem_Statement": "Prompt tuning approaches lack explicit integration with logical rules, reducing interpretability and robustness in low-resource language understanding.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap regarding the absence of interpretable models and logic-based reasoning integration in prompt tuning, advancing Opportunity 3’s vision of explainable logic modules combined with modern tuning.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a neuro-symbolic prompt injection framework where logic constraints are encoded as symbolic prompts combined with continuous learned prompts. The logic prompts explicitly encode domain-specific rules (e.g., factual consistency) and interact with the model’s reasoning layers. The model is trained to output predictions consistent both with data and symbolic logic, enabling explainability and improved robustness in few-shot scenarios for low-resource NLP tasks.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Define domain logic rules for misinformation and stance detection in target languages. 2) Encode these rules as discrete prompts injected into transformer layers. 3) Pretrain foundation models with combined symbolic and learned prompts. 4) Evaluate interpretability via probing methods and task accuracy. 5) Compare to purely continuous prompt tuning and logic-only baselines. 6) Metrics include task F1, logical consistency, and explanation fidelity.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Text claim with injected logic prompt enforcing fact-checking consistency. Expected output: Model predicts misinformation labels following injected rules with accompanying human-interpretable explanations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If symbolic prompts interfere with multitask learning, relax constraints using fuzzy logic or implement progressive logic injection schedules that increase constraints over training."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes combining symbolic logic constraints as discrete prompts with continuous learned prompts injected into transformer layers. However, details on how these symbolic prompts will concretely interface, interact, or be integrated into the transformer’s reasoning layers are missing or vague. It is critical to clarify the mechanism by which logical rules are represented, injected, and influence model computations without disrupting pretrained behaviors. Consider specifying the representation of symbolic prompts, their injection points, and how the model jointly optimizes to satisfy both data and logic constraints, to ensure soundness and reproducibility of the approach, especially given the complexity of neuro-symbolic integration in transformers for low-resource NLP scenarios. This clarity will strengthen confidence in the feasibility and impact of the method."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a rigorous approach but lacks consideration of potential dataset limitations and computational resource requirements inherent to training foundation models with combined symbolic and learned prompts, particularly in low-resource languages. More concretely, steps such as pretraining foundation models with symbolic prompts may require specialized datasets and significant compute not clearly addressed. It is recommended to elaborate on how domain logic rules will be crafted reliably for multiple target languages, the expected scale of foundation models used, and practical fallback or resource-saving strategies beyond the fallback plan. Including small-scale pilot studies or ablations as initial experiments would also improve feasibility assessment and mitigate risks before full-scale training."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty rating of NOV-COMPETITIVE, the proposal could be strengthened by explicitly integrating concepts from 'domain knowledge of experts' and 'machine reasoning' within neuro-symbolic frameworks. For example, incorporating structured knowledge sources or expert-curated ontologies as part of the symbolic prompt design could deepen semantics and enhance explainability. Additionally, leveraging recent advances in 'neural language models' that support flexible prompt tuning or adapter modules might allow smoother integration of discrete logic constraints. Further linking the approach with broader 'natural language processing research' on semantic interoperability could amplify impact and carve a clearer niche within the state-of-the-art hybrid approaches in neuro-symbolic AI."
