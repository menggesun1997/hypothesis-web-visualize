    "title": "Responsible AI Legal Framework Generator for Social Media LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing AI deployment in social media lacks integrated legal compliance frameworks that embed civil rights and privacy laws into generative LLM design, resulting in potential legal and ethical risks.",
    "Motivation": "Leverages the global hidden bridge between AI development directions and legal frameworks to propose an adaptive, responsible AI legal framework generator tailored for social media contexts that enforce privacy and fairness inherently, filling a major external gap.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an automated framework generation system that ingests legal statutes, privacy policies, and civil rights regulations, and outputs formalized constraints and guidelines embedded into model architectures and deployment pipelines via declarative policies. This includes automated legal judgment prediction models to assess compliance risk of LLM-generated content in social media. The system supports developers with actionable, law-driven checkpoints and adaptive mitigation strategies.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect comprehensive US and international social media privacy and civil rights legal documents. 2. Build a database with semantic annotations. 3. Train NLP models for legal judgment prediction using curated datasets of legal cases related to social media. 4. Integrate these into an AI framework generation tool using constrained optimization to induce compliance rules into LLM token generation pipelines. 5. Validate compliance enforcement effectiveness in simulated deployment scenarios.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Proposed generative response potentially containing discriminatory content. Output: Model flags violation under legal constraints with recommended redactions or rephrasing to meet privacy and civil rights standards.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "Should direct legal text-to-constraint mapping prove noisy, use human-in-the-loop semi-automated curation of frameworks. Alternatively, focus on a narrower subset of laws for initial prototyping."
