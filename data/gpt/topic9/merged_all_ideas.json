        "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource language generation models often overlook critical sociocultural, interpersonal, and pragmatic contexts, limiting the relevance, emotional resonance, and engagement of generated text, especially for languages with complex, underrepresented grammar and culturally nuanced communicative styles. Existing approaches insufficiently integrate social-psychological dimensions and figurative language processing crucial for authentic, culturally competent generation in these contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Beyond mere linguistic correctness, low-resource language models must address sociocultural pragmatics informed by social psychology, interpersonal communication, and applied linguistics research to enable nuanced, contextually appropriate generation. Incorporating knowledge graphs alone is insufficient; integrating dynamic, theory-driven social/pragmatic variables and figurative language understanding will fill key gaps in current research. This approach leverages interdisciplinary insights from the Routledge Handbook on Language Learning and Second Language Acquisition to ensure fine-grained adaptation to learner individual differences, cultural norms, and figurative expressions, elevating model impact and novelty in a competitive field.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a multilingual language model architecture that integrates: (1) extended external domain- and culture-specific knowledge graphs capturing sociocultural facts and norms; (2) theory-informed embeddings of social dimensions from social psychology and interpersonal communication (e.g., power distance, politeness strategies, learner individual differences); (3) figurative language processing modules informed by applied linguistics research to handle sarcasm, idioms, and style transfer effectively; and (4) affective computing modules detecting emotion and sarcasm as conditioning signals. A hierarchical latent variable framework will fuse these heterogeneous contexts with linguistic generation. Linguistically specialized embeddings will capture complex grammatical features of Bangla, Sinhala, and other Indo-Aryan languages. Collaboration with social scientists and linguists will ensure principled modeling. This interdisciplinary integration and explicit modeling of interpersonal pragmatics and figurative language distinguish the approach from existing methods.",

Iterative updates will leverage quantitative metrics and qualitative human assessments, documented in reproducible protocols.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt in Sinhala requesting an empathetic, culturally sensitive response to a user's story of loss that includes subtle irony. Expected Output: Generated text exhibits not only appropriate emotional tone and idiomatic expressions consistent with Sinhala culture and grammatical nuances but also correctly interprets and processes figurative language to respond with culturally competent empathy, demonstrating understanding of interpersonal politeness and social norms.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Explicit fallback criteria involve quantitative plateauing of pragmatic correctness metrics and negative user feedback trends documented during iterative training. Upon triggering fallback, models will rely on refined latent variable architectures conditioning on social and affective embeddings without explicit knowledge graph input.

        "Motivation": "Existing approaches insufficiently integrate morphosyntactic knowledge explicitly during decoding in generation tasks, often relying on implicit or multitask objectives which limit robustness and interpretability. We propose a clearly formulated morphosyntactic-aware noisy channel framework that jointly models morphological and syntactic units’ generation and recognition probabilities within transformer-based architectures. By formally integrating unsupervised morphological tagging and cross-lingual syntactic parsing informed by part-of-speech tagging and natural language understanding concepts, this approach advances beyond prior work by explicitly combining noisy channel modeling with end-to-end neural generation, promising improved morphosyntactic consistency and reduced hallucinations in low-resource, morphologically complex languages like Urdu and Bangla.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We design a probabilistic noisy channel model where the target sentence’s morphosyntactic structure is modeled using joint morphological and syntactic units, formalized as follows: For input sequence x and output sequence y with latent morphosyntactic annotation m, we decompose p(y|x) ∝ p(x|y,m) p(y,m). The channel model p(x|y,m) captures recognition probabilities, while the source model p(y,m) encodes generation likelihood including morphosyntactic priors. Specifically, m combines unsupervised morphological tags and syntactic parses obtained via cross-lingual transfer learning from related high-resource languages, incorporating POS tagging and syntactic role information for natural language understanding. We integrate this noisy channel framework within an end-to-end transformer sequence-to-sequence model by defining composite loss terms: a standard generation loss; a morphological consistency loss enforcing agreement with predicted m (using pointer networks for morphology alignment); and a syntactic coherence loss based on constituency and dependency parses. Model architecture diagrams illustrate interaction: the transformer decoder produces hypotheses scored jointly with morphosyntactic priors during beam search, allowing joint optimization with reinforcement learning-style policy gradients on morphosyntactic consistency metrics. Algorithmic steps explicitly detail training, inference with beam reranking using noisy channel scores, and joint backpropagation schemes. This method transparently balances decoder fluency and morphosyntactic integrity, addressing hallucination in low-resource morphologically rich languages more effectively and with novel integration of morphosyntactic noisy channel modeling and explicit unsupervised tagging.",

This comprehensive approach not only tackles the scarcity and cultural variability of affective data but also significantly elevates the novelty and real-world impact beyond current cross-lingual pipelines, aligning with global benchmarks and responsible AI practices.",

Our approach leverages few-shot learning paradigms using meta-learned adapters to effectively adapt emotion and sarcasm detection to low-resource languages with limited annotations. A gating fusion mechanism adaptively integrates affective and linguistic streams, conditioned by contextual embeddings and auxiliary signals from opinion mining on target language social media discourse to enhance cultural alignment. Furthermore, the model incorporates modules for offensive language and fake news detection to ensure dialogue safety and relevance in sensitive contexts. We implement iterative human-in-the-loop validation and transfer diagnostic protocols at multiple transfer stages, measuring metric-separated transfer effectiveness (e.g., transfer gain over base detection accuracy) and cultural affect nuance handling, to refine transfer robustness and fusion integration.

The few-shot approach enables learning from high-resource language error patterns while transferring effectively to low-resource languages with minimal supervision.\n\n2. **Human-Annotated Signal Integration:** We gather limited human evaluation signals (fluency, relevance, faithfulness) via crowd-sourcing in target low-resource languages, employing calibrated annotation protocols. This human feedback is embedded as auxiliary supervision during meta-metric training, encouraging alignment with human judgment.\n\n3. **Multimodal Feature Fusion:** To enhance robustness and domain generalization, we incorporate multimodal input signals (e.g., audiovisual features from news videos, speech summaries) by integrating visual and acoustic embeddings with textual features via a multimodal transformer backbone, capturing complementary semantic cues unavailable to text-only metrics.\n\n4. **Learned Meta-Evaluation Metric:** We design a unified transformer-based meta-evaluation network that fuses lexical similarity scores (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU), semantic embedding similarities (using multilingual BERT variants), noisy channel error probability estimates, human evaluation embeddings, and multimodal features through cross-attention layers. The model is trained with a regression objective to predict human judgment scores, optimizing for correlation metrics such as Kendall’s Tau and Pearson correlation.\n\n5. **Component Contribution and Ablation Analysis:** To ensure methodological rigor, we quantify the independent and joint effects of each component (noisy channel estimates, human signals, multimodal features) on correlation improvements via controlled ablation studies and normalized attribution techniques. Transparent mathematical formulas describe each fusion step and loss term to support reproducibility.\n\nThis approach innovatively combines few-shot prompt-tuning for low-resource adaptation, multimodal embedding fusion, and learned error modeling into a coherent human-aligned evaluation metric, advancing beyond incremental improvements and setting a foundation for scalable, accurate summarization evaluation across diverse low-resource conditions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Aggregate a multilingual, multimodal summarization evaluation dataset, including low-resource languages (e.g., Marathi, Swahili), enriched with human judgment annotations across relevance, fluency, and faithfulness, collected via calibrated crowd-sourcing.\n2) Develop noisy channel models for typical summarization errors by adapting pretrained multilingual transformers with prompt-tuning and adapter modules under few-shot learning settings; validate adaptation quality on high-resource languages before transfer.\n3) Extract multimodal features (visual, auditory) from news video datasets aligned with text summaries; encode modalities with specialized transformer encoders and fuse with textual representations.\n4) Train the meta-evaluation metric leveraging combined lexical metrics, semantic embeddings, noisy channel outputs, human signals, and multimodal inputs; optimize for maximizing correlation with human annotations.\n5) Perform rigorous ablation studies to assess individual and synergistic contributions of each component.\n6) Benchmark against state-of-the-art metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore) across multiple languages and domains, evaluating zero-shot and few-shot generalization capabilities.\n7) Validate model robustness on novel low-resource languages and summarization types, including dialogue and speech summarization, to demonstrate broad applicability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Generated abstractive summary in Marathi for a Hindi news article video.\n- Existing metric BLEU scores summary at 0.65 while human evaluation rates correctness at 0.80.\n- Our noisy channel model predicts a moderate hallucination probability in key content fragments.\n- Multimodal embeddings capture aligned visual content coherence.\n- The learned meta-metric integrates these signals to produce a score of 0.79, closely matching human judgment by effectively down-weighting hallucinated content and rewarding factual relevance.\nAblation analysis confirms a 12% increase in correlation metrics attributable to noisy channel components and a 5% increase from multimodal integration individually, with combined synergistic improvement reaching 18%.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should noisy channel modeling via few-shot adaptation yield insufficient signal quality, we will pivot to a robust ensemble learning strategy combining solely semantic similarity metrics (e.g., multilingual BERTScore), calibrated human feedback embeddings, and multimodal features, omitting explicit error modeling. Additionally, we will experiment with unsupervised or self-supervised metric learning by synthesizing errors via perturbative data augmentation in low-resource languages to simulate typical summarization mistakes, thus enabling synthetic supervision without extensive human labels. These adaptations retain the multimodal and few-shot principles while lowering dependency on noisy channel model accuracy, ensuring a viable path toward human-aligned metric development."

        "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource languages face significant challenges in natural language understanding due to limited contextual data and sparse ground truth, leading to poor model generalization and reduced user engagement. Existing NLP approaches often neglect rich multimodal human communication cues and lack adaptive user-centered interaction mechanisms, limiting their applicability in real-world support domains such as primary healthcare and daily assistance for marginalized communities.",
        "Motivation": "To transcend current low-resource NLP limitations, this work integrates social robotics principles from socially assistive and human-robot interaction fields—particularly empathetic feedback and context-aware dialogue systems—into multimodal language platforms. By combining speech, gesture, and affective signals with intelligent decision-making, the approach creates an adaptive human-in-the-loop learning environment that evolves through user interaction. This fusion offers a novel, user-centered methodology that not only enhances language model understanding for low-resource scenarios but also supports real-world applications like empowering primary healthcare workers and daily life support, bridging technical NLP improvements with socially impactful outcomes.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular multimodal interactive platform that tightly integrates speech, gesture, and emotion recognition streams with fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) via a socially assistive robotics framework. The system architecture includes: (1) multimodal input encoders capturing speech-to-text with acoustic emotion cues, computer vision-based gesture recognition, and facial affect analysis; (2) a fusion module applying attention-based neural networks to resolve ambiguous or conflicting multimodal signals using context and historical interaction data; (3) an adaptive dialogue manager inspired by socially assistive robot architectures that generates empathetic, context-aware verbal and nonverbal feedback; (4) a human-in-the-loop active learning loop where user corrections and clarifications update model parameters incrementally through online fine-tuning with uncertainty sampling and consistency checks to handle contradictory feedback; (5) intelligent decision-making modules that utilize situational and user state information to personalize responses and engagement strategies. The platform leverages advances in cognitive and artificial neural networks to simulate biological neural functions underlying social communication. This design not only advances low-resource NLP by exploiting richer multimodal contexts but also elevates user interaction quality, making it suitable for practical deployment in care-provider and primary healthcare worker support scenarios.",

The platform interprets speech content augmented by gesture and emotion signals to disambiguate intent and delivers an empathetic, contextually precise response including verbal explanation and supportive nonverbal feedback (e.g., confirming nods or synthesized empathetic expressions). User corrects a misunderstood intent via speech or a clarifying gesture, triggering the system's online update to adapt language understanding. Expected outcomes include improved accuracy in intent recognition, enhanced user engagement, and demonstrable adaptation to ambiguous or conflicting multimodal inputs over iterative interactions.",

The human-in-the-loop feedback will be realized through text-based clarifications and annotated signal placeholders, enabling staged evaluation of the adaptive fine-tuning and dialogue management components. This fallback ensures core algorithmic validation, allowing progressive integration of real multimodal sensors as technology or resources permit."

Nodes correspond to semantic units such as concepts, predicates, and entities, from which we extract a shared vocabulary of universal semantic graph tokens (USGTs), each representing a distinct semantic concept or relation.\n\n2) Embedding Initialization and Numerical Representation: Each USGT is assigned an initial embedding vector by projecting pretrained multilingual lexical embeddings (e.g., from XLM-RoBERTa's embedding space) averaged and refined through graph neural networks capturing local graph structure context. This produces semantically meaningful and topology-aware token embeddings instead of random initialization.\n\n3) Dynamic Prompt Composition Mechanism: For multi-task prompt tuning, task-specific prompt templates dynamically select and combine USGT tokens relevant to each task's semantic needs using a learned gating mechanism conditioned on the task identity and input context embeddings.

Although integrating linguistically meaningful tokens from semantic knowledge graphs offers potential advantages, the noise, incompleteness, and limited coverage inherent in semantic resources for many low-resource languages challenge the reliability and effectiveness of such approaches. Without rigorous validation of the semantic token quality and explicit mechanisms to mitigate resource limitations and graph noise, tuning effectiveness and downstream performance remain uncertain.",

        "Problem_Statement": "Healthcare conversational agents leveraging large language models face a critical challenge: simultaneously preserving rigorous clinical accuracy while maintaining engaging, empathetic dialogue over multi-turn interactions. Existing approaches often treat these objectives independently or statically combine them, resulting in suboptimal patient trust, comprehension, and outcomes. Furthermore, lacking integration with internationally recognized health standards limits clinical relevance and personalization in domains such as nutrition, which are essential in comprehensive patient care.",
        "Motivation": "While prior research separately optimized clinical correctness or conversational engagement in AI agents, this project innovates by designing a dynamic, dual-stream reinforcement learning (RL) framework that quantitatively balances these conflicting goals in real time through a context-aware gating mechanism. Emphasizing multi-turn dialogue coherence and patient trust, this approach uniquely incorporates global domain expertise by integrating guidelines from the International Union of Nutritional Sciences within the clinical knowledge base to enrich dialogue personalization and factuality. This comprehensive, theoretically motivated framework addresses the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty gap by combining multi-objective learning, dialogue modeling, and international clinical standards for healthcare conversational agents aimed at high-stakes, sensitive settings.",

A novel, context-aware gating mechanism dynamically weights outputs from these streams per dialogue turn by quantitatively integrating real-time patient states (emotional/anxiety indicators), session history embeddings capturing multi-turn coherence, and conversational context vectors. This gating function employs a learnable parameterized model, e.g., a neural network with attention layers, explicitly trained to resolve conflicts by optimizing long-term patient trust and outcome-based composite rewards. Algorithmically, the method includes: \n- Formal definition of multi-objective RL with Pareto front approximations.\n- Use of multi-turn dialogue state representations via transformer-based encoders.\n- Integration of external structured knowledge from IUNS and other trusted bodies into reward shaping.\n- Mechanisms for identifying and mitigating failure modes such as mode collapse, unstable gating weights, or reward signal conflict through regularization and clinical oversight checkpoints.\nThis method advances beyond prior art by tightly coupling multi-turn dialogue consistency, multi-objective balance, and global expert knowledge in a transparent, reproducible manner suitable for sensitive clinical environments.",

Conduct controlled user studies measuring trade-offs, patient trust, comprehension, and outcome proxies over extended sessions.\n5. Analyze gating weights and policies to interpret decision rationale and diagnose failure modes.\n6.

Incorporate specialized metrics for mental health communication nuances (e.g., empathy, stigma-related language) and cultural sensitivity. Utilize federated learning to refine fact-checking modules without compromising patient data privacy.\n\nStep 3: Expert Review Process – Assemble multidisciplinary expert panel (e.g., clinicians, health communication specialists, patient advocates) with defined selection criteria and calibration training. Execute blinded multi-rater annotation of AI-generated outputs to establish ground truth, calculating inter-rater reliability (e.g., Cohen’s Kappa), and resolving disagreements through consensus.\n\nStep 4: Framework Benchmarking and Validation – Compare automated composite scores against expert ratings to assess precision, recall, and overall concordance.

        "Problem_Statement": "Current legal AI explanation systems generally fail to integrate hierarchical legal ontologies effectively within language models, resulting in explanations that are neither semantically grounded nor fully compliant with legal interpretability norms. This limits domain-aware interpretability and undermines the trustworthiness of critical legal decision support tools.",
        "Motivation": "While existing approaches embed legal ontology information in language models, they often treat ontology integration as a post-hoc or loosely coupled step, leading to disjointed explanations that lack semantic transparency and rigorous grounding in legal norms. Addressing these limitations requires a method that tightly couples legal ontologies with transformer-based language models within the attention mechanism, ensuring explanations are both linguistically fluent and semantically anchored to ontology elements. This work advances Explainable AI in the legal domain by enabling semantically precise, law-compliant, and dynamically context-aware interpretations of textual legal inputs. Our approach moves beyond prior work by operationalizing legal interpretability norms directly in the model's reasoning pipeline and explicating the integration mechanism to ensure reproducibility and effectiveness.",

The key components include: (1) Legal Ontology Module: We construct or adapt a comprehensive legal ontology encompassing nodes (legal concepts, clauses, obligations) and their semantically rich relations, represented as a graph with hierarchical and lateral edges. Ontology elements are embedded using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) pre-trained over the ontology graph, producing dense embeddings that encapsulate legal semantics. (2) Alignment Layer: To reconcile the embedding spaces of ontology vectors and textual token embeddings, we introduce a learned cross-modal projection mechanism trained with contrastive learning on aligned legal text-ontology pairs, ensuring semantic consistency and seamless fusion. (3) Ontology-Aware Attention (OAA): Within the transformer layers, we augment standard self-attention by incorporating an additional parallel ontology attention head. This head computes attention distributions over ontology embeddings dynamically conditioned on the textual context. The outputs of the text and ontology attention heads are adaptively fused using a gating mechanism controlled by learned context-sensitive weights. This design balances competing signals from free-text tokens and ontology embeddings, preserving language understanding while injecting ontology grounding. (4) Explanation Generation Module: Explanations are generated via a decoder that explicitly references ontology nodes and relations attended to during reasoning. A pointer-generator mechanism is employed to enable the model to copy or highlight ontology terms verbatim within explanations, coupled with textual rationales grounded in legal interpretability norms operationalized as soft constraints. (5) Legal Interpretability Norms Operationalization: We formalize norms such as semantic coherence, traceability to legal concepts, and compliance with statutory definitions as differentiable loss terms that guide fine-tuning and explanation extraction.

This fusion enables semantic alignment between graph motifs and generated textual explanations by incorporating graph embeddings as additional attention keys and values, with learned alignment embeddings providing interpretability. Architectural details include embedding projection layers, cross-attention heads dedicated to graph features, and interpretability masks to trace explanation tokens back to specific graph nodes and edges. Computational efficiency considerations are addressed via hierarchical graph embedding compression and sparse attention mechanisms. The framework incorporates multimodal data fusion concepts to seamlessly combine structural graph data with textual LLM processing, enhancing both explanation fidelity and user trust.",

Another test case involves querying: \"Which contractual clauses influenced the liability determination?\" expecting explainable paths in the knowledge graph reflected in the textual output, demonstrating semantic alignment between graph and explanation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full integration of GNN embeddings into LLM attention proves computationally infeasible or degrades explanation quality, we will employ graph segmentation to isolate subgraphs corresponding to modular legal topics for localized explanation generation, reducing complexity. Additionally, preemptive application of contrastive learning on graph embeddings will be used to improve embedding robustness and separability. Simplified hybrid pipelines leveraging summary graph embeddings concatenated with textual prompts for LLMs will be benchmarked as a minimal viable product. Lastly, a detailed analysis of attention weights and explanation fidelity will guide incremental refactoring to retain interpretability without excessive computation."

        "Motivation": "While neuro-symbolic approaches exist, their integration within legal AI explanations remains underdeveloped, especially concerning rigorous alignment of probabilistic neural outputs with formal symbolic inferences and contradiction resolution. By leveraging dynamic knowledge graphs encoding statutes, case precedents, and domain ontologies combined with interpretable machine learning techniques inspired by clinical decision support systems, this work aims to build a scalable, rigorous framework that fuses data-driven insights with formal symbolic logic. This cross-paradigm hybrid approach enhances explanation transparency, fidelity, and robustness within complex legal reasoning contexts, differentiating itself from standard LLM-only or purely symbolic explanation systems and carving a novel niche in legal AI explainability.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-layered hybrid system with three core components: (1) An LLM module providing probabilistic predictions and feature attributions for legal case outcomes; (2) a dynamically updated legal knowledge graph (KG) encoding formalized statutes, case law, and legal ontologies, enabling context-aware symbolic inference; and (3) a symbolic reasoner operating over the KG to generate formal rule chains, contradiction detection, and uncertainty propagation via probabilistic logic programming. The integration architecture aligns LLM outputs and feature attributions with corresponding KG nodes and edges via a semantic mapping layer that temporally synchronizes neural predictions with symbolic proof elements. Contradiction resolution uses a conflict-aware inference engine applying principled belief revision mechanisms to reconcile inconsistent evidence across paradigms. Explanation synthesis composes joint reports combining probabilistic attributions mapped onto KG subgraphs with explicit symbolic proof paths, visualized with an interactive interface borrowing visualization paradigms from clinical decision support systems to facilitate stakeholder scrutiny. Evaluation will employ domain-adapted fidelity metrics measuring explanation correctness against ground truth legal reasoning, supplemented by human interpretability assessments. We will illustrate the workflow through a detailed mapping example tracing LLM-generated factors (e.g., 'breach of contract') onto explicit legal rule chains in the knowledge graph with quantitative uncertainty propagation, showcasing robust explanatory behavior on edge cases highlighting contradictions and ambiguity resolution.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Formalize a comprehensive legal knowledge graph integrating statutes, case precedents, and legal ontologies relevant to target legal domain; 2. Develop semantic mapping layers aligning LLM probabilistic outputs and attributions to KG entities and relations; 3. Implement symbolic reasoner with conflict-aware probabilistic logic programming enabling uncertainty propagation and contradiction resolution; 4. Integrate pipeline and generate hybrid composite explanations on curated benchmark legal cases featuring common and edge causal patterns; 5. Design and conduct user studies with legal professionals assessing explanation fidelity, trustworthiness, and usability leveraging insights from clinical decision support evaluation paradigms; 6. Benchmark hybrid method against LLM-only and symbolic-only explanation baselines using quantitative fidelity metrics and qualitative feedback; 7. Perform robustness tests demonstrating contradiction handling and uncertainty quantification effectiveness within hybrid explanations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM predicts outcome of contractual dispute case with probabilistic confidence scores; through semantic mapping, key attributions like 'absence of signature' and 'implied duty breach' are linked to corresponding nodes in dynamic legal knowledge graph. Symbolic reasoner generates formal proof chain applying contract law rules, identifies contradictory evidence from precedent nodes, and applies belief revision to optimize explanations. Output: Composite explanation report combines quantified probabilistic factors overlaid on KG subgraphs and explicit symbolic derivation chains visualized in an interactive interface modeled on clinical decision support visualization best practices. Expected: Explanations offer enhanced clarity, measurable fidelity to legal reasoning, robust contradiction resolution, and increased stakeholder trust demonstrated in expert user studies.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If integration of the dynamic knowledge graph and probabilistic symbolic reasoner presents scalability or brittleness challenges, fallback mechanisms include: (a) approximation through advanced post-hoc rule extraction techniques by mining LLM attention and attribution patterns to induce surrogate symbolic rules; (b) employing interpretable machine learning models inspired by healthcare decision support to produce context-aware explanations, maintaining a partial neuro-symbolic layer to preserve transparency and user trust while simplifying implementation complexity."

        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset Collection & Annotation: Source diverse multilingual legal corpora spanning multiple jurisdictions focusing on contract law, privacy regulations, and decision-making texts. Establish annotation protocols to label cultural, jurisdictional, legal decision-making, and GDPR-relevant features. Use multiple expert legal annotators from different cultures and jurisdictions to ensure high inter-annotator agreement; measure and report Cohen's kappa and other reliability metrics. 2. Synthetic Data & Crowdsourcing Augmentation: Address data scarcity and imbalance by generating synthetic legal texts using LLMs conditioned on cultural and regulatory parameters and crowdsourcing annotations validated by legal experts. 3. Model Training: Fine-tune multilingual LLMs with cultural-regulatory embeddings integrating legal decision-making process elements and GDPR indicators. 4.

Customer Feedback Loop Integration: Deploy prototypes to legal professionals across cultures, collecting structured feedback on explanation clarity, cultural relevance, regulatory compliance, and trust aspects using standardized survey instruments and interaction logs. Use feedback in active learning loops to progressively refine explanation models. 6. Validation & Benchmarking: Evaluate explanations using both automated metrics (e.g., BLEU with regulatory compliance tags, trust proxy scores) and qualitative assessments by native legal experts measuring explanation appropriateness, legal decision relevance, and GDPR clarity. Compare results against monolingual, culture-agnostic, and regulation-unaware baselines. 7. Fallback & Robustness Strategies: In scenarios of insufficient annotated data or imbalance, rely on rule-based style transfer enriched with manually curated glossaries, and incorporate ontology-driven regulatory compliance checks. Explicitly report fallback triggers and impact on performance.",

These explanations often lack personalization, interpretability, and modality diversity, resulting in limited trust and usability in critical decision-making workflows.",
        "Motivation": "While explanation systems for AI have advanced, the legal domain remains underserved by adaptive, user-centered methods that evolve dynamically according to stakeholder feedback. Despite the competitive landscape in Explainable AI (XAI), this research uniquely bridges legal AI with established clinical decision support paradigms, integrating human-centered design principles and multimodal data fusion approaches. By leveraging cross-domain insights from clinical AI systems known for their interpretability and trustworthiness, this work pushes beyond existing static or unidimensional approaches, proposing a robust framework for personalized, multimodal explanation adaptation that enhances both user trust and task effectiveness. This addresses the noted gap in stable, causally interpretable adaptation mechanisms and modality coordination for sensitive high-stakes environments.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel adaptive explanation system for legal judges that incorporates: (1) a quantitative feedback modeling framework in which judges' subjective inputs on clarity, relevance, and sufficiency are captured via structured, multimodal annotations combining Likert-scale ratings, clickstream analytics, and natural language comments; (2) a customized Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) mechanism augmented with causal inference techniques to disentangle and stabilize the impact of heterogeneous feedback on explanation generation policies, explicitly modeling user interaction history and uncertainty; (3) a multimodal explanation delivery module dynamically integrating textual summaries, visual aids (e.g., flowcharts), and semantic highlights, coordinated using a data fusion method inspired by clinical decision support systems to prevent modality conflicts and optimize interpretability within workflow constraints; (4) iterative co-design cycles with legal experts to refine interface usability and explanation modalities, leveraging human-centered design principles from clinical AI to enhance acceptance. The system employs Transformer-based architectures fine-tuned via this advanced RLHF setup, enabling real-time personalized adaptation of explanation granularity and modality blend based on stable feedback integration.",

These rules act as hard constraints applied during and after summary generation in two steps: first, the Summarization Module generates candidate summaries under soft guided control influenced by feedback from the Ethical Governance Module using constrained decoding strategies; second, the Ethical Governance Module performs automated filtering and flags violations, prompting iterative refinement with human-in-the-loop override if needed. Explanation feedback loops inform summary revision and ethical compliance verification iteratively within a unified pipeline.

This module applies rule-based and learned fuzzy inference to detect anomalies indicative of adversarial manipulation, explicitly balancing sensitivity and false alarms via user-specific thresholds inspired by security management principles. (3) Employing a transfer learning technique to adapt the detector over time across diverse legal subdomains and text corpora, learning evolving explanation distributions and gradually refining the threat model. We formalize a threat model encompassing linguistic adversarial perturbations causing undetected semantic shifts in explanations, leveraging extensive analysis of SHAP attribution distributions under benign and adversarial inputs to define detection boundaries.

Our work addresses the competitive and evolving explainability landscape by proposing a novel, theoretically grounded hierarchical SHAP approximation tailored to legal texts, combining advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) and domain-specific parsing. This approach ensures computational gains while providing formal bounds on approximation error, filling a critical niche where state-of-the-art XAI fails to scale or provide sufficient fidelity in legal NLP. By integrating black-box model interpretability techniques and leveraging document structure, our method aims to significantly advance explainability robustness and human-computer interaction in legal AI systems.",

We map these nodes into a graph representation capturing semantic and structural dependencies, then utilize a novel graph neural network trained to predict exact or near-exact Shapley values at coarse granularity, guided by localized perturbation sampling. The GNN architecture incorporates inductive biases from both legal document syntax and semantics, and learns an efficient surrogate model approximating Shapley value computations. We formally define the mapping between the GNN outputs and SHAP values, proving error bounds under assumptions of node independence and local perturbation effects, ensuring fidelity and unbiasedness in explanations. To validate theoretical claims, we conduct ablation studies comparing our GNN-based method to simpler heuristics (e.g., heuristic aggregations and sampling-based estimations), showing superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Additionally, we integrate adversarial robustness analyses inspired by cybersecurity XAI to assess stability of explanations against document perturbations. This constitutes a fundamental advancement over existing SHAP approaches which treat documents as flat texts and do not leverage GNNs with theoretical guarantees, elevating interpretability without incurring prohibitive computational costs.",

        "Motivation": "Existing legal AI explainability approaches often treat ethical considerations conceptually without concrete operationalization or integration into explanation generation pipelines, limiting adoption and trustworthiness. This research advances beyond conceptual frameworks by developing a novel, human-centered AI ethical design framework that systematically integrates measurable moral values and legal norms within explanation algorithms. The aim is to ensure explanations are not only transparent but also demonstrably fair, privacy-preserving, and accountable, thus supporting safer adoption of AI in sensitive legal contexts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-layered mechanism embedding ethical principles directly into the explainability algorithm pipeline via the following innovations: (1) Formal ethical constraints encoded as normative filters that condition the explanation generation process to minimize biased or misleading content while maximizing interpretability; (2) A value-sensitive algorithmic model that integrates quantifiable moral values (fairness, privacy, accountability) as optimization constraints during explanation synthesis; (3) Ethical auditing modules utilizing statistical bias detection and misinformation scoring to iteratively refine explanations; (4) An interactive system interface enabling user-customizable ethical transparency levels to support human-centered AI adoption. This approach operationalizes ethics as formal, measurable criteria interwoven with explanation model components rather than as post hoc checklists, ensuring ethical embedding is actionable, adaptive, and measurable while preserving explanation clarity and user trust.",

Conduct targeted user studies to empirically identify optimal customization settings balancing transparency and usability. Additionally, incorporate adaptive learning systems to iteratively refine ethical filters based on ongoing stakeholder feedback and evolving moral values in legal AI applications.

        "Problem_Statement": "Despite the proliferation of large language models in legal document analysis, there remains a critical lack of a robust, standardized AI readiness assessment that holistically integrates explanation quality, legal compliance, ethical risk, and trustworthiness. Current approaches often treat explainability, qualitative expert insight, and multi-jurisdictional compliance as distinct axes without a coherent, unified mechanism to reconcile conflicting indicators or incorporate security-by-design principles relevant for legal AI governance. This fragmentation limits consistent adoption, comparability, and trust in AI systems deployed in sensitive legal contexts.",

Grounded in Responsible Artificial Intelligence and model risk management principles, this approach uniquely incorporates a security-by-design perspective to proactively detect and mitigate cybersecurity risks inherent in legal AI deployments. By explicitly addressing the interaction and trade-offs among diverse readiness dimensions, AIR-LB sets a new standard for trustworthy legal AI evaluation that is rigorous, transparent, and operationally feasible.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose AIR-LB as a multi-layered framework uniting quantitative metrics, qualitative legal expert reviews, and automated compliance auditing under a security-by-design architecture. \n\n1) Metric Integration: Develop a formal aggregation algorithm that assigns context-aware weights to explanation fidelity (e.g., fidelity, coverage), expert legal assessments (with calibrated inter-annotator agreement modeling), and compliance flags (automated checks against GDPR, CCPA, sector laws) to produce a composite readiness index. Conflicts are resolved via a decision-theoretic approach balancing ethical risks, legal non-compliance severity, and user trust impact.\n\n2) Security-By-Design: Incorporate advanced security methods including real-time threat detection of insecure model behaviors and data privacy leakages, embedding cognitive security principles from software development lifecycles.\n\n3) Operational Pipeline: Implement a modular workflow with phased adoption capability—ranging from automated auditing to full expert review—facilitating scalability and adoption across varying legal maturity levels.\n\n4) Transparency and Robustness: Provide an open-source prototype scoring algorithm with illustrative cases demonstrating scoring on borderline or ambiguous instances, thereby reinforcing interpretability and stakeholder trust.\n\n5) Community Engagement: Establish a dynamic public leaderboard augmented with workshops incorporating continuous stakeholder feedback for iterative refinement, enabling governance aligned with Responsible AI practices and model risk management frameworks.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Stakeholder Engagement: Partner with at least 50 diverse legal AI stakeholders across sectors and jurisdictions to define readiness criteria using structured Delphi methods, ensuring demographic, legal domain, and geographic diversity with mechanisms to incentivize participation (e.g., recognition, collaborative authorship).\n\n2) Data Curation: Assemble a benchmark dataset spanning contracts, case law, regulatory texts, and privacy-sensitive documents with rigorously anonymized data governance protocols respecting confidentiality and compliance.\n\n3) Metric Development & Validation: Formalize and validate metrics for explanation fidelity, ethical risk, and compliance coverage, including calibration of expert review protocols addressing inter-annotator agreement and bias mitigation.\n\n4) Prototype Implementation: Develop AIR-LB scoring prototype incorporating the integration algorithm and security-by-design auditing tools.\n\n5) Model Evaluation: Evaluate at least three state-of-the-art legal LLMs accessible via APIs or partnerships (including models with diverse architectures) using AIR-LB, documenting computational resource usage and reproducibility.\n\n6) Risk Assessment: Identify data access, expert availability, and scalability bottlenecks with documented mitigation strategies.\n\n7) Public Release & Workshops: Launch open leaderboard and conduct iterative workshops for feedback-driven improvements and community adoption.\n\nFallbacks: Employ synthetic datasets and crowdsourcing if expert participation or data access is constrained; modularize framework to support partial deployment.",

Expert review flags potential ethical concerns.\n- Integration algorithm resolves conflict by weighting regulatory severity and outputs a readiness score with actionable insights for improvement.\n\nThese test cases illustrate AIR-LB's robustness in managing ambiguous, borderline, and conflicting readiness signals with transparency and actionable guidance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should initial metrics lack nuance, we will: \n- Intensify adaptive feedback loops with legal practitioners via iterative workshops and apply advanced consensus-building methods to reconcile qualitative inputs.\n- Expand automated auditing using updated regulatory knowledge bases and AI-driven compliance detection tools to reduce manual load.\n- Modularize AIR-LB to ensure partial adoption; organizations can select components aligned with their maturity.\n- If data access or expert participation is limited, deploy augmented synthetic datasets and leverage incentivized crowdsourcing with rigorous quality controls.\n- Build partnerships with legal bodies and AI governance institutions to extend resource availability.\n\nThis strategy ensures that AIR-LB remains feasible, adaptable, and scalable despite unpredictable resource constraints."

DP noise calibration is managed through a unified privacy budget accounting mechanism that jointly considers training rounds and explanation queries, avoiding cumulative privacy degradation. Explanation generation extends gradient-based feature attribution methods with a mathematically defined noise injection mechanism calibrated by Rényi differential privacy accounting, balancing perturbation magnitude against explanation fidelity as measured by proposed utility metrics (e.g., local Lipschitz continuity, faithfulness scores).

Conventional transformer-based attention mechanisms deliver excellent context modeling but remain prohibitively expensive for embedded deployments. Meanwhile, purely convolutional NLP models often lack effective long-range dependency capture and explicitly integrating attention within convolutions remains an open challenge.

Unlike existing approaches that either apply vanilla self-attention at high cost or separate CNN and attention layers in inefficient stacks, we propose a rigorously defined fusion of coordinate attention — a structured, computationally light attention variant proven in vision — within convolutional kernels. Furthermore, by integrating hybrid linear bottleneck residual blocks and MLP modules, our architecture enhances multi-scale contextual feature extraction with minimal overhead, enabling novel functionality such as federated learning to handle non-IID data in IoT scenarios. This integrated and modular approach stands distinct from incremental CNN-attention combinations by concretely detailing efficient fusion mechanisms, providing transparent algorithmic descriptions, and addressing practical deployment challenges.",

These attention maps modulate convolution kernels by element-wise multiplication before convolution, effectively weighting filters dynamically per input context while preserving convolutional efficiency. \n\nTo ensure efficient implementation on embedded GPUs and DSPs, the coordinate attention computations employ low-rank bottleneck transforms with shared linear projections and group-wise convolutions, reducing complexity from O(n^2) in standard self-attention to O(n) linear operations. Residual paths connect both the coordinate attention submodules and linear bottleneck blocks to facilitate gradient flow and alleviate optimization difficulties. \n\nOur architecture stacks these attention-infused convolutional modules with hybrid linear bottleneck residual blocks and MLP blocks organized in a repeated modular encoder, enabling flexible multi-scale feature extraction from token embeddings. This design leverages insights from lightweight vision transformers and CNN literature, adapting them innovatively to NLP token sequences. \n\nFurthermore, to address diverse and non-IID data common in edge IoT deployments, our framework includes federated training protocols allowing model updates to be aggregated securely from heterogeneous devices without centralized data collection. Adaptive gating mechanisms dynamically route input through convolutional or attention pathways based on resource availability and input complexity, trading off accuracy and latency on-device. \n\nThrough these concrete algorithmic detailing, architectural diagrams, and pseudo-code (omitted here for brevity), the proposed method delivers a clearly defined, theoretically grounded, and practically viable convolution-attention fusion mechanism for edge NLP inference that advances beyond competitive prior art.",

        "Problem_Statement": "Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices for dynamic IoT settings such as wearable-based human activity recognition requires balancing real-time inference latency, adaptive contextual understanding, and constrained computational resources. While transformers dominate NLP tasks through representational richness and parallelism, their often large computational footprints impede real-time edge deployment. Moreover, temporal context modeling in streaming IoT data remains challenging, as static models fail to adapt to domain shifts from non-stationary data streams, and existing lightweight transformer variants have limited lifelong learning capability. This creates a pressing need for an architecture and learning framework that combines efficient temporal context exploitation, low-latency execution within edge resource budgets, and robust semi-supervised continual adaptation over streaming unlabeled data without catastrophic forgetting.",
        "Motivation": "This work bridges two strengths: the superior temporal sequence modeling of recurrent modules—especially in resource-constrained scenarios where model compression and streaming computation are critical—and the high-quality contextual feature extraction of transformer architectures. This hybrid approach targets Opportunity 3 by building on insights from human activity recognition datasets and advances in recurrent neural networks adapted to streaming NLP data. We emphasize robust semi-supervised continual learning inspired by rehearsal and regularization strategies shown effective in continual domain adaptation literature, addressing intrinsic model instability challenges on-device. Compared to pure transformers or temporal convolution networks used commonly in edge NLP, our design aims to balance latency, adaptability, and accuracy via architectural synergy and rigorous complexity profiling. This addresses the prevailing novelty gap by integrating complementary neural paradigms and a hardened continual learning pipeline to enable scalable, resilient edge NLP tailored for IoT environments.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid architecture integrating lightweight recurrent modules (e.g., gated recurrent units or LSTMs optimized for low FLOPs) cascaded with efficient transformer blocks adapted from state-of-the-art lightweight transformers like MobileBERT or TinyBERT. Temporal convolutional layers will be optionally incorporated to offer alternative or complementary temporal feature extraction paths conditioned on latency-performance tradeoffs. We will analytically profile computational and memory complexities to optimize architectural parameters for real-time operation within edge devices' resource envelopes. To facilitate robust adaptation on streaming unlabeled IoT NLP inputs (e.g., wearable sensor transcripts), the model will employ a semi-supervised continual learning scheme combining pseudo-labeling with regularization techniques (e.g., elastic weight consolidation) and a limited rehearsal buffer to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under domain shifts. This scheme explicitly balances update frequency and computational load to guarantee inference latency remains under 100 ms. Our training methods integrate multimodal learning concepts by linking sensor observations with transcribed textual commands to enhance robustness and feature richness. These design decisions are strongly supported by preliminary complexity analysis and literature validating recurrent architectures’ efficiency on low-power devices and rehearsal-based continual learning stability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Preparation: Construct reproducible NLP task datasets from established human activity recognition datasets (e.g., WISDM, PAMAP2) by transforming streaming wearable sensor readings into textual representations simulating command recognition scenarios using rule-based and learnable sensors-to-text converters, enabling effective NLP framing. 2) Model Development: Implement the hybrid recurrent-transformer architecture and alternate temporal convolution variants. Establish complexity profiles including FLOPs, parameter count, and memory footprints on representative edge hardware simulators (e.g., Raspberry Pi, ARM Cortex-A processors) to empirically verify latency goals. Specify hyperparameters via grid search and cross-validation on holdout sets. 3) Learning Schemes: Integrate semi-supervised continual learning with explicit update scheduling respecting computing and power budgets; detail online update mechanisms including pseudo-label confidence thresholds, rehearsal buffer size, and regularization strength. 4) Benchmarking: Compare against state-of-the-art lightweight transformers (MobileBERT, TinyBERT) and pure recurrent and temporal convolution baselines on metrics of latency (end-to-end inference + update time), accuracy (classification and adaptation over time), adaptability (robustness to domain shifts in streaming data), and computational resource usage. 5) Edge Deployment: Deploy models on actual edge devices measuring real-time performance under streaming conditions, including resource profiling (CPU/GPU utilization, power consumption). 6) Statistical Rigor & Reproducibility: Employ repeated k-fold evaluations, statistical tests to confirm significance of improvements, and open-source code with detailed documentation and data processing pipelines. 7) Fallback Triggering: Define quantitative thresholds on latency, accuracy decay, and stability for fallback to alternate architectures or learning schedules, evaluated in controlled experiments.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Continuous streaming wearable sensor data from an activity recognition scenario, converted in real-time to textual commands (e.g., \"start running\", \"stop walking\"). Expected Output: Low-latency (<100ms) classification of current contextual user command, with output accuracy improving over streaming time due to on-device continual adaptation. Additionally, robust performance under domain shifts (e.g., sensor noise, user behavior changes) without forgetting previously learned patterns, evidenced by steady accuracy and bounded latency. Test cases will vary across different device types (ARM Cortex and Raspberry Pi class) and data conditions (stable vs. shifting distributions) verifying adaptability and efficiency.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the hybrid recurrent-transformer model exhibits accuracy degradation or latency above thresholds, we will fallback to architectures utilizing lightweight attention mechanisms solely, or temporal convolutional networks, which have demonstrated competitive efficiency on edge NLP tasks. Should semi-supervised continual learning cause instability or catastrophic forgetting despite regularization, we will investigate increased rehearsal buffer sizes, more conservative online update schedules, or switch to other continual learning paradigms such as parameter isolation or generative replay adapted to resource constraints. Triggering fallback will be decided via our pre-specified quantitative evaluation criteria on latency and accuracy during on-device testing. Additionally, ablative studies will be conducted to understand the tradeoffs and guide refinement of architectural and learning designs."

Locally, devices perform knowledge distillation by extracting soft-label embeddings and intermediate representations from compressed student models. These distilled knowledge components are encoded via semantic communication modules leveraging variational autoencoders (VAE) to generate compact latent representations that capture the essential predictive information while drastically reducing communication payloads. To ensure privacy, the latent representations and soft labels are perturbed with differential privacy noise calibrated under Rényi differential privacy to preserve user data confidentiality without sacrificing model utility. The central server aggregates the noisy latent embeddings using a novel federated aggregation algorithm based on attention-weighted averaging that accounts for device heterogeneity and data distribution disparities. The aggregated global model is reconstructed by a decoder network that decodes the semantic embeddings into a refined global compressed LLM, which is redistributed to edge devices for subsequent personalized adaptation. Compression strategies involve structured pruning and quantization-aware training to optimize model capacity and computational efficiency, with rigorous analysis on compression-personalization trade-offs documented through ablation studies.

        "Problem_Statement": "The deployment of large language models on resource-constrained IoT edge devices remains infeasible due to immense computational and memory demands. While CNN-transformer hybrid architectures hold promise for NLP tasks, their adaptation and compression tailored specifically for analog in-memory memristor-based hardware lack detailed exploration. Furthermore, existing transformer attention mechanisms are multiply-accumulate intensive, posing challenges in analog implementations. There is a critical need for an end-to-end, analog-aware hybrid model design that incorporates automated architecture optimization and novel low-cost attention approximations to enable real-time, energy-efficient NLP tasks on ultra-low-power IoT edge devices.",

We provide detailed algorithmic formulations, block diagrams of the dataflow architecture, and preliminary simulation of latency and energy trade-offs. 3) Integration of neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms specialized for hardware constraints to automatically find optimal CNN-transformer layer configurations, sparsity patterns, and quantization schemes that maximize compression and energy efficiency without compromising NLP task accuracy. Additionally, we incorporate federated learning protocols to enable privacy-preserving, on-device personalization, further enhancing practical applicability.

        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language models (LLMs) analyzing social media texts often fail to accurately represent and equitably treat subtle clinical distress indicators, such as mild depression or anxiety expressions, resulting in biased sentiment analysis and unfair outcomes for vulnerable mental health subgroups. This gap stems from inadequate latent feature modeling that can differentiate clinical distress from general linguistic variance, thereby impeding fairness in AI-powered mental health assessments.",
        "Motivation": "In light of the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating, this work explicitly advances the intersection of clinical psychology, AI fairness, and legal-ethical frameworks. Our approach uniquely integrates latent clinical distress embeddings with built-in compliance to emerging legal mandates, such as the EU Artificial Intelligence Act and Digital Services Act, emphasizing policy-aware fairness evaluation. Beyond technical bias mitigation, we position the model as a tool aligned with legal duties and human rights in digital mental health, aiming to enhance public health solutions and suicide prevention efforts. This multidimensional embedding methodology fills a critical gap by enabling nuanced detection and comprehensive mitigation of bias in clinical-symptom-laden social media texts, guided by ethical and legal imperatives.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a transformer-based Clinical Latent Fairness Embedding (CLFE) module pre-trained on a curated corpus comprising clinical interview transcripts, distress-related social media posts, and annotated mental health data. The CLFE functions as an auxiliary encoder producing latent vectors capturing clinical distress features. Integration with the base LLM occurs through cross-attention fusion layers inserted at multiple intermediate transformer blocks, allowing dynamic interaction between standard linguistic representations and clinical distress embeddings. The model employs multitask fine-tuning with joint optimization objectives: (1) primary social media sentiment classification, (2) auxiliary clinical distress detection, and (3) fairness-aware regularization constrained by legal compliance metrics derived from the Artificial Intelligence Act (e.g., transparency and risk minimization criteria). Bias mitigation leverages adversarial debiasing layers guided by the clinical embeddings to disentangle distress signals from general linguistic variation, preventing confounding errors. To promote interpretability and trustworthiness, an integrated auditing mechanism outputs explainable clinical distress features aligned with public health and human rights standards, supporting diagnostic audits and suicide prevention interventions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Collection and Preprocessing: Aggregate and anonymize diverse clinical corpora, including psychiatric interview transcripts, distress-tagged social media posts, and forensic psychiatry reports, ensuring compliance with data protection laws. 2) Pre-training the CLFE: Train the auxiliary latent embedding module with self-supervised objectives and supervision on distress indicators to capture nuanced psychological states. 3) Architectural Integration: Implement cross-attention fusion layers between CLFE embeddings and LLM intermediate representations, followed by multitask fine-tuning incorporating sentiment classification, distress detection, and fairness constraints reflecting legal mandates. 4) Bias Mitigation Evaluation: Employ fairness metrics tailored for clinical subgroups (e.g., disparity in false negative rates for depression-indicative posts), analyzing mitigation effectiveness. 5) Legal and Ethical Auditing: Integrate compliance auditing aligned with the Artificial Intelligence Act and Digital Services Act, assessing adherence to transparency, accountability, and non-discrimination principles. 6) User Studies: Conduct human-computer interaction experiments with vulnerable user groups and mental health professionals to evaluate interpretability, trustworthiness, and perceived fairness of model outputs. 7) Public Health and Suicide Prevention Contextualization: Collaborate with mental health organizations to assess real-world applicability for early distress detection and health status monitoring in social media contexts.",

The model outputs an interpretable explanation mapping latent distress cues aligned with psychiatric criteria. Legal compliance scores indicating non-discriminatory processing and transparency statements accompany final predictions, suitable for auditing in public health or forensic contexts.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the CLFE pre-training or integration with cross-attention fusion layers does not yield significant fairness improvements, we will pivot to a multi-task learning framework embedded directly in the LLM backbone that jointly predicts psychological state indicators and sentiment, augmented with post-hoc adversarial debiasing steps and rule-based constraints derived from legal fairness audits. Additional user studies will be leveraged to refine interpretability and trustworthiness of outputs, ensuring alignment with mental health rights and digital health solution standards."

        "Problem_Statement": "Existing bias mitigation approaches for large language models (LLMs) typically leverage demographic or content-based features but largely overlook the nuanced and context-dependent nature of user behavioral intent, particularly in social text analysis. Inferring behavioral intent from text is inherently noisy and context-sensitive, with ambiguity and varied socio-economic backgrounds complicating reliable detection. However, integrating well-founded theoretical frameworks from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mental health support literature alongside social exchange and marketing theories offers a promising avenue to ground behavioral intent inference robustly. By systematically operationalizing and validating intent through these multi-disciplinary perspectives, bias correction can become more adaptive and personalized, especially in sensitive communication domains such as mental health and dementia care. This research proposes to rigorously examine and validate the assumption that behavioral intent, inferred through enriched psychological and social theories, can effectively enhance fairness adjustments beyond traditional demographic or content-based methods, thereby ensuring robustness in diverse real-world, noisy, and ambiguous textual contexts.",

This multidisciplinary approach not only advances interpretability and generalizability of intent inference but also enables bias mitigation tailored to nuanced psychological dimensions, extending impact into critical domains such as dementia care and mental health communication. By bridging AI fairness with intelligent decision-making frameworks grounded in well-studied human behavioral patterns, the proposed work sets a new direction for dynamic, context-aware bias correction that meaningfully improves fairness metrics across diverse social texts and sensitive domains.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a tripartite, integrative architecture: 1) Behavioral Intent Module utilizes a hybrid model combining social exchange and marketing theories with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles and mental health constructs to infer nuanced user intent and emotional states from text, trained on enriched datasets including mental health-related corpora to improve fidelity and interpretability; 2) Contextual Bias Adjustment Module dynamically modulates LLM output post-processing corrections using inferred behavioral intent and associated socio-economic and psychological attributes, leveraging attention mechanisms weighted by prediction confidence to mitigate noise and ambiguity; 3) Application and Evaluation Module applies this framework specifically to socially sensitive domains such as mental health support and dementia care communication. We incorporate datasets annotated with CBT-informed behavioral intent categories and user psychological profiles to rigorously operationalize intent and validate its contribution to fairness enhancements beyond traditional bias correction. This multidisciplinary integration differentiates our approach by embedding well-validated psychological theories and domain-specific insights into AI fairness pipelines to achieve superior, context-aware bias mitigation results.",

        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1:\nInput: Social media post expressing anxiety and ambivalence about an advertising campaign’s intention.\nOutput: The system infers anxious behavioral intent consistent with CBT frameworks, adjusts the LLM’s sentiment analysis output to prevent misclassification of negative sentiment as bias, thus preserving fair treatment of consumer attitudes.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: Caregiver’s message with nuanced expressions of frustration and confusion regarding dementia patient behavior.\nOutput: The model identifies intent reflecting caregiver stress and emotional state; bias correction module adjusts language model outputs to avoid stigmatizing or overly negative characterizations, enhancing fairness and empathy in clinical communication tools.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "In case behavioral intent prediction from enriched psychological and social frameworks is insufficiently reliable due to sparse or ambiguous data, the model will gracefully degrade to a confidence-weighted hybrid approach. This approach employs simpler categorical user segmentation based on demographic and socio-economic attributes combined with soft attention mechanisms modulated by prediction confidence scores, ensuring bias corrections remain robust albeit less personalized. Additionally, we will explore transfer learning from richly annotated mental health datasets to improve intent inference and fallback robustness, while continuously evaluating fairness trade-offs to avoid compounding errors in bias correction pipelines."

        "title": "Cross-Domain Transfer Learning from Forensic Psychiatry for Emotion-Aware Bias Mitigation in Social Media LLMs with Generative AI Assistive Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) analyzing social media data face challenges in accurately detecting and mitigating bias influenced by nuanced emotional content due to the informal, diverse, and context-rich nature of social media language, including slang, sarcasm, and rapid shifts in emotional tone. Although forensic psychiatry offers advanced emotion recognition models trained on clinical texts capturing subtle psychological signals, their direct application to social media is limited by domain differences in language style and context. This project seeks to rigorously investigate the linguistic and emotional overlaps between forensic psychiatry transcripts and social media texts, identify transferable emotional features, and develop robust domain adaptation techniques to enable effective cross-domain transfer learning. By addressing the core assumption of emotional feature transferability and contextual adaptation upfront, this work aims to enhance bias detection in social media LLMs through validated emotion-aware modules that are both linguistically and contextually sound.",
        "Motivation": "Prior studies have not sufficiently explored leveraging forensic psychiatry’s rich emotional insight to improve bias mitigation in social media LLMs, partly due to domain gaps. Addressing these gaps by systematically validating and adapting emotional representations can unlock new dimensions of bias understanding—particularly affective-driven biases—beyond existing models. Additionally, integrating this approach within generative AI frameworks and assistive technologies geared toward social media content moderation and mental health support extends the applicability and societal impact of the research. This integrated, interdisciplinary strategy enhances novelty by blending forensic psychiatric insights with cutting-edge AI methodologies and real-world assistive applications, establishing a foundation for more responsible, nuanced, and globally relevant bias-aware AI systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "The approach unfolds in two critical stages. First, conduct a comprehensive linguistic and emotional feature analysis comparing forensic psychiatry transcripts and social media texts, leveraging domain similarity metrics and emotion embedding alignment to identify transferable emotional constructs. Develop and validate domain adaptation algorithms—such as adversarial domain adaptation and multi-modal fine-tuning—to robustly transfer emotion recognition capabilities from clinical to social media contexts, explicitly accounting for informal language phenomena like slang and sarcasm. Second, integrate the adapted emotion-aware modules within transformer-based LLMs enhanced with specialized emotion-sensitive bias mitigation layers. Further, embed this system within generative AI-driven content moderation pipelines and assistive technologies targeting mental health and support for marginalized communities online. This layered integration leverages generative AI’s ability to produce contextually aware, fair content and assist users, broadening impact and improving real-world bias mitigation efficacy. International interdisciplinary collaboration and alignment with emerging AI ethics standards will be pursued to validate and scale the approach.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Perform comparative linguistic and emotional analysis between forensic psychiatry and diverse social media datasets to quantify domain overlaps and divergences. 2) Design and experiment with domain adaptation techniques (e.g., adversarial training, multi-task learning) to transfer emotion recognition effectively, supported by quantitative evaluation of emotion recognition accuracy across domains. 3) Integrate emotion-aware modules into social media LLMs with emotion-sensitive bias mitigation layers. 4) Incorporate the enhanced LLM within prototype generative AI-based content moderation and assistive frameworks targeting mental health and marginalized community support. 5) Evaluate system performance on benchmarks for bias detection, fairness metrics, and emotion-sensitive bias mitigation compared to non-emotion-aware baselines. 6) Conduct user studies with target community stakeholders to assess assistive efficacy and societal impact. 7) Explore collaboration opportunities with international AI and health-related organizations (e.g., linking conceptually with the International Union of Nutritional Sciences via mental health AI applications) for broader translational validation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A sarcastic, emotionally charged social media post expressing subtle anger or frustration toward a marginalized group. Process: Adapted emotion-aware module identifies the layered emotional cues, including sarcasm and underlying anger, within the informal context. The integrated LLM flags affective bias amplified by these emotional signals and filters content accordingly within the generative AI moderation toolkit. Output: The system produces a moderated analysis that responsibly highlights emotional bias, reducing potentially harmful amplification, and provides assistive feedback to users or moderators for improved community standards. Additional scenario: An assistive technology application uses emotion-aware bias detection to offer sensitive mental health support resources when potentially distressing biased content is detected, increasing user well-being.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If initial domain adaptation proves insufficient due to pronounced linguistic and emotional mismatches, pivot to a hybrid semi-supervised multi-task learning paradigm that jointly trains on curated combined datasets of forensic psychiatry and social media texts. Additionally, incorporate robust contextual augmentation techniques to simulate social media informality within clinical data, enhancing adaptability. Incrementally build end-to-end fine-tuning pipelines with feedback loops from assistive technology deployments and content moderation use cases to iteratively refine emotion-aware bias mitigation in realistic, evolving environments."

Additionally, the proposal incorporates cybersecurity measures tailored to federated settings to defend against emerging attack vectors. This global integration expands scientific novelty and societal impact by bridging social media and medical domains, enabling robust, privacy-preserving, and fair multi-modal learning under realistic heterogeneity and threat conditions.",

This opacity limits trustworthiness and practical adoption in socially sensitive contexts such as forensic psychiatry, criminal justice, and financial sector discourse, where transparent and legally-informed bias auditing is crucial.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work integrates LLM embeddings with SVM classifiers for bias detection, the lack of rigorously defined interpretability mechanisms and formal legal compliance integration limits novelty and practical utility. This proposal uniquely contributes by establishing a well-defined, kernel-based feature relevance method to generate token-level rationale maps from SVM classifiers, systematically bridging them to a modular legal knowledge representation. By embedding domain-specific legal rules (e.g., civil rights statutes relevant to social media content) and smart risk estimation within an ontology-driven legal module, the framework offers a novel, transparent, and legally accountable bias auditing tool tailored for high-stakes sectors like criminal justice and finance, advancing beyond current competitive baselines.",

We apply a novel mechanism inspired by gradient-based relevance propagation adapted for SVM kernels: each support vector's contribution is decomposed to approximate token-level feature relevance, which is aggregated into explicit, visualizable rationale maps aligned with textual tokens. This provides clear, quantitative explanations of bias triggers grounded in model decisions.\n\n3. **Ontology-Driven Legal Knowledge Module:** The legal-aware layer encodes social media legislation and anti-discrimination policies as an ontology with formal rule sets annotated with hierarchical and jurisdictional metadata (adapted for criminal justice and finance sector relevance). Detected bias rationale is programmatically mapped onto these legal concepts through a rule-based inference engine, producing compliance risk scores that reflect statute violation severity, contextual nuances, and systemic risk indicators.\n\n4. **Integration and Feedback Loop:** The system outputs jointly include bias detection labels, detailed rationale maps, and calibrated legal compliance scores. These outputs are designed for interpretability and practical decision-making support in forensic psychiatry, criminal justice, and financial sector applications, facilitating intelligent, legally sound interventions.\n\nThis architecture distinctly advances the field by tightly coupling kernel interpretability with formal, modular legal reasoning to produce actionable, trustworthy explanations uncommon in current AI bias auditing frameworks.",
