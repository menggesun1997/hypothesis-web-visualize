    "title": "Knowledge-Graph-Augmented Multilingual Low-Resource Language Models with Sociocultural Context",
    "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource language generation models often neglect sociocultural and pragmatic context, limiting relevance and user engagement, especially for languages with complex, underrepresented grammar and cultural nuances.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses external gaps mentioning the missed opportunity to incorporate emotion/sarcasm detection, human-centered computing, and external knowledge integration into low-resource language generation, pushing the frontier beyond linguistic correctness to effective pragmatic communication.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Engineer a multilingual language model architecture integrating external domain- and culture-specific knowledge graphs with affective computing modules (emotion and sarcasm detectors) as conditioning signals. The model will employ a hierarchical latent variable framework to fuse sociocultural context with linguistic generation, allowing context-aware personalized outputs. Specialized grammatic feature embeddings capture complex structures in languages like Bangla and Indo-Aryan family.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct or extend existing knowledge graphs with culturally relevant nodes and relations for target languages. 2) Collect datasets annotated for emotion, sarcasm, and cultural context. 3) Pretrain and fine-tune multilingual large language model architectures enhanced with cultural and affective embeddings. 4) Evaluate on generation tasks measuring factuality, cultural appropriateness, emotional alignment, and human preference studies. 5) Compare with baseline generation ignoring these features.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt in Sinhala requesting an empathetic response to a user’s story of loss. Expected Output: Generated text reflecting culturally sensitive condolence, appropriate emotional tone, and idiomatic expressions consistent with Sinhala culture and language grammar.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If knowledge graph integration challenges arise, fallback to latent variable models conditioning only on affective and morphological embeddings. Use adversarial or reinforcement learning to iteratively improve pragmatic correctness based on user feedback."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while comprehensive, appears ambitious and may underestimate the significant challenges in constructing or extending culturally relevant knowledge graphs for very low-resource languages. The plan should include more concrete strategies to address data scarcity, such as leveraging weak supervision, crowdsourcing, or transfer learning from related domains/languages. Additionally, the annotation of datasets for subtle sociocultural and pragmatic features like sarcasm and emotion in diverse low-resource languages is nontrivial; more details on annotation protocols, annotator expertise, or use of proxy signals are needed to increase feasibility. Lastly, the fallback plan would benefit from more explicit criteria for switching strategies and detailed methods to measure and ensure pragmatic correctness through user feedback incorporating iterative model updates. Strengthening these aspects will make the experimental approach much more scientifically sound and executable in practice, given the inherent complexities of the task and target languages involved. This is critical before committing extensive resources to model development and evaluation phases in low-resource multilingual settings, especially those with complex grammar and cultural nuances as proposed in the problem statement and motivation sections.  Please clarify and elaborate on these practical steps and risk mitigation measures in the Experiment_Plan section to increase confidence in feasibility and success potential of the work overall, especially since novelty is competitive in this research area and strong empirical validation will determine impact and acceptance potential at premier venues.  (This critique targets Experiment_Plan and its technical specifics.)"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment, to enhance the idea's impact and distinctiveness, I suggest integrating insights from the 'social dimensions of language', 'interpersonal communication', and 'figurative language processing' concepts into the model architecture and evaluation. For instance, the model could incorporate social psychology theory-driven features or contextual variables reflecting learner individual differences and second-language instruction factors, thereby enabling fine-grained adaptation of sociocultural pragmatics beyond static knowledge graphs. Additionally, leveraging applied linguistics research on pragmatic functions in cross-cultural communication could guide specialized embeddings or context encodings to better handle figurative language and style transfer in low-resource settings. Incorporating such cross-disciplinary aspects may elevate the research beyond current computational linguistics and affective computing approaches, sharpening its contribution and potential for high impact. This integration can be concretely achieved by collaborating with linguists or social scientists and including task-specific benchmarks inspired by interpersonal communication studies. This suggestion aims to broaden both the model's practical relevance and theoretical novelty, thereby improving the proposal's competitiveness in top-tier venues and appealing to a wider interdisciplinary audience. (Targets Propose_Method and broader idea framing.)"
