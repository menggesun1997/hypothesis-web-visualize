    "title": "Noisy Channel Guided Morphosyntactic Robustness for Low-Resource Languages",
    "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource language models struggle with complex morphosyntactic phenomena, leading to instability and hallucinated content in generation tasks under data scarcity.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the internal gap of insufficient handling of complex grammatical structures by integrating noisy channel probabilistic models as a bridge to enhance robustness during generation and inconsistency detection phases specifically for morphologically rich, low-resource languages.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a morphosyntactic-aware noisy channel model that explicitly models the generation and recognition probabilities of morphological and syntactic units. This model will be integrated within an end-to-end sequence-to-sequence framework, allowing joint optimization to penalize unlikely morphological constructs during decoding. The approach leverages unsupervised morphological tagging and syntactic parsing from high-resource languages for cross-lingual transfer learning.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect corpora for target low-resource morphologically complex languages (e.g., Urdu, Bangla). 2) Train morphological analyzers and parsers using transfer learning from related languages. 3) Implement a noisy channel model framework incorporating morphosyntactic probabilities. 4) Integrate with transformer-based generation models for tasks like summarization and dialogue. 5) Evaluate morphosyntactic accuracy, hallucination rate reduction, and overall fluency against existing baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Bangla sentence \"সে রাতে দোকান বন্ধ ছিলা।\" (The shop was closed that night.). Expected Output: System correctly generates consistent morphosyntactic forms in summaries or dialogue without hallucinated tense or agreement errors.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If explicit morphosyntactic modeling proves inefficient, fallback to implicit modeling via multitask learning with auxiliary morphological tagging objectives within transformer architectures, or data augmentation techniques simulating morphological variations."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed morphosyntactic-aware noisy channel model is conceptually promising but lacks clarity on how morphological and syntactic unit probabilities will be jointly modeled and optimized within an end-to-end sequence-to-sequence framework. Specifically, details on the interaction between noisy channel components and transformer-based decoders, and how unsupervised morphological tagging integrates into training, should be explicitly clarified with formalized probabilistic formulation and concrete algorithmic steps. Clarifying these aspects can strengthen the soundness of the method and better convince reviewers of its feasibility and novelty potential within morphologically complex, low-resource settings, avoiding ambiguity about the integration pipeline and optimization procedure. Consider including model architecture diagrams and exact loss formulations for added transparency and reproducibility in the next iteration of the proposal, as this will directly impact confidence in the core mechanism's validity and effectiveness in addressing the stated problem statement while maintaining decoder fluency and consistency without hallucination artifacts during generation tasks such as summarization or dialogue generation under data scarcity conditions specific to languages like Urdu and Bangla.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed experimental plan broadly covers logical steps, it underestimates the complexity of training reliable morphological analyzers and syntactic parsers through cross-lingual transfer learning for highly diverse morphosyntactic systems in low-resource languages such as Urdu and Bangla. Additional details on source languages selection, adaptation strategies, evaluation metrics for transferred parsers, and mitigation of noisy or domain-mismatched training data are necessary for assessing feasibility concretely. Moreover, integrating the morphosyntactic noisy channel with transformer-based generation models will require substantial engineering; the proposal should clarify planned approaches for joint optimization and computational resource requirements.\n\nTo improve, the plan should include intermediate validation stages focused on morphological tagger and parser quality, baseline comparisons, and ablation studies isolating effects of noisy channel integration. This ensures stepwise validation of components and identifies bottlenecks early. Also, defining explicit quantitative and qualitative metrics for hallucination detection and morphosyntactic consistency will guide rigorous evaluation. Including fallback plans targeting potential failure modes for transfer learning and noisy channel implementation with relevant performance thresholds can improve robustness and increase confidence in feasibility before full-scale end-to-end experiments. Without such details, the experimental plan risks being overly optimistic regarding timelines and success probability on real-world morphologically complex low-resource datasets."
