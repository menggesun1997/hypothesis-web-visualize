Current CNN architectures provide efficient convolutional patterns but lack application in NLP transformer design, limiting practical edge deployment.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses internal gap of integrating CNN architectural efficiency with transformer-based LLMs for edge NLP. Novel hybrid microarchitectures borrow CNN principles (multi-path, residual connections) tailored explicitly for transformer layers to reduce inference cost without losing language understanding capabilities.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design microarchitectural modules combining lightweight convolutional blocks with efficient multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Replace or augment some transformer feed-forward or attention layers with convolutional counterparts using squeeze-and-excitation and channel boosting principles. Use residual shortcut connections throughout to ensure gradient flow. The architecture will be a modular, configurable template allowing dynamic path selection based on resource availability. Incorporate quantization-aware training and pruning specialized for this hybrid model to compress size and runtime further.",
