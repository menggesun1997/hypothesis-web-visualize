        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language models (LLMs) analyzing social media text inadequately incorporate psychological distress and clinical factors, which leads to overlooked subtle biases adversely affecting vulnerable populations, particularly those at risk for severe mental health outcomes such as suicide or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",
        "Motivation": "While prior works connect LLM bias mitigation and psychological factors, our approach significantly advances novelty by integrating interdisciplinary clinical data within an adaptive bias mitigation framework explicitly designed for e-health applicability. We address the critical gap of embedding clinically validated psychological distress indicators into LLM fairness evaluation and correction, with a translational aim toward suicide prevention and PTSD screening interventions. This cross-modal, clinically grounded methodology targets both algorithmic fairness and downstream mental health outcomes, thus setting our work apart in scope and impact and responding directly to the urgent public health need for equitable AI tools in sensitive clinical domains.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-stage adaptive bias mitigation framework that incorporates psychological distress and Problematic Internet Use (PIU) severity metrics derived from ethically obtained clinical-social datasets. Our method couples pretrained LLMs with a dedicated psychological embedding module, constructed from clinically validated self-report scales and behavioral indicators, integrated via a neural fusion layer into LLM hidden states. Bias detection utilizes these embeddings in conjunction with fairness disparity indices tailored to mental health-sensitive contexts. The bias correction layer recalibrates model outputs dynamically, exploiting gradient-based adjustment informed by psychological vulnerability features. To ensure clinical relevance and real-world efficacy, we design follow-up pilot e-health trials embedding the model within suicide prevention and PTSD screening platforms, measuring impact on clinical outcomes and quality-of-life metrics via controlled trial protocols. Technical details include the architecture of the psychological embedding module, training procedure with multimodal loss functions balancing fairness and prediction accuracy, and strict data anonymization and privacy-preserving mechanisms.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Acquisition: Obtain and curate social media datasets with linked clinical assessments of psychological distress and PIU (e.g., via collaborations with mental health studies and publicly available corpora like CLPsych), ensuring ethical compliance through informed consent frameworks and data anonymization. 2) Annotation Protocols: Incorporate standardized psychological scales (e.g., GAD-7 for anxiety, PCL-5 for PTSD symptoms) mapped onto social media text segments by expert annotators under IRB oversight. 3) Model Development: Fine-tune pretrained LLMs with multimodal inputs incorporating psychological embeddings derived from clinical data and user surveys. 4) Bias Detection and Correction: Implement the fusion and calibration layers, specifying integration points at intermediate transformer layers, and apply bias detection using tailored fairness and psychological harm risk metrics. 5) Pilot Validation: Conduct initial experiments using simulated or semi-synthetic data to mitigate scarcity risks, validate embedding efficacy, and refine model architecture. 6) E-Health Intervention Integration: Deploy the refined model within a pilot randomized controlled trial embedded in a suicide prevention or PTSD digital mental health platform, measuring both model fairness and clinical endpoints such as symptom reduction and quality of life improvements. 7) Analysis: Use Cochrane risk-of-bias assessments for trial quality and employ statistical analyses to quantify fairness gains and clinical impact.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A tweet exhibiting language indicative of acute anxiety and suicidal ideation, combined with metadata reflecting problematic internet use patterns. Output: The model outputs adjusted sentiment and toxicity scores that consciously reduce bias against this vulnerable user profile while flagging potential clinical risk factors for downstream e-health intervention triage. For instance, toxic content detection thresholds adapt to avoid over-penalizing distress-expressive language, and alerts for suicide risk are generated with calibrated sensitivity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If clinical psychological embeddings do not demonstrably improve bias mitigation or model fairness, we will conduct comprehensive feature ablation studies to isolate the most impactful clinical indicators. We will explore alternative clinical variables such as quality-of-life scores and symptom severity indices, or shift focus to data augmentation with synthetic distress examples to bolster model robustness. Additionally, if data availability or ethical barriers prove insurmountable, we will pivot towards simulated clinical-social datasets and leverage transfer learning from related domains to preserve research momentum."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while logically structured, lacks clarity on data acquisition feasibility and potential ethical/privacy concerns when collecting psychological distress and PIU-labeled social media data. The plan should specify data sources, annotation protocols, and address handling sensitive clinical information, including consent and anonymization. Additionally, the methodology for integrating psychological embeddings into bias detection and calibration layers needs more technical detail to assess feasibility and reproducibility effectively. Clarifying these points will strengthen the practical soundness of the experimental framework and reduce risks of implementation obstacles or data scarcity impacting progress substantially. Consider including pilot validation phases or simulated data to mitigate data availability challenges upfront in the plan. This refinement will boost confidence in the project's viability and execution roadmap, which currently is too abstract for a complex interdisciplinary task such as this one.\n\nRecommended actionable step: Add detailed sections on ethical data collection procedures, concrete dataset examples, and precise technical descriptions of how psychological embeddings interface with LLM bias layers, possibly supported by preliminary pilot results or references to established frameworks handling similar clinical-social data integrations in NLP contexts.\n\nTargeted sections: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, Proposed_Method"

This would address a critical application domain where psychological distress is central and where bias in LLM analyses has potentially severe public health consequences.\n\nRecommended actionable step: Extend the research scope by proposing follow-up pilot clinical or e-health deployment studies that evaluate not only model fairness but also clinical outcomes or quality-of-life improvements in vulnerable populations. Leveraging linked global concepts such as \"randomized controlled trials,\" \"e-health interventions,\" and \"post-traumatic stress disorder\" can provide a compelling interdisciplinary bridge enhancing scientific novelty and societal benefit.\n\nTargeted sections: Motivation, Proposed_Method, Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
