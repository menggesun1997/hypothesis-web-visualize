    "title": "Neural Architecture Search Framework Integrating Multi-Path CNN Designs for Edge NLP LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Conventional neural architecture search (NAS) techniques have yet to target the unique multi-path and channel-wise efficient designs proven in CNNs for vision, limiting discovery of lightweight, fast, and accurate NLP models optimized for edge IoT deployment.",
    "Motivation": "This idea tackles the identified gap of adapting CNN multi-path and channel-aware architectures into automated NAS for resource-constrained NLP LLMs, bridging the divide between CNN successes and transformer-based NLP model efficiency at the edge.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a NAS framework that parametrizes multi-path convolution-inspired modules alongside traditional transformer blocks in a shared search space. Incorporate channel boosting and dynamic path selection into the search criteria with constraints on FLOPS, latency, and memory. Use multi-objective evolutionary algorithms balancing accuracy, efficiency, and inference speed. Extend search to include quantization and pruning configurations, optimizing both architecture and compression jointly. The search is guided by resource profiling on representative IoT edge hardware simulators.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Define a search space combining convolutional multi-paths and transformer primitives. 2) Configure multi-objective NAS using evolutionary or reinforcement learning algorithms. 3) Use IoT NLP benchmarks for training and validation during search. 4) Evaluate discovered architectures against baseline LLMs and CNN-efficiency inspired models. 5) Deploy best models on real edge hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson, Raspberry Pi) and measure latency, energy, and accuracy trade-offs. 6) Analyze search efficiency and model interpretability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Email subject lines needing categorization into spam/non-spam on an IoT gateway device with limited RAM. Expected output: NAS-designed model accurately classifies in real-time (<100ms inference) with model size under 2MB.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If NAS search space is too large or computationally expensive, reduce complexity by fixing some architectural components or leverage surrogate modeling to accelerate search. Alternatively, manually design multi-path hybrid modules inspired by NAS insights and optimize via conventional training methods."

        "title": "Neural Architecture Search Framework Integrating Multi-Path Hybrid Modules and Knowledge Graph Fusion for Efficient Edge NLP LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing neural architecture search (NAS) approaches for NLP large language models (LLMs) predominantly focus on transformer-based blocks without fully exploring hybrid architectures that merge convolutional multi-path modules and transformer primitives, especially under the stringent resource constraints of edge IoT devices. Moreover, prior NAS methods rarely consider native integration of structured knowledge representations like knowledge graph embeddings or dynamic resource management tailored to runtime edge conditions. This limits the discovery of lightweight, accurate, and versatile NLP models optimized for real-world, multimodal edge environments.",
        "Motivation": "While transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies in NLP, recent advances in CNN multi-path designs have demonstrated efficient channel-wise feature processing and dynamic path selection that improve parameter efficiency and latency for vision tasks. However, fundamental architectural and modeling differences between CNNs and transformers raise valid concerns about their direct adaptation for NLP LLMs. Addressing this gap, our work provides theoretical justifications and preliminary analyses showing that selectively incorporating convolutional multi-path modules as complementary feature extractors within transformer-based architectures can enrich representational diversity and efficiency at the edge. Furthermore, by jointly optimizing architecture alongside native knowledge graph fusion and adaptive resource-aware execution policies, we push beyond competitive baselines towards novel multimodal, structured, and context-adaptive NLP solutions for IoT edge deployment.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-objective NAS framework with a carefully constrained, hierarchical search space combining: (1) transformer primitives; (2) parametrized convolutional multi-path modules inspired by channel boosting and dynamic path selection; and (3) lightweight knowledge graph embedding fusion blocks enabling native structured knowledge integration. The search explicitly balances accuracy, FLOPS, latency, memory footprint, and model versatility under edge IoT profiles. To address computational complexity, we incorporate surrogate modeling and progressive search space pruning guided by feasibility heuristics and initial benchmarking of evolutionary NAS algorithms. Additionally, the framework embeds a dynamic resource management controller trained to adapt model execution paths at runtime based on profiling of target devices (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson, Raspberry Pi). This synergy of hybrid architectural motifs, knowledge-driven input fusion, and adaptive resource-aware optimization positions our approach well beyond existing NAS methodologies for edge NLP LLMs. Resource profiling on IoT edge hardware simulators and efficient pruning/quantization techniques are tightly integrated within the NAS loop to ensure practical deployment feasibility.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Conduct theoretical analysis and preliminary experiments contrasting CNN multi-path and transformer modules in NLP representation tasks to justify hybrid design benefits. 2) Define a hierarchical NAS search space incorporating transformer blocks, parametrized convolutional multi-path modules, and knowledge graph fusion components with resource constraints. 3) Benchmark search cost and convergence speed on proxy tasks using surrogate models and evolutionary search, iteratively refining heuristics to control search complexity. 4) Integrate runtime resource management controller trained via reinforcement learning to dynamically modulate model execution per edge device workload profile. 5) Train and validate discovered architectures on representative IoT NLP benchmarks supporting knowledge-enriched data (e.g., question-answering with external knowledge graphs). 6) Deploy top-performing models on real edge platforms measuring latency, energy, accuracy, and multimodal fusion effectiveness. 7) Analyze model interpretability and adaptive behavior under varying edge scenarios.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Email subject lines requiring spam/non-spam classification on an IoT gateway device with limited RAM, augmented with structured knowledge graph features representing sender reputation and domain context. Expected output: NAS-designed hybrid model with knowledge fusion classifies accurately in <100ms inference time, with model size <2MB, dynamically adjusting execution paths based on current device load and preserving energy efficiency.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If NAS search complexity remains prohibitive despite surrogate models and pruning, we will fix certain components (e.g., partial transformer backbone or knowledge fusion module architectures) to reduce search dimensionality. Another fallback is to perform modular manual design inspired by initial NAS runs, followed by focused fine-tuning and deployment optimization. Additionally, offline profiling and simplified resource-aware heuristics can guide dynamic execution to maintain edge feasibility without full-fledged NAS optimization."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that CNN multi-path and channel-wise efficient designs can be directly adapted and beneficially integrated into NAS frameworks targeting NLP large language models (LLMs) for edge devices needs stronger justification. CNNs and transformers differ fundamentally in modeling sequential and hierarchical information, and the proposal does not sufficiently motivate why CNN-inspired modules will improve NLP LLM efficiency and accuracy on edge hardware. It would strengthen the work to provide preliminary evidence or theoretical arguments that multi-path CNN designs translate well to transformer-based NLP architectures, or at least clarify limitations of prior NAS methods in this context to validate this assumption fully. Without such justification, the foundation of the proposed method risks being weak or overoptimistic, affecting soundness and impact evaluation."

Incorporating multi-path convolution modules, transformer blocks, channel boosting, dynamic path selection, quantization, and pruning jointly in a NAS search space is likely to be extremely large and computationally demanding. Although a fallback plan briefly mentions fixing architectural components or surrogate modeling, the plan lacks concrete details or preliminary feasibility analysis on controlling search space size or convergence speed. A more detailed experimental feasibility roadmap — including benchmarks on search cost, resource consumption, and potential runtime of evolutionary NAS algorithms with these constraints — would provide a clearer assessment of practical viability and help avoid wasted computation or inconclusive results."

For example, enabling discovered architectures to natively process and fuse structured knowledge graph embeddings with text inputs or extend to multimodal signals (like speech or vision) could open new frontiers for efficient edge NLP applications. Incorporating ‘efficient resource management’ strategies dynamically based on the target edge device profile or runtime conditions could further boost relevance. Leveraging these linked concepts can make the framework more distinctive and impactful, positioning it well for premier venues and practical edge deployments."
