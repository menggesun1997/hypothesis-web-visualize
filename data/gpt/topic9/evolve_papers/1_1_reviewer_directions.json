    "title": "Cross-Lingual Human-Aligned Evaluation Metrics for Low-Resource Summarization",
    "Problem_Statement": "Evaluation metrics for abstractive summarization in low-resource languages do not adequately reflect human judgment, especially given linguistic diversity and scarcity of evaluation data, impeding reliable progress.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external gap of imperfect alignment between automatic evaluation metrics and human judgment in low-resource contexts, and leverages the opportunity to combine noisy channel-based error modeling with human signals for robust evaluation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a cross-lingual evaluation framework by training auxiliary noisy channel models that model typical summarization errors in low-resource languages based on transfer learning from similar high-resource languages. Integrate this with human-annotated evaluation signals collected via crowd-sourcing campaigns in target languages. Employ a meta-evaluation approach training a learned metric combining lexical, semantic embedding, and noisy channel estimated error probabilities to better align with humans.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Aggregate parallel summarization datasets across multiple languages, including low-resource ones, with human evaluation annotations. 2) Train noisy channel models to identify typical errors. 3) Develop and train a learned evaluation metric incorporating noisy channel error predictions, embedding similarities (e.g., multilingual BERT), and traditional metrics. 4) Validate correlation improvements against human judgment compared to BLEU/ROUGE. 5) Test generalization on novel low-resource languages and domains.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Generated summary in Marathi for a Hindi news article. Existing metric scores 0.65 BLEU, human scores 0.80 for correctness. Proposed metric adjusts to 0.79 correlating closer with human judgment, correctly penalizing hallucinations and missed key points.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If noisy channel modeling introduces noise, shift to ensemble learning combining semantic similarity metrics and crowd-sourced feedback signals alone. Investigate unsupervised metric learning with synthetic error injection as alternative."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines training noisy channel models and integrating them with human-annotated evaluation signals, yet it lacks detailed clarity on how these noisy channel models will be constructed specifically for low-resource languages with minimal data. Additionally, the mechanism of combining lexical, embedding, and error probability signals into a learned metric needs further specification—e.g., model architecture, training objectives, and how these components interact—to adequately assess soundness and replication feasibility. Clarifying these details will strengthen the methodological soundness and enable critical assessment of whether the approach truly captures error patterns distinctive to low-resource summarization contexts and aligns with human judgment reliably across languages and domains. Consider elaborating on the noisy channel model formulation, data requirements, handling of scarce human annotation, and fusion strategy within the learned metric framework to enhance conceptual transparency and validity of assumptions behind the approach's soundness and effectiveness metrics correlation improvement claims in the Test_Case_Examples section and overall evaluation framework design. This expanded explanation is crucial especially given the competitive novelty environment where incremental methodological clarity and rigor can be a differentiating factor for impact and practical adoption in NLP research on low-resource languages and summarization evaluation metrics development, as linked to state-of-the-art and cross-lingual transfer concepts from the dataset and methods space included in the global concepts list provided here for context and refinement guidance purposes only as part of actionable feedback recommendations in the Proposed_Method section itself where the method core logic is described explicitly in the proposal text here in the Input Data for your review section 1 provided by the Innovator prior submission for review at this stage of study and development planning for this project idea shown for review now at this second-level evaluation stage consistent with novel, competitive ideas setting in premier NLP conferences like ACL and NeurIPS as per the role and task given to the reviewer assigned here to provide deep-dive critiques in soundness dimension to assist improvement before full paper drafting and empirical experimentation phases commence (or concurrent iteration adjustments). Thank you! Please incorporate technical robustness details to address this feedback point efficiently and convincingly in next revision cycle or proposal draft update phases post initial review feedback receipt to enhance credibility overall! Also, please verify when describing noisy channel models and meta-evaluation learning metric fusion steps how you plan to quantitatively test component contributions both independently and jointly to confirm additive or synergistic effects on metric improvement and generalization qualities are well captured and justified with transparent equations where relevant if possible for review clarity purposes to better establish concept rigor here as well! This will deeply help manuscript reviewers critically evaluate the approach by theory and preliminary feasibility or simulation studies prior to full-scale multilingual experimental deployment shown in the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan detailed design stage definition here now in the submission context for this review cycle session documented. Cheers! :) \n\nBest regards, seasoned area chair reviewer with ACL and NeurIPS experience."

          "feedback_content": "Given the reported novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the global concept links including multilingual BERT, cross-lingual transfer, and few-shot learning methods, I suggest the Innovator explicitly incorporate state-of-the-art cross-lingual and few-shot learning paradigms (e.g., prompt-tuning or adaptor modules for multilingual transformers) to adapt noisy channel models and learned evaluation metrics for truly low-resource languages with minimal supervision. Additionally, integrating multimodal learning signals—such as combining textual input with audiovisual news summarization cues or leveraging dialogue summarization datasets where applicable—could significantly broaden the impact and novelty of the work. This approach aligns with recent advances in deep multimodal learning and vision-language models, thereby enhancing robustness and generalizability of the evaluation metric beyond text-only settings. Considering this integration as a modular extension or core baseline comparison within the proposed framework will position the work more strongly to advance the NLP community's progress in abstractive dialogue and document summarization evaluation, especially under scarce data scenarios common in low-resource language contexts and related to the broader FSL (few-shot learning) methods landscape. This suggestion should be reflected in future experiment plan iterations and in framing the envisioned impact scope accordingly to increase appeal to premier conference audiences and potential real-world application scenarios that demand robust, human-aligned metrics for multilingual summarization tasks across multiple domains."
