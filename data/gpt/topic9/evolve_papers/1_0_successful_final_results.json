    "title": "Multimodal Inconsistency Detection for Low-Resource Dialogue Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current low-resource language dialogue systems often produce outputs with factual inconsistencies and hallucinations due to sparse training data and insufficient tailored inconsistency detection mechanisms, limiting their practical usability and user trust.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of lack of rigorous inconsistency detection tailored for low-resource languages and the high-potential innovation opportunity combining dialogue generation with inconsistency detection and noisy channel modeling. It leverages the hidden bridge between these domains into an integrated solution.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel dialogue system architecture integrating a multimodal inconsistency-aware module that incorporates natural language inference (NLI) with discourse-aware hierarchical planning and noisy channel model components. This module jointly evaluates generated dialogue turns against prior context and external structured knowledge graphs enriched for low-resource languages. Pretrained cross-lingual transformer models fine-tuned with adversarial examples of hallucinated outputs will form the backbone. The approach will also integrate morphological analysis to handle complex grammatical structures unique to languages such as Bangla and Indo-Aryan variants.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect and curate contextualized low-resource dialogue datasets augmented with knowledge graph annotations. 2) Pretrain cross-lingual transformer models on multilingual data with syntactic morphological tagging. 3) Build and integrate an inconsistency detection module combining NLI with noisy channel probabilities. 4) Evaluate dialogue fluency, factual consistency via human annotation and automatic metrics including BLEU, ROUGE, and custom factuality scores. 5) Compare against baseline dialogue generation models without inconsistency modules. 6) Conduct ablation studies on multimodality and knowledge graph integration.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User asks in Bangla \"আমি আগামীকাল আবহাওয়া কেমন হবে?\" (What will the weather be like tomorrow?). Expected Output: Dialogue system responds with factually consistent, context-aware answer referencing external knowledge (e.g., \"আগামীকাল ধূপ-বাদল থাকবে, তাপমাত্রা ৩২ ডিগ্রী সেলসিয়াস।\" - Tomorrow it will be partly cloudy with 32°C). The system flags or corrects responses that hallucinate weather or give inconsistent information.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal NLI fails to scale, fallback to purely text-based inconsistency detection enhanced with augmented data via back-translation. If noisy channel integration underperforms, revert to separate post-generation verification modules. Additionally, explore rule-based morphological consistency checks as complementary heuristics."

        "title": "Intelligent Multimodal Inconsistency Detection for Low-Resource Dialogue Systems via Constrained Markov Decision Processes",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current low-resource language dialogue systems suffer from frequent factual inconsistencies, hallucinations, and grammatical errors due to limited training data, noisy and scarce knowledge graph annotations, and the absence of principled decision-making frameworks tailored to preserve factuality and morphological correctness. These issues undermine practical usability and user trust, and existing approaches lack scalable, robust methods that integrate morphological awareness with intelligent, constrained learning paradigms.",
        "Motivation": "While low-resource dialogue systems have explored inconsistency detection through multimodal signals and natural language inference (NLI), these approaches lack integration with rigorous decision-making frameworks that optimize consistency while balancing fluency and morphological correctness constraints. Our work innovatively bridges this gap by modeling dialogue generation and inconsistency detection as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), enabling policy learning that actively enforces factual consistency and linguistic quality under resource constraints. Leveraging large-scale multilingual pretrained transformers and advanced automatic factuality evaluation methods differentiates our approach in the NOV-COMPETITIVE landscape. This fusion of intelligent decision-making, morphological analysis, and noisy channel modeling offers a scalable and impactful pathway for transforming low-resource dialogue systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel dialogue generation framework that unifies multimodal inconsistency detection and morphological analysis within a CMDP formulation. The method involves: (1) pretrained cross-lingual transformer backbones fine-tuned on multilingual corpora with embedded morphological tags to capture complex low-resource language grammar; (2) integration of external low-resource knowledge graphs enriched via robust augmentation and validation pipelines; (3) a multimodal inconsistency-aware module combining natural language inference (NLI), noisy channel modeling probabilities, and morphological consistency scores as state features; (4) a constrained policy learning mechanism that optimizes dialogue output generation to maximize factual consistency reward subject to fluency and morphological correctness constraints within the CMDP framework; (5) incremental adversarial training using synthetically generated hallucinated examples validated through back-translation and data augmentation techniques to ensure stability; and (6) advanced automatic metrics for factual consistency, including recently proposed factuality evaluation models beyond n-gram overlaps, complemented by human annotation. This approach embodies intelligent decision-making principles and pattern recognition paradigms to robustly address the low-resource challenges while boosting novelty and scalability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Curation and Validation: Collect low-resource language dialogues with knowledge graph annotations, complemented by morphological annotation via expert and semi-automatic pipelines, with quality assurance through inter-annotator agreement and linguistic validation. 2) Knowledge Graph Augmentation: Use data mining and back-translation to enrich knowledge graphs, coupled with noise reduction heuristics using rule-based morphological consistency checks. 3) Model Pretraining: Fine-tune large-scale multilingual transformer models with explicit morphological tagging, leveraging transfer learning from high-resource languages. 4) Adversarial Example Generation: Create hallucinated dialogue turns through automated perturbations, verified via back-translation and morphological consistency validators, to serve as adversarial training data. 5) Incremental Model Integration: Stage 1 - Train inconsistency detection module separately with quantitative progress milestones (e.g., ROC-AUC thresholds); Stage 2 - Incorporate noisy channel modeling with validation checkpoints; Stage 3 - Integrate within CMDP dialogue generation policy, monitored by constrained reward optimization metrics. 6) Model Training with CMDP: Implement constrained reinforcement learning algorithms to learn policies maximizing factual consistency while ensuring fluency and morphological correctness constraints, with progressive evaluation on held-out sets. 7) Thorough Evaluation: Employ advanced automatic factuality metrics, BLEU/ROUGE, morphological consistency scores, and human evaluation focusing on factual accuracy and linguistic quality. 8) Ablation Studies and Fallbacks: Systematically disable components (e.g., noisy channel, morphological module) to assess contribution, with fallback to purely text-based inconsistency detection or post-generation verification if integration underperforms. Quantitative criteria for proceeding through each stage ensure robustness and feasibility in resource-limited contexts.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User query in Bangla \"আমি আগামিকাาล আবহাওয়া কেমন হবে?\" (\"What will the weather be like tomorrow?\") Expected Output: \"আগামিকাাল ধূপ-বাদল থাকবে়, তাপমাত্রা ৩২ ডিগ্রি সেলসিয়াস।\" (\"Tomorrow it will be partly cloudy with 32°C.\") The system should generate this response without hallucination and with grammatical correctness, flagging or correcting inconsistent or morphologically incorrect alternatives. Test cases will include adversarial inputs with ambiguous context or partial knowledge graph coverage to validate the CMDP policy's ability to manage uncertainty and maintain consistency under constraints.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal NLI or noisy channel integration proves unstable, revert to modular pipeline architectures where inconsistency detection operates as a separate post-generation verification module using augmented text-only datasets enhanced by back-translation and morphological heuristics. Should CMDP-based policy learning face convergence or scalability issues, fallback to supervised fine-tuning with weighted loss functions reflecting consistency and morphology, combined with rule-based post-processing. Additionally, incorporate human-in-the-loop correction cycles during dataset curation to mitigate annotation noise and improve quality for iterative retraining."

The plan should include specific strategies for dataset creation/validation and methods to ensure the quality and representativeness of morphological tagging for highly diverse language variants. Additionally, adversarial example generation for hallucinations and the integration of noisy channel modeling are complex tasks that might require incremental validation steps to ensure stability before full integration. Providing more details or fallback validation milestones would improve feasibility assessment substantially, reducing risk of stalled progress during end-to-end system integration and evaluation phases, especially in under-resourced settings. Overall, enhancing practical dataset and robustness strategies will improve scientific soundness and execution likelihood of the plan, given the high complexity of multimodal NLI and morphological analysis in underrepresented languages. \n\nSuggestion: explicitly include dataset validation/augmentation sub-steps, staged integration with quantitative progress criteria, and fallback checkpoints for critical model components within the experiment plan to ensure feasibility and experiment tractability under resource constraints or tooling limitations.  \n\n[FEA-EXPERIMENT] applies to Proposed_Method and Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan sections."

For example, modeling the dialogue generation and inconsistency detection process as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) where policies are learned to maximize factual consistency under constraints of fluency and morphological correctness can provide a rigorous learning framework. This could synergize well with intelligent decision-making concepts to improve robustness and efficiency, especially in low-resource languages. Additionally, leveraging recent advances in large-scale multilingual language models for pretraining, combined with advanced automatic evaluation methods tailored for factuality rather than n-gram overlaps, would bolster both feasibility and impact. This integration would differentiate the work strongly from existing approaches and elevate its contribution in the competitive space.  \n\n[So this suggestion complements the existing proposal by expanding methodological rigor and linking to broader AI paradigms, addressing NOV-COMPETITIVE concerns.]\n\n[SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION] applies across Proposed_Method and Motivation sections."
