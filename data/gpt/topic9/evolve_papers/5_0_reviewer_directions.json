    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs analyzing social media text fail to integrate psychological distress and clinical factors, leading to overlooked subtle biases affecting vulnerable users.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap of lacking integration between AI text generation and psychological/clinical sciences, per the identified critical gaps. Novel because it uses interdisciplinary data to inform bias mitigation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive bias mitigation framework embedding psychological distress and Problematic Internet Use (PIU) severity metrics into LLM fairness evaluation. It couples pretrained LLMs with a psychological embedding module derived from clinical data and user surveys. Bias correction layers recalibrate model outputs by factoring in psychological vulnerability indicators.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect social media text datasets labeled with psychological distress and PIU metrics. 2) Fine-tune existing LLMs with this augmented data. 3) Implement bias detection component utilizing psychological embeddings. 4) Compare with standard bias mitigation baselines on fairness metrics and mental health-sensitive evaluation. 5) Use evaluation metrics including fairness disparity indices, psychological harm risk measures, and user impact simulations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Tweet from a user showing signs of anxiety-related language. Output: Model adjusts sentiment and toxicity prediction to avoid amplifying distress signals or biasing against vulnerable populations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If psychological embeddings do not improve fairness, fallback to feature ablation studies to isolate impactful psychological indicators, or incorporate other clinical features such as quality-of-life scores."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while logically structured, lacks clarity on data acquisition feasibility and potential ethical/privacy concerns when collecting psychological distress and PIU-labeled social media data. The plan should specify data sources, annotation protocols, and address handling sensitive clinical information, including consent and anonymization. Additionally, the methodology for integrating psychological embeddings into bias detection and calibration layers needs more technical detail to assess feasibility and reproducibility effectively. Clarifying these points will strengthen the practical soundness of the experimental framework and reduce risks of implementation obstacles or data scarcity impacting progress substantially. Consider including pilot validation phases or simulated data to mitigate data availability challenges upfront in the plan. This refinement will boost confidence in the project's viability and execution roadmap, which currently is too abstract for a complex interdisciplinary task such as this one.\n\nRecommended actionable step: Add detailed sections on ethical data collection procedures, concrete dataset examples, and precise technical descriptions of how psychological embeddings interface with LLM bias layers, possibly supported by preliminary pilot results or references to established frameworks handling similar clinical-social data integrations in NLP contexts.\n\nTargeted sections: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "Since the novelty is rated as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the core components already have close existing links, a strong way to significantly enhance impact and novelty is to incorporate evaluation or intervention design aligned with \"e-health interventions\" or \"suicide prevention.\" Embedding the model refinement and bias mitigation framework into practical randomized controlled trials or e-health platforms focused on suicide prevention or post-traumatic stress disorder screening could greatly expand real-world relevance and downstream impact. This would address a critical application domain where psychological distress is central and where bias in LLM analyses has potentially severe public health consequences.\n\nRecommended actionable step: Extend the research scope by proposing follow-up pilot clinical or e-health deployment studies that evaluate not only model fairness but also clinical outcomes or quality-of-life improvements in vulnerable populations. Leveraging linked global concepts such as \"randomized controlled trials,\" \"e-health interventions,\" and \"post-traumatic stress disorder\" can provide a compelling interdisciplinary bridge enhancing scientific novelty and societal benefit.\n\nTargeted sections: Motivation, Proposed_Method, Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
