    "title": "InterdisciplinaryBiasMetricSuite",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluation metrics fail to holistically assess fairness of LLMs in social media text analysis considering psychological, clinical, and socio-economic dimensions.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses critical gaps on literature synthesis and evaluation by proposing novel interdisciplinary fairness metrics integrating insights from psychology, clinical sciences, and commerce.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a composite metric suite that evaluates bias not only on traditional statistical measures but also incorporates psychological harm indices, quality-of-life impact estimations, and socio-economic fairness scores, applied to AI-generated social media analysis outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Review interdisciplinary literature to define novel fairness dimensions. 2) Operationalize these into computational metrics. 3) Evaluate existing LLM outputs on social media datasets. 4) Demonstrate metric utility by correlating with human judgments from experts in psychology and social sciences.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI-generated sentiment analysis on posts mentioning mental health across socio-economic groups. Output: Metric suite reveals subtle biases invisible to accuracy-only evaluation, prompting model retraining.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If metric components are hard to quantify, fallback to proxy metrics or conduct qualitative validation studies to refine metric design iteratively."
