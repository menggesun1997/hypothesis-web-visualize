Please provide detailed methodology on the fusion strategy (e.g., late fusion, attention-based fusion) and how bias mitigation layers adjust predictions based on multimodal signals, including potential model architectures or training regimes to ensure repeatability and conceptual soundness.\n\nWithout this clarity, the approach risks being vague and difficult to replicate, undermining soundness and interpretability of the bias mitigation strategy in the multimodal context. Explicitly addressing these would strengthen the theoretical foundation and practical guidance for implementation or extension by others in the field. This is critical before proceeding to experiments or impact claims.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"

Additionally, contingency measures beyond fallback modality processing strategies should be elaborated to tackle data sparsity or cross-modal alignment difficulties.\n\nAddressing these feasibility concerns will ensure that experiments are practical, reproducible, and impactful.\n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
