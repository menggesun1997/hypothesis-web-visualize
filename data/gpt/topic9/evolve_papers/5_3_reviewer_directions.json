    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap connecting clinical psychology and AI by embedding latent clinical features to enhance fairness evaluation and mitigation in LLMs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a transformer-based latent embedding module pre-trained on clinical interview transcripts and distress-related text, attached as an auxiliary input to existing LLMs. Use this signal to detect and mitigate biases disproportionately affecting users with clinical symptoms.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect and preprocess clinical corpora linked to social media text. 2) Pre-train latent embedding module to encode distress features. 3) Fine-tune LLM with auxiliary clinical embeddings. 4) Evaluate with fairness metrics focusing on clinical subgroup disparities.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Social media post from a user indicating mild depression. Output: Adjusted sentiment classification minimizing bias that would marginalize or misclassify mental health expressions.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If latent embedding pre-training is ineffective, fallback to multi-task learning jointly predicting psychological states during LLM training."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a novel latent embedding module trained on clinical interview transcripts and distress-related text as an auxiliary signal to detect and mitigate biases in LLMs. However, the mechanism by which these latent distress embeddings integrate with existing LLM architectures and influence bias mitigation is under-specified. Clarification is needed on how the auxiliary embeddings interact with the LLM’s internal layers during fine-tuning, and how the model distinguishes between clinical distress indicators and general linguistic variation to avoid confounding errors. Additionally, explaining how the embeddings quantitatively contribute to fairness improvements beyond detection—e.g., via specific mitigation techniques—is essential to establish methodological soundness and reproducibility. Without this, the technical feasibility and validity of the approach remain too abstract for rigorous evaluation or practical implementation. Please provide detailed architectural diagrams or pseudocode and elaborate on training objectives linking the distress embeddings to fairness outcomes in social media analysis tasks, especially sentiment classification under clinical subgroup shifts."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the socially critical domain, enhancing the idea's impact and distinctiveness could be achieved by explicitly integrating legal and ethical frameworks related to mental health and AI fairness, such as the Artificial Intelligence Act, Digital Services Act, and relevant human rights law. For example, embedding compliance constraints or auditing mechanisms aligned with these laws directly into the fairness evaluation pipeline can broaden the scope beyond technical bias mitigation to policy-aware AI deployment. Additionally, connecting the latent embedding approach to suicide prevention and public health solutions could unlock multidisciplinary collaborations and elevate societal impact. Suggest extending the Experiment_Plan to include user studies evaluating interpretability and trustworthiness of model outputs for vulnerable groups, and situating results in the context of digital mental health rights and legal duty frameworks. This integration will differentiate the work and align it with critical efforts in responsible AI and health solution regulation."
