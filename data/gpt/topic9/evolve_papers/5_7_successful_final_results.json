        "title": "CrossDisciplinaryFairnessExplainer",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current bias mitigation techniques often lack transparent and explainable connections between AI-driven decisions and the multifaceted psychological, clinical, and socio-economic factors influencing human-centered fairness assessments. Without clear mechanistic integration of these interdisciplinary attributes, fairness explanations remain abstract, limiting stakeholder trust and actionable insights.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work in bias mitigation and explainability has advanced post-hoc interpretation methods, few have systematically integrated interdisciplinary human-centric features—spanning psychological distress, clinical indicators, and socio-economic context—to provide explanations that are both meaningful and actionable to domain experts and end-users. Our approach innovatively unites interdisciplinary knowledge with large language model (LLM) decision outputs through a novel joint modeling architecture, offering richer explanatory granularity and interpretability. This integration advances beyond typical surrogate or rule-based explainers by embedding domain-specific semantics within a learned, data-driven framework, thereby overcoming the novelty and interpretability limitations observed in existing methods.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular, neural post-hoc explainer architecture comprising three interconnected components: (1) an input alignment encoder that jointly processes LLM decision embeddings and human-labeled interdisciplinary feature vectors (derived from psychological, clinical, and socio-economic datasets), ensuring shared latent representation space; (2) an interpretable attention-based attribution network that learns to associate LLM outputs with discrete human-centric feature contributions, employing multi-task objectives that optimize explanation fidelity and semantic alignment; and (3) a cross-modal consistency regularizer enforcing the concordance between textual model rationale and interdisciplinary feature signals. Specifically, the explainer receives as input the LLM output logits or embeddings along with corresponding feature-tagged text segments. The joint training procedure leverages paired supervised data where each example couples LLM predictions with human-annotated, interdisciplinary feature tags (e.g., psychological distress markers, socio-economic indicators). The learning objective combines (a) an explanation fidelity loss measuring how well the explainer reconstructs LLM decisions from the interdisciplinary features, (b) a semantic alignment loss ensuring explainability outputs are interpretable by domain experts, and (c) a sparsity constraint promoting concise attributions. This architecture is modular and flexible, enabling integration as a standalone post-hoc model or an auxiliary module fine-tuned alongside the LLM. The outputs are human-readable explanation vectors highlighting the influence of meaningful interdisciplinary features on the model’s decisions, facilitating transparent fairness audits across psychological, clinical, and socio-economic dimensions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Assembly: Aggregate and preprocess publicly available datasets such as the Dreaddit and Social Bias Frames corpora for psychological distress and socio-economic context annotations, alongside clinical notes datasets capturing mental health indicators. Curate and label text samples with standardized interdisciplinary features (e.g., distress cues, socio-economic status tags) using a combination of automated heuristics and manual review, targeting a balanced and representative dataset of at least 10,000 annotated instances.\n2) Model Implementation & Training: Develop the proposed explainer architecture, implementing input alignment encoder, attention-based attribution network, and cross-modal consistency module. Train the explainer jointly on paired LLM outputs and interdisciplinary annotations with multi-task loss functions outlined above.\n3) Domain Expert Validation: Recruit a panel of 5-7 experts specializing in psychology, clinical mental health, and socio-economic research. Conduct qualitative assessment sessions where experts evaluate explanation saliency, interpretability, and alignment with domain knowledge, using a standardized rubric and think-aloud protocols.\n4) Quantitative Evaluation: Employ metrics such as explanation fidelity (e.g., how well explanations reproduce model decisions), sparsity, and attention interpretability scores. Execute controlled user studies with 30+ participants to measure impacts on trust, fairness perception, and decision understanding using Likert-scale surveys and behavioral tasks.\n5) Iterative Refinement: Based on expert feedback and quantitative results, refine annotation protocols, model hyperparameters, and explanation presentation formats.\n6) Reproducibility and Robustness Checks: Validate the approach on external datasets and alternate LLM architectures to demonstrate generalizability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: A social media post flagged for toxicity containing language potentially indicative of psychological distress and socio-economic hardship.\nExample Output Explanation: The explainer highlights that the LLM's toxicity prediction was influenced notably by linguistic distress indicators (e.g., expressions of anxiety and isolation) weighted at 0.35, alongside socio-economic hardship signals (e.g., references to unemployment) weighted at 0.28, while clinical symptomatology cues had a smaller contribution. This explanation facilitates understanding how specific interdisciplinary factors modulate fairness adjustments in the toxicity model predictions.\nAdditional Case: Clinical triage chatbot responses where explanations reveal the extent to which socio-economic and psychological features drive the model's risk stratification.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should the joint training approach encounter integration challenges (e.g., insufficient alignment between LLM outputs and interdisciplinary features), we will pivot to a two-stage approach: first, develop independent surrogate models trained exclusively on interdisciplinary features to approximate LLM decisions; second, employ rule-based explanation frameworks informed by expert-curated interdisciplinary feature sets to generate interpretable explanations. We will also explore probabilistic graphical models that explicitly model dependencies between LLM decisions and human-centric features, providing an alternative explanation mechanism. Throughout, we will maintain rigorous empirical validation and expert feedback to ensure explanatory relevance and credibility."

Clarify the architecture and learning objectives, specify the nature of inputs and outputs, and explain how interdisciplinary features will be effectively connected to model decisions to produce valid, interpretable explanations. This mechanistic clarity is critical for convincing reviewers of the soundness of the approach and for successful implementation and evaluation phases. For example, will the explainer model be a separate module, a neural network, or a probabilistic model? How will the training pipeline ensure alignment between the various data modalities and the LLM's decisions? Addressing these points will strengthen the methodological robustness and reproducibility of the proposal.
