    "title": "Integrating Patient-Reported Outcome Measures into Real-Time LLM Dialogue Personalization",
    "Problem_Statement": "Real-time healthcare conversational AI rarely incorporates patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) such as quality of life or psychological distress into personalized interactions, reducing clinical relevance and patient-centered care.",
    "Motivation": "This proposal fills an identified external gap by synthesizing patient experience research (‘entertainment’ and ‘research domain’ bridge) with conversational AI personalization, advancing novel real-time incorporation of PROM data into dialogue management for improved outcomes and engagement.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a PROM-aware dialogue management module that dynamically adjusts conversation strategies based on structured PROM inputs collected before and during interactions. Use multi-task learning to predict latent psychological states from text and PROMs, optimizing dialogue flow, topic selection, and language style to support patient needs effectively.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect paired datasets of healthcare dialogues with PROM annotations.\n2. Train multitask neural networks to jointly model PROM prediction and response generation.\n3. Implement real-time dialogue management conditioned on PROM values.\n4. Compare model variants against PROM-agnostic baselines on measures of patient satisfaction, engagement, and clinical proxy outcomes.\n5. Validate in simulated clinical environments and, if feasible, piloted patient studies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient reports high fatigue and low mood scores previously.\nExpected output: Agent selects empathetic topics, offers supportive resources, and adjusts pacing to accommodate patient state, improving perceived care quality.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If PROM integration reduces dialogue naturalness, refine model balancing between PROM conditioning and conversational coherence. Alternatively, explore delayed or batch PROM incorporation at session endpoints."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed experiment plan, while logically sequential, lacks detail on how to collect or access sufficiently large and representative paired datasets of healthcare dialogues with PROM annotations. Given the sensitivity and variability of clinical data, there should be clearer considerations for data privacy, annotation protocols, and the heterogeneity of PROM instruments across conditions. Furthermore, the step of 'real-time dialogue management conditioned on PROM values' needs elaboration on latency constraints, deployment environment, and integration with existing healthcare systems to assess practical feasibility. Addressing these aspects will strengthen confidence in the plan's scientific rigor and practical implementability, ensuring smoother transitioning from simulation to pilot studies in clinical contexts.\n\nConsider augmenting the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan with explicit strategies for dataset acquisition, ethical approval processes, and technical system integration challenges to validate the plan’s feasibility comprehensively and realistically within clinical settings, especially when targeting diverse patient populations and modes of PROM administration (e.g., asynchronous vs. real-time). The fallback plan should also more explicitly include contingencies related to deployment barriers and user acceptance metrics beyond dialogue naturalness alone.\n\nTarget section: Experiment_Plan."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and the project's inherently interdisciplinary scope, a concrete way to enhance both impact and novelty is to integrate modality or domain-specific PROM signals with conversational context adaptation. For example, extending the approach to multimodal conversational agents that incorporate voice interaction capabilities tailored to complex health needs or underserved communities could significantly broaden relevance and clinical uptake. Leveraging existing validated instruments such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 or Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 alongside text inputs, and incorporating behavior change frameworks or caregiver burden assessments, could create synergy with global chronic disease management efforts and mental health services.\n\nFurther, integrating insights from qualitative study designs on health information seeking patterns can improve dialogue personalization strategies, making the system more patient-centered and responsive to underserved or high-risk populations. Embedding these globally-linked concepts could differentiate the proposal by positioning it at the interface of machine learning, person-centered care, and practical healthcare delivery enhancements, ultimately amplifying translational impact and novelty in a competitive field.\n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method."
