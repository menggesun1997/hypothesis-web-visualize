    "title": "SocioEcon-ContextualLLM-Fairness",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM bias mitigation overlooks socio-economic and behavioral context, limiting fairness in social media text analysis.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to the external gap linking AI research with commerce, marketing, and social exchange theories, proposing socio-economic awareness in fairness models — a novel cross-disciplinary fusion.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a socio-economic context-aware LLM framework integrating data on user behavioral intentions and social exchange metrics. This model layers context embeddings derived from commerce and marketing theories onto text representations to adjust bias mitigation dynamically based on user socio-economic factors.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Create or acquire datasets mapping social media text to socio-economic and behavioral intent labels. 2) Train embedding modules capturing social exchange theory features. 3) Integrate with LLMs for bias mitigation reevaluation. 4) Evaluate fairness improvements on socio-demographically diverse test sets, analyzing bias across income, education, and cultural groups.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Social media post advertising a financial product to diverse demographics. Output: Model identifies and corrects for bias that would undervalue certain groups’ perspectives, ensuring fair sentiment and intent interpretation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct socio-economic embeddings underperform, incorporate proxy features such as geolocation or browsing history, or leverage multi-task learning with behavioral prediction tasks."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan relies heavily on acquiring or creating datasets that accurately map social media text to socio-economic and behavioral intent labels, which is a non-trivial challenge given privacy, data availability, and annotation complexity. The proposal lacks a clear strategy for how these datasets will be sourced or constructed with sufficient scale and diversity, which critically affects feasibility. It is recommended to elaborate on the data acquisition plan, including potential partnerships, use of synthetic data, or semi-supervised methods to mitigate data scarcity and annotation burden, ensuring the experiment plan is practically achievable and scientifically rigorous as a foundation for the proposed framework's validation phase. Furthermore, consider validating proxy signals early to avoid costly late-stage failure if primary socio-economic embedding approaches underperform, improving risk management in the experimental pipeline.\n\nAlso, the integration step and evaluation metrics could be more concretely outlined to establish clearer criteria for success and reproducibility of fairness improvements across socio-demographic groups, which will strengthen feasibility and methodological soundness for a competitive environment like ACL or NeurIPS conferences.\n\nIn summary, the experimental section requires greater specificity and pragmatic risk mitigation to confidently validate the proposed method's effectiveness and enable reproducible, impactful results."

          "feedback_content": "Given the competitive novelty assessment and the globally-linked concept of 'artificial general intelligence' (AGI), the idea can be significantly strengthened by framing the socio-economic context-aware fairness modeling within a broader quest for more generalizable, human-aligned reasoning in LLMs. Specifically, propose how integrating socio-economic and behavioral context embeddings could serve as a stepping stone toward incorporating real-world, multi-modal, and long-term social understanding—a core challenge in AGI development. This reframing can elevate the impact and novelty by connecting the fairness model to larger questions about AI systems’ social cognition and adaptability across domains. Such a perspective encourages cross-disciplinary collaboration with AGI research communities and may reveal novel evaluation dimensions or training objectives that push beyond standard bias mitigation toward more holistic social intelligence in language models, making the contribution stand out in a crowded field."
