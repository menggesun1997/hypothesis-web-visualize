    "title": "Multimodal Legal XAI With Biomedical Contrastive Learning",
    "Problem_Statement": "Legal XAI methods inadequately utilize powerful contrastive learning techniques developed in biomedical ontology annotation, limiting explanation robustness across varied document modalities.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses external gap by adapting contrastive learning from biomedical complex semantic inference, achieving multimodal legal explanations combining text and imagery (e.g., scanned documents, diagrams) with domain-aware alignment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a contrastive multimodal explanation model that jointly learns aligned embeddings of legal text and associated visual elements guided by hierarchical ontologies. The model contrasts positive legal concept pairs across modalities versus negatives, refining cross-modal representations. Explanations highlight aligned elements evidencing decisions, improving trustworthiness.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Gather dataset of legal documents with annotated textual and visual elements; (2) Pretrain text and image encoders with contrastive loss incorporating legal ontological constraints; (3) Fine-tune joint embeddings for explanation tasks; (4) Evaluate on multimodal explanation quality metrics and user trust studies; (5) Benchmark against unimodal XAI approaches.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Contract page with relevant clauses and signature images. Output: Explanation pointing to textual clause and visual signature alignment, clarifying contract validity assessment.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cross-modal contrastive training is ineffective, focus on unimodal legal text embeddings enhanced with contrastive losses on legal concept annotations."

          "feedback_content": "The outlined Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks critical detail regarding dataset construction and annotation, which is a complex and resource-intensive aspect for legal multimodal data involving both textual and visual elements. The plan should explicitly describe how legal visual annotations (e.g., diagram semantics, signature verification) will be sourced or created, addressing known challenges in multimodal legal datasets. Additionally, the evaluation methods, especially user trust studies, need more concrete design details to assess impact rigorously. Without these specifics, the feasibility of the proposed method and the practical steps to demonstrate its effectiveness remain uncertain. Enhancing this section with realistic timelines, annotation protocols, and evaluation metrics will strengthen confidence in execution viability and reproducibility, which are crucial for a high-impact study in this interdisciplinary niche areas where data scarcity and complexity are major hurdles, making this feedback critical to address first.  Targeting this will also help mitigate risks announced in the fallback plan scenarios, ensuring a smoother path towards meaningful results and potentially higher novelty in application domains beyond unimodal legal text explanation alone.

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screened novelty status of NOV-COMPETITIVE, the idea could substantially benefit by integrating concepts from 'federated intelligence' or 'semantic interoperability' into the multimodal legal XAI framework. For example, applying federated learning principles could enable leveraging heterogeneous legal datasets across jurisdictions without compromising privacy, thus enhancing scalability and generalizability of the contrastive learning approach. Alternatively, explicitly incorporating semantic interoperability frameworks could strengthen the alignment of hierarchical ontologies across modalities and legal subdomains, increasing robustness and transferability of explanations. This integration could significantly broaden the impact and novelty by tackling real-world legal deployment challenges, pushing the work beyond a mere technical adaptation of biomedical contrastive learning and addressing broader AI trust and applicability concerns in the legal domain. Pursuing this could also enable downstream task improvements and greater cross-disciplinary influence, placing the work at the frontier of both legal AI and trustworthy multimodal explainability research.
