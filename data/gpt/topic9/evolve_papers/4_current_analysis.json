Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a subset of AI that have emerged as a powerful tool for various tasks including image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and even in the field of genomics, where they have been utilized to classify DNA sequences. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of CNNs and their applications in image recognition tasks. It first introduces the fundamentals of CNNs, including the layers of CNNs, convolution operation (Conv_Op), Feat_Maps, activation functions (Activ_Func), and training methods. It then discusses several popular CNN architectures such as LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, and InceptionNet, and compares their performance. It also examines when to use CNNs, their advantages and limitations, and provides recommendations for developers and data scientists, including preprocessing the data, choosing appropriate hyperparameters (Hyper_Param), and evaluating model performance. It further explores the existing platforms and libraries for CNNs such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Caffe, and MXNet, and compares their features and functionalities. Moreover, it estimates the cost of using CNNs and discusses potential cost-saving strategies. Finally, it reviews recent developments in CNNs, including attention mechanisms, capsule networks, transfer learning, adversarial training, quantization and compression, and enhancing the reliability and efficiency of CNNs through formal methods.

With the emergence of computer vision applications, there is a significant demand to recognize objects automatically. Deep CNN (convolution neural network) has benefited the computer vision community by producing excellent results in video processing, object recognition, picture classification and segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and many other fields. Furthermore, the introduction of large amounts of data and readily available hardware has opened new avenues for CNN study. Several inspirational concepts for the progress of CNN have been investigated, including alternative activation functions, regularization, parameter optimization, and architectural advances. Furthermore, achieving innovations in architecture results in a tremendous enhancement in the capacity of the deep CNN. Significant emphasis has been given to leveraging channel and spatial information, with a depth of architecture and information processing via multi-path. This survey paper focuses mainly on the primary taxonomy and newly released deep CNN architectures, and it divides numerous recent developments in CNN architectures into eight groups. Spatial exploitation, multi-path, depth, breadth, dimension, channel boosting, feature-map exploitation, and attention-based CNN are the eight categories. The main contribution of this manuscript is in comparing various architectural evolutions in CNN by its architectural change, strengths, and weaknesses.

In order to boost the representational power of a network, several recent approaches have shown the benefit of enhancing spatial encoding. In this work, we focus on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the “Squeeze-and-Excitation” (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We demonstrate that by stacking these blocks together, we can construct SENet architectures that generalise extremely well across challenging datasets. Crucially, we find that SE blocks produce significant performance improvements for existing state-of-the-art deep architectures at minimal additional computational cost. SENets formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and significantly reduced the top-5 error to 2.251%, achieving a ∼25% relative improvement over the winning entry of 2016.

One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question: Are there any benefits to combining Inception architectures with residual connections? Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4 networks, we achieve 3.08% top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Deep Transfer Learning Approaches in Performance Analysis of Brain Tumor Classification Using MRI Images', 'abstract': 'Brain tumor classification is a very important and the most prominent step for assessing life-threatening abnormal tissues and providing an efficient treatment in patient recovery. To identify pathological conditions in the brain, there exist various medical imaging technologies. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is extensively used in medical imaging due to its excellent image quality and independence from ionizing radiations. The significance of deep learning, a subset of artificial intelligence in the area of medical diagnosis applications, has macadamized the path in rapid developments for brain tumor detection from MRI to higher prediction rate.

Pretrained models are demonstrated on the MRI brain tumor images dataset consisting of 233 images. Our paper aims to locate brain tumors with the utilization of the VGG-16 pretrained CNN model. The performance of our model will be evaluated on accuracy.

This paper focuses on a 3-class classification problem to differentiate among glioma, meningioma and pituitary tumors, which form three prominent types of brain tumor. The proposed classification system adopts the concept of deep transfer learning and uses a pre-trained GoogLeNet to extract features from brain MRI images. Proven classifier models are integrated to classify the extracted features. The experiment follows a patient-level five-fold cross-validation process, on MRI dataset from figshare. The proposed system records a mean classification accuracy of 98%, outperforming all state-of-the-art methods. Other performance measures used in the study are the area under the curve (AUC), precision, recall, F-score and specificity.

The computer-aided tumor detection systems and convolutional neural networks provided success stories and have made important strides in the field of machine learning. The deep convolutional layers extract important and robust features automatically from the input space as compared to traditional predecessor neural network layers. In the proposed framework, we conduct three studies using three architectures of convolutional neural networks (AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and VGGNet) to classify brain tumors such as meningioma, glioma, and pituitary. Each study then explores the transfer learning techniques, i.e., fine-tune and freeze using MRI slices of brain tumor dataset—Figshare.

Most of the previous studies have encountered many constraints, such as restricted scenarios and strict inputs. To solve this problem, we present a simple yet effective HPE network called limb direction cues (LDCs) aware network (LDCNet) with LDCs and differentiated Cauchy labels, which can efficiently suppress uncertainties and prevent deep networks from over-fitting uncertain keypoint positions. In particular, LDCNet suppresses the uncertainties from two aspects. First, a differentiated Cauchy coordinate encoding method is designed to reveal the limb direction information among adjacent keypoints. Second, Jeffreys divergence is introduced as loss function to measure the prediction heatmap and ground-truth one. Positions of keypoints are perceived at the limb direction based deep network in an end-to-end manner. An extensive study on two benchmark datasets (i.e., MS COCO and MPII) illustrates the superiority of the proposed LDCNet model over state-of-the-art approaches.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition', 'abstract': 'Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers-8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity.

The dominant methodology builds on the development of varied CNN architectures — including multi-path, deep, and efficient variants such as residual networks and squeeze-and-excitation blocks — which have collectively enhanced model representational power while controlling computational overhead. Central concepts such as 'layers of convolutional neural networks,' 'efficiency of convolutional neural networks,' and 'CNN architecture' underpin this landscape. Transfer learning and fine-tuning have become pivotal to adapting pretrained models to domain-specific tasks, such as medical image classification, reflecting a shift towards maximizing model utility with limited computation and data. The two primary thematic clusters—one focused on CNN layers and NLP, and the other on CNN variants for computer vision—reflect the intertwined progress of model architecture and application domains. This progression responds directly to earlier limitations in computational costs and model generalization, enabling increasingly efficient yet effective models suitable for deployment beyond centralized servers, towards edge and IoT devices.",
