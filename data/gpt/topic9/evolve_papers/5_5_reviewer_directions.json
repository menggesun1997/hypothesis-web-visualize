    "Proposed_Method": "Create a dual-module architecture where one module predicts user behavioral intent from text (using social exchange and marketing theories) and the other adjusts LLM output post-processing bias corrections conditioned on the inferred intent and associated socio-economic attributes.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble a dataset annotated with behavioral intent categories. 2) Train behavioral intent prediction model. 3) Integrate with LLM output adjustment module. 4) Evaluate fairness and bias metrics before and after correction across behavioral categories.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Social media post hinting at consumer skepticism towards ad campaigns. Output: Model reduces biased negative sentiment misclassification considering the consumer’s intent and respects fair treatment in text analysis.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If behavioral intent prediction is noisy, fallback to simpler categorical user segmentation or soft attention-weighted corrections based on confidence levels."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that behavioral intent can be reliably inferred and effectively used to adjust bias in LLM outputs warrants deeper grounding. Behavioral intent prediction from text is known to be noisy and dependent on strong contextual signals, which may not always be present in social texts. The proposal should provide stronger evidence or theoretical support for why integrating behavioral intent will meaningfully improve fairness beyond existing demographic or content-based bias correction methods. Clarifying how user intent is operationalized and validated will strengthen soundness and reduce risks of compounding errors in bias mitigation pipelines. This is critical before committing to the dual-module architecture design and downstream bias adjustments based on inferred intent and socio-economic attributes. Consider adding more extensive theoretical or empirical justification in the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections to address this foundational assumption explicitly and rigorously, ensuring the approach’s robustness and validity in diverse real-world scenarios with noisy user data and ambiguous intent cues. \n\n"

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating and the proposed method's domain, the research idea would significantly benefit by integrating concepts from 'cognitive behavioral therapy principles' or 'mental health support' to enrich behavioral intent modeling. These domains offer well-studied, validated frameworks explaining user motivation and behavioral patterns which can enhance intent inference fidelity. Leveraging psychological theories could improve the interpretability and generalizability of intent predictions beyond social exchange and marketing theories alone. Moreover, connecting bias correction with mental health or dementia care contexts can broaden societal impact, opening applications for fairer AI in sensitive health communication scenarios. This multidisciplinary integration could differentiate the contribution, yielding a novel AI framework that not only mitigates bias but also supports intelligent decision-making tailored to nuanced human psychological states. I recommend expanding the Motivation and Proposed_Method sections to incorporate insights or datasets from these adjacent fields, thereby boosting both novelty and impact."
