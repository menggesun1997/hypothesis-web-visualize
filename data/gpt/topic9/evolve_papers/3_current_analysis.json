Usually, it is essential to understand the reasoning behind an AI model’s decision-making. Thus, the need for eXplainable AI (XAI) methods for improving trust in AI models has arisen. XAI has become a popular research subject within the AI field in recent years. Existing survey papers have tackled the concepts of XAI, its general terms, and post-hoc explainability methods but there have not been any reviews that have looked at the assessment methods, available tools, XAI datasets, and other related aspects. Therefore, in this comprehensive study, we provide readers with an overview of the current research and trends in this rapidly emerging area with a case study example. The study starts by explaining the background of XAI, common definitions, and summarizing recently proposed techniques in XAI for supervised machine learning. The review divides XAI techniques into four axes using a hierarchical categorization system: (i) data explainability, (ii) model explainability, (iii) post-hoc explainability, and (iv) assessment of explanations. We also introduce available evaluation metrics as well as open-source packages and datasets with future research directions. Then, the significance of explainability in terms of legal demands, user viewpoints, and application orientation is outlined, termed as XAI concerns. This paper advocates for tailoring explanation content to specific user types. An examination of XAI techniques and evaluation was conducted by looking at 410 critical articles, published between January 2016 and October 2022, in reputed journals and using a wide range of research databases as a source of information. The article is aimed at XAI researchers who are interested in making their AI models more trustworthy, as well as towards researchers from other disciplines who are looking for effective XAI methods to complete tasks with confidence while communicating meaning from data.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models', 'abstract': 'By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve new state of the art scores for image inpainting and class-conditional image synthesis and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, text-to-image synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database', 'abstract': 'The explosion of image data on the Internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data. But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called “ImageNet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints', 'abstract': 'This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'LabelMe: A Database and Web-Based Tool for Image Annotation', 'abstract': 'Abstract\\nWe seek to build a large collection of images with ground truth labels to be used for object detection and recognition research. Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks', 'abstract': 'We investigate conditional adversarial networks as a general-purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems. These networks not only learn the mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Moreover, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, hundreds of twitter users have posted their own artistic experiments using our system. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Image Quality Assessment: From Error Visibility to Structural Similarity', 'abstract': 'Objective methods for assessing perceptual image quality traditionally attempted to quantify the visibility of errors (differences) between a distorted image and a reference image using a variety of known properties of the human visual system. Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept, we develop a Structural Similarity Index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation', 'abstract': 'Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build “fully convolutional” networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet [20]), the VGG net [1], and GoogLeNet [2]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning [3] to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20% relative improvement to 62.2% mean IV on 2012), NYVDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Interpretable deep learning: interpretation, interpretability, trustworthiness, and beyond', 'abstract': 'Deep neural networks have been well-known for their superb handling of various machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks. However, due to their over-parameterized black-box nature, it is often difficult to understand the prediction results of deep models. In recent years, many interpretation tools have been proposed to explain or reveal how deep models make decisions. In this paper, we review this line of research and try to make a comprehensive survey. Specifically, we first introduce and clarify two basic concepts—interpretations and interpretability—that people usually get confused about. To address the research efforts in interpretations, we elaborate the designs of a number of interpretation algorithms, from different perspectives, by proposing a new taxonomy. Then, to understand the interpretation results, we also survey the performance metrics for evaluating interpretation algorithms. Further, we summarize the current works in evaluating models’ interpretability using “trustworthy” interpretation algorithms. Finally, we review and discuss the connections between deep models’ interpretations and other factors, such as adversarial robustness and learning from interpretations, and we introduce several open-source libraries for interpretation algorithms and evaluation approaches.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold', 'abstract': 'Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1, 2, 3–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50\\xa0years9. Despite recent progress10, 11, 12, 13–14, existing methods fall far\\xa0short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.'}]\n```\n\n**Part A.2: The Evolution Links (Edges of the Graph):**\nThe following list defines the citation relationships between the papers in Part A.

    "title": "Landscape Map for Enhancing Explainability of Large Language Models in Legal Document Analysis",
    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem in the current research landscape revolves around enhancing explainability and trustworthiness of AI models, particularly applied to complex domains such as legal document analysis. Building on early foundational work in AI explainability and interpretability, the dominant methodology has evolved towards integrating eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques that provide transparent, user-tailored explanations of AI decision processes. The research trajectory reflects a clear shift from general model and post-hoc explainability methods towards application-specific XAI frameworks that accommodate legal domain constraints and user trust requirements. Central conceptual pillars include large-scale ontologies, supervised learning on semantic hierarchies (such as those exemplified by WordNet and ImageNet structures), and advanced machine learning models capable of semantic annotation and synthesis. The thematic islands emphasize the integration of AI models with hierarchical knowledge representations and user-centric image/text annotation methods, illustrating parallels in explainability challenges between visual and textual domains. Thus, the current state is characterized by efforts to embed hierarchical semantic knowledge and supervision within AI architectures to improve both performance and interpretability in high-stakes applications like legal analytics.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps identified include a relative scarcity of domain-adapted XAI evaluation metrics and tools tailored specifically for legal documents. While foundational papers address XAI methods broadly, there remains insufficient focus on assessing explanation quality under legal interpretability frameworks or diverse user perspectives (e.g., judges, lawyers, clients). The evolutionary trajectory has also under-explored seamless integration of hierarchical ontologies with large language models (LLMs) for explainability, as existing works tend to treat ontology construction and model explanation extraction as separate processes. Additionally, explainability methods are often developed agnostic of the unique linguistic complexity and domain-specific semantics inherent in legal texts, leading to underutilization of domain ontologies and supervised learning annotations in the legal context. Externally, global context analysis reveals overlooked opportunities in cross-disciplinary application of biomedical and protein structure annotation techniques—methods that successfully leverage large-scale ontologies and supervised learning for highly complex semantic inference—to legal AI. Specifically, the use of knowledge graph embedding models, graph neural networks, and contrastive learning approaches prominent in biomedical domains has not yet permeated legal XAI research. Moreover, opportunities exist in incorporating zero-shot and prompt-based learning strategies from natural language processing advances into legal explainability pipelines, which remain underexplored.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "1. **Ontology-Integrated Explainable Legal LLMs:** Develop frameworks that tightly integrate large-scale, hierarchical legal ontologies (analogous to WordNet/ImageNet) within LLM architectures to enable semantically grounded, domain-aware explanations. This would address internal gaps by linking ontologies directly with model reasoning pathways, facilitating legal-compliant interpretability and enhanced user trust. It leverages global insights on ontology and supervised learning synergies.\n\n2. **Cross-Domain Knowledge Graph Embedding for Legal Explainability:** Adapt graph embedding models and graph neural network techniques from biomedical and protein function annotation fields to represent and reason over legal knowledge graphs. Such methods can enable richer, structural explanation generation that reflects complex interrelations in legal documents, fulfilling the unmet need for structured interpretability and bridging internal-external gaps.\n\n3. **User-Centric, Multi-Perspective Evaluation Metrics and Tools:** Innovate novel XAI evaluation approaches specifically tailored to legal stakeholder needs (e.g., legal experts, clients), inspired by trustworthiness and interpretability metrics from other domains but adapted for legal context complexity. Incorporation of human-in-the-loop and minimal supervision methods can ensure scalable, contextual explanation assessment, addressing current evaluation deficits and leveraging minimal supervision concepts identified as bridge nodes."
