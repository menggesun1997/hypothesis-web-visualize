    "title": "Dual-Stream Reinforcement Learning for Balancing Clinical Accuracy and Conversational Engagement",
    "Problem_Statement": "Healthcare LLM conversational agents struggle to simultaneously maintain clinical accuracy and engaging, entertaining dialogue flow, often treating these objectives independently leading to suboptimal patient outcomes.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by the hidden bridge between ‘entertainment’ and ‘research domain’, this project addresses the internal gap in integrating conversational AI capabilities with clinical domain expertise, proposing a novel multi-objective learning framework combining these traditionally disparate goals.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a dual-stream reinforcement learning architecture where one stream optimizes clinical factual correctness using medical knowledge bases and outcome proxies, while the other maximizes patient engagement metrics drawn from entertainment AI analytics (such as dialogue richness, humor, and empathy). A gating mechanism dynamically balances policy outputs based on patient state and session context.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop simulators providing separate reward signals for clinical accuracy and engagement.\n2. Train dual-stream RL agents and compare to single-objective baselines.\n3. Evaluate performance on real and synthetic healthcare conversational datasets.\n4. Measure trade-offs and patient outcome proxies in controlled studies.\n5. Refine the gating mechanism adapting to user feedback.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient presents complex symptom queries with rising anxiety.\nExpected output: Agent prioritizes accurate information delivery while sustaining engaging supportive dialogue, dynamically modulating tone and depth to maintain trust and comprehension.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If balancing objectives proves unstable, experiment with curriculum learning starting with single objectives and progressively combining them. Alternatively, model multi-objective policies as Pareto fronts for explicit trade-off analysis."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed dual-stream reinforcement learning method is conceptually intriguing but lacks detailed explanation of key components, especially the gating mechanism that dynamically balances clinical accuracy and engagement streams. Clarify how the gating mechanism will integrate patient state and session context quantitatively, and how conflicting objectives will be resolved in real-time. Also, elaborate on how medical knowledge bases and entertainment AI analytics concretely inform reward design to ensure stable and meaningful joint learning outcomes. Without this clarity, reproducibility and validity of the approach remain questionable, impeding rigorous evaluation and adoption in clinical settings, which have very high accuracy demands alongside sensitive patient interactions. Address these points by providing algorithmic details, theoretical motivations, and anticipated failure modes of the dual-stream framework to bolster soundness and transparency in your methodology section (Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty is rated as NOV-COMPETITIVE, consider explicitly integrating multi-turn interaction modeling techniques to improve dialogue coherence and patient trust across longer sessions, which is critical for clinical conversational agents. Additionally, to broaden impact and applicability, explore linking with internationally recognized health or nutritional bodies such as the International Union of Nutritional Sciences to incorporate domain-specific nutritional guidance within the engagement-accuracy framework. This external domain integration could enrich the clinical knowledge base and enhance user experience with personalized, contextually relevant content, setting your work apart from existing approaches by combining multi-turn engagement and global health standards. Such integration would also provide richer evaluation benchmarks and real-world deployment pathways, substantially boosting both novelty and impact of the research."
