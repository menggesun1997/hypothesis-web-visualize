    "title": "Integrating Patient-Reported Outcome Measures into Real-Time LLM Dialogue Personalization",
    "Problem_Statement": "Real-time healthcare conversational AI rarely incorporates patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) such as quality of life or psychological distress into personalized interactions, reducing clinical relevance and patient-centered care.",
    "Motivation": "This proposal fills an identified external gap by synthesizing patient experience research (‘entertainment’ and ‘research domain’ bridge) with conversational AI personalization, advancing novel real-time incorporation of PROM data into dialogue management for improved outcomes and engagement.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a PROM-aware dialogue management module that dynamically adjusts conversation strategies based on structured PROM inputs collected before and during interactions. Use multi-task learning to predict latent psychological states from text and PROMs, optimizing dialogue flow, topic selection, and language style to support patient needs effectively.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect paired datasets of healthcare dialogues with PROM annotations.\n2. Train multitask neural networks to jointly model PROM prediction and response generation.\n3. Implement real-time dialogue management conditioned on PROM values.\n4. Compare model variants against PROM-agnostic baselines on measures of patient satisfaction, engagement, and clinical proxy outcomes.\n5. Validate in simulated clinical environments and, if feasible, piloted patient studies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient reports high fatigue and low mood scores previously.\nExpected output: Agent selects empathetic topics, offers supportive resources, and adjusts pacing to accommodate patient state, improving perceived care quality.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If PROM integration reduces dialogue naturalness, refine model balancing between PROM conditioning and conversational coherence. Alternatively, explore delayed or batch PROM incorporation at session endpoints."

        "title": "Integrating Multimodal Patient-Reported Outcome Measures into Real-Time Personalized Healthcare Conversational Agents for Diverse Clinical Contexts",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current healthcare conversational AI systems seldom incorporate comprehensive patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), including standardized psychological assessments and multimodal inputs such as voice and text, into real-time personalized dialogue management. This gap limits the systems' ability to provide patient-centered, clinically relevant interactions especially across diverse conditions and underserved populations.",
        "Motivation": "While previous work has explored incorporating PROMs into conversational AI, this project addresses the novel challenge of real-time integration of multimodal PROM signals—combining validated instruments like PHQ-9 and GAD-7 with conversational context and voice features—to dynamically personalize dialogue strategies in complex healthcare settings. This approach bridges machine learning, person-centered care, and clinical delivery, targeting chronic disease management and mental health services in underserved communities. By embedding qualitative insights on health information seeking and caregiver burden, the proposal advances state-of-the-art in personalized, multimodal healthcare conversational agents with greater translational impact, setting it apart from existing research.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We will develop a multimodal PROM-aware dialogue management system that fuses structured PROM data (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7, Zarit Burden Interview) collected asynchronously and in real-time via text and voice inputs, along with conversational context and behavioral indicators, to optimize dialogue strategies tailored to patient needs and cultural contexts. The model will use multi-task learning to jointly predict latent psychological states and behavioral readiness, adapting pacing, topic selection, empathy level, and health behavior change prompts accordingly. Integration of voice interaction capabilities will enhance accessibility for underserved populations, while embedding qualitative study findings on health information seeking patterns will refine personalization heuristics. Technical design will emphasize low-latency processing and seamless integration with healthcare IT environments, ensuring deployment feasibility in pediatric and adult outpatient settings addressing chronic disease and mental health management.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Secure ethical approvals and establish partnerships for accessing existing large-scale, de-identified healthcare dialogue datasets with PROM annotations, supplemented by data collection protocols to capture new multimodal PROM data respecting privacy and heterogeneity across conditions.\n2. Design standardized annotation schemas for PROMs across multiple validated scales and modalities, and incorporate caregiver burden and health information seeking variables.\n3. Develop and train multimodal multi-task neural models combining text and voice inputs to predict PROM scores and latent psychological/behavioral states.\n4. Engineer a low-latency, modular dialogue management system that dynamically incorporates PROM-informed personalization during live interactions.\n5. Evaluate model variants against PROM-agnostic baselines on clinical proxy outcomes (e.g., patient engagement, satisfaction) and system metrics (latency, robustness) in simulated and real clinical scenarios.\n6. Conduct pilot studies in diverse clinical environments, including pediatric academic medical centers and community health settings, assessing usability, acceptance, and impact especially among underserved groups.\n7. Use quantitative and qualitative methods to refine models iteratively, focusing on ethical considerations, data privacy, deployment challenges, and emergent user needs.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A young childhood cancer survivor reports moderate depression symptoms via PHQ-9 and exhibits vocal signs of distress during voice interaction.\nExpected output: The conversational agent adapts by selecting empathetic language, integrating supportive resources tailored to pediatric oncology survivors, adjusting pacing to reduce cognitive load, and promoting appropriate health behavior changes with caregiver engagement prompts.\n\nInput: An adult patient with chronic non-communicable disease indicates high caregiver burden on Zarit Burden Interview and low anxiety on GAD-7.\nExpected output: The agent addresses caregiver stress by suggesting caregiver support resources, monitors engagement levels via voice sentiment cues, and delivers personalized motivational interviewing techniques to facilitate chronic disease management adherence.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time multimodal PROM integration compromises dialogue naturalness or system responsiveness, we will recalibrate the weighting between PROM conditioning and conversational coherence, including adaptive buffering strategies for asynchronous PROM incorporation. We will also develop scalable deployment pipelines that allow modular integration of PROMs depending on clinical context and user preference. User acceptance metrics extending beyond dialogue naturalness, such as trust, perceived usefulness, and cultural appropriateness, will guide iterative adjustments. Should deployment barriers arise, fallback includes piloting in simulated environments with proxy data and incremental real-world trials emphasizing underserved population engagement, ensuring ethical compliance and privacy safeguards throughout."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed experiment plan, while logically sequential, lacks detail on how to collect or access sufficiently large and representative paired datasets of healthcare dialogues with PROM annotations. Given the sensitivity and variability of clinical data, there should be clearer considerations for data privacy, annotation protocols, and the heterogeneity of PROM instruments across conditions. Furthermore, the step of 'real-time dialogue management conditioned on PROM values' needs elaboration on latency constraints, deployment environment, and integration with existing healthcare systems to assess practical feasibility. Addressing these aspects will strengthen confidence in the plan's scientific rigor and practical implementability, ensuring smoother transitioning from simulation to pilot studies in clinical contexts.\n\nConsider augmenting the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan with explicit strategies for dataset acquisition, ethical approval processes, and technical system integration challenges to validate the plan’s feasibility comprehensively and realistically within clinical settings, especially when targeting diverse patient populations and modes of PROM administration (e.g., asynchronous vs. real-time). The fallback plan should also more explicitly include contingencies related to deployment barriers and user acceptance metrics beyond dialogue naturalness alone.\n\nTarget section: Experiment_Plan."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and the project's inherently interdisciplinary scope, a concrete way to enhance both impact and novelty is to integrate modality or domain-specific PROM signals with conversational context adaptation. For example, extending the approach to multimodal conversational agents that incorporate voice interaction capabilities tailored to complex health needs or underserved communities could significantly broaden relevance and clinical uptake. Leveraging existing validated instruments such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 or Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 alongside text inputs, and incorporating behavior change frameworks or caregiver burden assessments, could create synergy with global chronic disease management efforts and mental health services.\n\nFurther, integrating insights from qualitative study designs on health information seeking patterns can improve dialogue personalization strategies, making the system more patient-centered and responsive to underserved or high-risk populations. Embedding these globally-linked concepts could differentiate the proposal by positioning it at the interface of machine learning, person-centered care, and practical healthcare delivery enhancements, ultimately amplifying translational impact and novelty in a competitive field.\n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method."
