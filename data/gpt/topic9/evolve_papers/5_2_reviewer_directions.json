    "title": "PrivacyAdaptiveReinforcedFairnessAI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Bias mitigation frameworks relying on private data lack reproducibility and generalizability in dynamic social media contexts under privacy constraints.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap on private data reliance, creating adaptive reinforcement learning approaches that optimize fairness while preserving privacy â€” an innovation bridging ethics and domain adaptability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a reinforcement learning system with privacy-preserving mechanisms (e.g., differential privacy, federated learning) that dynamically adapts to shifting social media demographics and context changes, optimizing bias mitigation policies in real-time with explainability components.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement federated learning with multiple social media datasets partitioned by demographics. 2) Integrate differential privacy to protect data during training. 3) Develop a RL agent that iteratively updates bias mitigation strategies with fairness-aware reward signals. 4) Benchmark against static bias mitigation methods across demographics and time shifts.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Streaming social media data from a changing user base. Output: The model maintains stable fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) while preserving data privacy, showing adaptive bias correction over time.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "In case RL training is unstable, fallback to supervised domain adaptation with privacy guarantees or incorporate offline policy evaluation methods before online updates."
