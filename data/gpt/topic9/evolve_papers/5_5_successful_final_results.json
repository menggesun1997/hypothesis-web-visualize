        "title": "BehaviorIntentDrivenBiasCorrectionEnhanced",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing bias mitigation approaches for large language models (LLMs) typically leverage demographic or content-based features but largely overlook the nuanced and context-dependent nature of user behavioral intent, particularly in social text analysis. Inferring behavioral intent from text is inherently noisy and context-sensitive, with ambiguity and varied socio-economic backgrounds complicating reliable detection. However, integrating well-founded theoretical frameworks from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mental health support literature alongside social exchange and marketing theories offers a promising avenue to ground behavioral intent inference robustly. By systematically operationalizing and validating intent through these multi-disciplinary perspectives, bias correction can become more adaptive and personalized, especially in sensitive communication domains such as mental health and dementia care. This research proposes to rigorously examine and validate the assumption that behavioral intent, inferred through enriched psychological and social theories, can effectively enhance fairness adjustments beyond traditional demographic or content-based methods, thereby ensuring robustness in diverse real-world, noisy, and ambiguous textual contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the NOV-COMPETITIVE challenge requires a fundamentally novel integration of psychological theories with AI fairness methods for LLMs. Inspired by cognitive behavioral therapy principles and mental health support frameworks, this research aims to enrich behavioral intent modeling with validated, interpretable constructs capturing user motivations and emotional states. This multidisciplinary approach not only advances interpretability and generalizability of intent inference but also enables bias mitigation tailored to nuanced psychological dimensions, extending impact into critical domains such as dementia care and mental health communication. By bridging AI fairness with intelligent decision-making frameworks grounded in well-studied human behavioral patterns, the proposed work sets a new direction for dynamic, context-aware bias correction that meaningfully improves fairness metrics across diverse social texts and sensitive domains.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a tripartite, integrative architecture: 1) Behavioral Intent Module utilizes a hybrid model combining social exchange and marketing theories with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles and mental health constructs to infer nuanced user intent and emotional states from text, trained on enriched datasets including mental health-related corpora to improve fidelity and interpretability; 2) Contextual Bias Adjustment Module dynamically modulates LLM output post-processing corrections using inferred behavioral intent and associated socio-economic and psychological attributes, leveraging attention mechanisms weighted by prediction confidence to mitigate noise and ambiguity; 3) Application and Evaluation Module applies this framework specifically to socially sensitive domains such as mental health support and dementia care communication. We incorporate datasets annotated with CBT-informed behavioral intent categories and user psychological profiles to rigorously operationalize intent and validate its contribution to fairness enhancements beyond traditional bias correction. This multidisciplinary integration differentiates our approach by embedding well-validated psychological theories and domain-specific insights into AI fairness pipelines to achieve superior, context-aware bias mitigation results.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect and curate a multi-domain dataset comprising social media posts, mental health support conversations, and dementia care communication, annotated for behavioral intent using combined frameworks from social, marketing, and cognitive-behavioral theories.\n2) Develop and train the Behavioral Intent Module leveraging multi-task learning to predict CBT-informed intent categories and emotional states, evaluating accuracy and interpretability.\n3) Design the Contextual Bias Adjustment Module incorporating attention-weighted corrections conditional on inferred intents and psychological attributes.\n4) Integrate modules with state-of-the-art LLMs to perform post-hoc bias correction.\n5) Conduct extensive evaluation of fairness, bias metrics, and downstream task performance across behavioral and psychological categories, comparing against baseline demographic/content-based bias correction methods.\n6) Perform robustness tests under varying text ambiguity and noise conditions.\n7) Explore case studies in mental health and dementia care contexts to demonstrate societal impact and usability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1:\nInput: Social media post expressing anxiety and ambivalence about an advertising campaign’s intention.\nOutput: The system infers anxious behavioral intent consistent with CBT frameworks, adjusts the LLM’s sentiment analysis output to prevent misclassification of negative sentiment as bias, thus preserving fair treatment of consumer attitudes.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: Caregiver’s message with nuanced expressions of frustration and confusion regarding dementia patient behavior.\nOutput: The model identifies intent reflecting caregiver stress and emotional state; bias correction module adjusts language model outputs to avoid stigmatizing or overly negative characterizations, enhancing fairness and empathy in clinical communication tools.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "In case behavioral intent prediction from enriched psychological and social frameworks is insufficiently reliable due to sparse or ambiguous data, the model will gracefully degrade to a confidence-weighted hybrid approach. This approach employs simpler categorical user segmentation based on demographic and socio-economic attributes combined with soft attention mechanisms modulated by prediction confidence scores, ensuring bias corrections remain robust albeit less personalized. Additionally, we will explore transfer learning from richly annotated mental health datasets to improve intent inference and fallback robustness, while continuously evaluating fairness trade-offs to avoid compounding errors in bias correction pipelines."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that behavioral intent can be reliably inferred and effectively used to adjust bias in LLM outputs warrants deeper grounding. Behavioral intent prediction from text is known to be noisy and dependent on strong contextual signals, which may not always be present in social texts. The proposal should provide stronger evidence or theoretical support for why integrating behavioral intent will meaningfully improve fairness beyond existing demographic or content-based bias correction methods. Clarifying how user intent is operationalized and validated will strengthen soundness and reduce risks of compounding errors in bias mitigation pipelines. This is critical before committing to the dual-module architecture design and downstream bias adjustments based on inferred intent and socio-economic attributes. Consider adding more extensive theoretical or empirical justification in the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections to address this foundational assumption explicitly and rigorously, ensuring the approach’s robustness and validity in diverse real-world scenarios with noisy user data and ambiguous intent cues. \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating and the proposed method's domain, the research idea would significantly benefit by integrating concepts from 'cognitive behavioral therapy principles' or 'mental health support' to enrich behavioral intent modeling. These domains offer well-studied, validated frameworks explaining user motivation and behavioral patterns which can enhance intent inference fidelity. Leveraging psychological theories could improve the interpretability and generalizability of intent predictions beyond social exchange and marketing theories alone. Moreover, connecting bias correction with mental health or dementia care contexts can broaden societal impact, opening applications for fairer AI in sensitive health communication scenarios. This multidisciplinary integration could differentiate the contribution, yielding a novel AI framework that not only mitigates bias but also supports intelligent decision-making tailored to nuanced human psychological states. I recommend expanding the Motivation and Proposed_Method sections to incorporate insights or datasets from these adjacent fields, thereby boosting both novelty and impact."
