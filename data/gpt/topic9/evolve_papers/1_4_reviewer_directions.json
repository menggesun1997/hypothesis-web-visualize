    "title": "Emotion-Aware Low-Resource Dialogue Generation with Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer",
    "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource language dialogue systems neglect emotion and sarcasm understanding, resulting in flat, unengaging user interactions that fail to capture nuanced conversational pragmatics.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to external gaps highlighting the absence of emotion and sarcasm detection integration in low-resource language generation, aiming for more human-centered computing approaches and improved personalization.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a dual-stream dialogue generation model where one stream encodes linguistic content and the other encodes affective state inferred via pretrained emotion and sarcasm detection models trained in high-resource languages and transferred via cross-lingual alignment. A gating mechanism fuses streams adaptively based on context, enabling emotion-aware and contextually tailored dialogue generation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Prepare or collect emotion-annotated dialogue datasets in high-resource and some low-resource languages. 2) Train emotion and sarcasm detection models on high-resource data with attention to transferability. 3) Design fusion-based dialogue generation models incorporating affective conditioning. 4) Evaluate emotional relevance, user engagement via human annotation, and automatic metrics. 5) Conduct transfer experiments in genuinely low-resource languages, documenting improvements over baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User says in Tamil \"நீங்க என்னை ஏமாத்துறீங்க போல இருக்கு!\" (Seems like you are mocking me!). Expected Output: Emotion-aware system replies with empathetic or humor-aware responses acknowledging sarcasm or frustration embedded in the utterance.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cross-lingual transfer of emotion models fails, fallback to language-agnostic affective features like prosody (in text: punctuation, emotive particles) and rule-based lexical emotion cues. Combine with unsupervised affective representation learning on target language corpora."

          "feedback_content": "The experiment plan appears conceptually reasonable but lacks detail on how to ensure robust cross-lingual alignment for emotion and sarcasm detection. Specifically, the proposal should address: (a) which alignment techniques or multilingual embeddings will be leveraged or adapted; (b) data scarcity issues and annotation quality in low-resource languages; (c) concrete evaluation protocols that measure transfer effectiveness distinct from base detection accuracy; and (d) handling of emotion/sarcasm nuances that might be culturally language-specific. Adding preliminary feasibility analyses or referencing prior successful transfer pipelines would strengthen confidence in execution feasibility. Clarification on fallback integration of language-agnostic affective cues into the fusion model is also needed for a smooth transition in failure cases, preventing potential disruption of training or generation quality. This will help demonstrate that the experiment plan is both scientific and practically executable end-to-end, critical for the cascading transfer approach proposed. The authors must provide more specificity and contingency integration details to elevate feasibility from an abstract plan to a concrete methodology ready for implementation and validation. The current plan risks being too high-level to guarantee experimental results matching the proposed ambitions without further elaboration and technical grounding, given the challenges of low-resource, affect-aware dialogue generation with sarcastic content involved, which is still a highly nontrivial task without strong labeled data in target languages or culturally aligned resources. Incorporating iterative human-in-the-loop validation or transfer diagnostic steps could also enhance feasibility and robustness.  \n\nIn summary, expand and refine the experiment plan with technical details and risk management approaches related to cross-lingual affective transfer and model fusion mechanisms to ensure practical experimentability and scientific rigor on this challenging problem space.\n\n---\n\nNote: Sections targeted: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, Proposed_Method, Fallback_Plan."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "To strengthen the impact and novelty beyond a standard cross-lingual affective dialogue generation pipeline, consider integrating advances from the linked concepts such as leveraging pre-trained transformer-based language models (e.g., multilingual BERT or XLM-R) specialized for emotion and sarcasm detection, combined with few-shot learning techniques to better adapt to low-resource languages. Augment transfer learning with cognitive neuroscience inspired affective representations, potentially improved by incorporating prosodic or syntactic cues from digital communication environments, which may capture subtle sarcasm and emotion beyond lexical signals. Moreover, integrating offensive language or fake news detection modules could enhance the dialogue system’s safety and relevance in contentious contexts, increasing real-world utility. Exploiting opinion mining frameworks in the target language’s online discourse can provide auxiliary signals to enrich contextually appropriate affective responses. This holistic integration would position the work at the intersection of affective computing, cognitive insights, transformer architectures, and responsible language technologies, elevating its novelty and broadening its societal impact. A detailed plan to incorporate few-shot adaptation and multimodal or multi-cue fusion aligned with global benchmarks in emotion recognition and sarcastic understanding could distinguish this work from strong competitive prior art and maximize contribution to the field. This cross-disciplinary, globally informed integration could also open new avenues for user engagement personalization, far beyond mere cross-lingual transfer techniques. \n\n---\n\nNote: Sections targeted: Proposed_Method, Motivation, Title."
