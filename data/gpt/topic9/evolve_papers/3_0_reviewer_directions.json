    "title": "Ontology Anchored Neural-Legal Explanation Network",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current legal AI explanations lack seamless integration of hierarchical legal ontologies within language models, limiting domain-aware interpretability essential for high-stakes decisions.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of disjoint ontology and LLM explanation processes by embedding legal ontology knowledge directly into the model's reasoning pathway, creating semantically grounded, legally compliant explanations.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel neural architecture integrating an explicit legal ontology embedding module tightly coupled with Transformer-based LLMs. Ontology nodes and relations are embedded as learnable vectors aligned with token embeddings. Attention layers incorporate ontology context to guide reasoning and explanation generation. Output explanations explicitly reference ontology elements, providing transparent semantic rationales adhering to legal interpretability norms.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Construct or adapt a large-scale hierarchical legal ontology with rich semantic relations; (2) Pretrain ontology embeddings using graph embedding techniques; (3) Integrate embeddings into a Transformer-based LLM fine-tuned on legal corpora; (4) Develop explanation extraction aligned with ontology annotations; (5) Benchmark against standard post-hoc methods using interpretability metrics adapted for legal contexts; (6) Conduct user studies with legal practitioners for trust evaluation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Interpret contractual obligations in clause 4 regarding termination.\" Expected Output: Explanation highlighting relevant ontology nodes such as 'Contractual Obligation', 'Termination Clause', and the reasoning path linking these, making the decision process transparent in legal terms.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If tight ontology integration impedes model performance, fallback to modular pipeline with ontology-guided explanation post-processing. Conduct ablation studies to isolate ontology contribution and iteratively refine integration."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed method of embedding legal ontology nodes and relations as learnable vectors aligned with token embeddings in a Transformer-based LLM is promising, the explanation lacks clarity on how the ontology context is effectively integrated within the attention mechanisms without disrupting the model's language understanding. Specifically, it is unclear how competing signals between free-text tokens and ontology embeddings are balanced, how dynamic context shifts are handled, and the exact mechanism to ensure explanations explicitly and reliably reference ontology elements. We recommend expanding the Proposed_Method section to provide a detailed architectural diagram and describe the integration points with attention computations, justification for design choices, and mechanisms to keep ontology grounding semantically tight yet flexible within the neural model's reasoning pipeline. This clarity is crucial for reproducibility and to convince reviewers of the soundness of the approach's core mechanism. Furthermore, explicit mention of how legal interpretability norms are operationalized within the model would strengthen this section substantially. This gap affects the foundational soundness and must be addressed early during revision. Target Section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is comprehensive but lacks detail on critical feasibility aspects, such as: (1) The sourcing, construction, or adaptation method for the large-scale hierarchical legal ontology—will this rely on publicly available ontologies, expert curation, or automated extraction? This impacts timeline and reproducibility significantly. (2) The plan to pretrain ontology embeddings via graph embedding techniques requires specificity on the chosen algorithm (e.g., node2vec, GCN, or others), parameter settings, and how this embedding space will be aligned or calibrated with the textual token embedding space. (3) Although integrating embeddings into LLM fine-tuning is mentioned, potential challenges like catastrophic forgetting of language knowledge or model capacity limitations are not addressed. (4) Explanation extraction aligned with ontology annotations is underspecified—how will alignment be quantitatively measured and ensured? (5) Finally, user studies with legal practitioners are ambitious and impactful but lack a recruitment strategy, evaluation metrics, or planned study design details to ensure their feasibility within typical project constraints. Addressing these feasibility gaps with concrete, technically grounded plans and risk mitigation strategies will be essential to demonstrate the project's viability.
