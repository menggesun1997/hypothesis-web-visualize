    "title": "Multimodal Inconsistency Detection for Low-Resource Dialogue Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current low-resource language dialogue systems often produce outputs with factual inconsistencies and hallucinations due to sparse training data and insufficient tailored inconsistency detection mechanisms, limiting their practical usability and user trust.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of lack of rigorous inconsistency detection tailored for low-resource languages and the high-potential innovation opportunity combining dialogue generation with inconsistency detection and noisy channel modeling. It leverages the hidden bridge between these domains into an integrated solution.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel dialogue system architecture integrating a multimodal inconsistency-aware module that incorporates natural language inference (NLI) with discourse-aware hierarchical planning and noisy channel model components. This module jointly evaluates generated dialogue turns against prior context and external structured knowledge graphs enriched for low-resource languages. Pretrained cross-lingual transformer models fine-tuned with adversarial examples of hallucinated outputs will form the backbone. The approach will also integrate morphological analysis to handle complex grammatical structures unique to languages such as Bangla and Indo-Aryan variants.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect and curate contextualized low-resource dialogue datasets augmented with knowledge graph annotations. 2) Pretrain cross-lingual transformer models on multilingual data with syntactic morphological tagging. 3) Build and integrate an inconsistency detection module combining NLI with noisy channel probabilities. 4) Evaluate dialogue fluency, factual consistency via human annotation and automatic metrics including BLEU, ROUGE, and custom factuality scores. 5) Compare against baseline dialogue generation models without inconsistency modules. 6) Conduct ablation studies on multimodality and knowledge graph integration.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User asks in Bangla \"আমি আগামীকাল আবহাওয়া কেমন হবে?\" (What will the weather be like tomorrow?). Expected Output: Dialogue system responds with factually consistent, context-aware answer referencing external knowledge (e.g., \"আগামীকাল ধূপ-বাদল থাকবে, তাপমাত্রা ৩২ ডিগ্রী সেলসিয়াস।\" - Tomorrow it will be partly cloudy with 32°C). The system flags or corrects responses that hallucinate weather or give inconsistent information.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal NLI fails to scale, fallback to purely text-based inconsistency detection enhanced with augmented data via back-translation. If noisy channel integration underperforms, revert to separate post-generation verification modules. Additionally, explore rule-based morphological consistency checks as complementary heuristics."

          "feedback_content": "While the experiment plan is thorough, it hinges critically on curating or obtaining suitable low-resource dialogue datasets with rich knowledge graph annotations, which can be challenging given the scarcity and noisiness of such data. The plan should include specific strategies for dataset creation/validation and methods to ensure the quality and representativeness of morphological tagging for highly diverse language variants. Additionally, adversarial example generation for hallucinations and the integration of noisy channel modeling are complex tasks that might require incremental validation steps to ensure stability before full integration. Providing more details or fallback validation milestones would improve feasibility assessment substantially, reducing risk of stalled progress during end-to-end system integration and evaluation phases, especially in under-resourced settings. Overall, enhancing practical dataset and robustness strategies will improve scientific soundness and execution likelihood of the plan, given the high complexity of multimodal NLI and morphological analysis in underrepresented languages. \n\nSuggestion: explicitly include dataset validation/augmentation sub-steps, staged integration with quantitative progress criteria, and fallback checkpoints for critical model components within the experiment plan to ensure feasibility and experiment tractability under resource constraints or tooling limitations.  \n\n[FEA-EXPERIMENT] applies to Proposed_Method and Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan sections."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and the presence of numerous global concepts such as constrained Markov decision processes, AI/ML models, and automatic evaluation methods, integrating reinforcement learning framed as a constrained decision-making problem could significantly enhance the method’s impact and novelty. For example, modeling the dialogue generation and inconsistency detection process as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) where policies are learned to maximize factual consistency under constraints of fluency and morphological correctness can provide a rigorous learning framework. This could synergize well with intelligent decision-making concepts to improve robustness and efficiency, especially in low-resource languages. Additionally, leveraging recent advances in large-scale multilingual language models for pretraining, combined with advanced automatic evaluation methods tailored for factuality rather than n-gram overlaps, would bolster both feasibility and impact. This integration would differentiate the work strongly from existing approaches and elevate its contribution in the competitive space.  \n\n[So this suggestion complements the existing proposal by expanding methodological rigor and linking to broader AI paradigms, addressing NOV-COMPETITIVE concerns.]\n\n[SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION] applies across Proposed_Method and Motivation sections."
