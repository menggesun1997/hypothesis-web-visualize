    "Motivation": "Fills the internal gap of insufficient handling of complex grammatical structures by integrating noisy channel probabilistic models as a bridge to enhance robustness during generation and inconsistency detection phases specifically for morphologically rich, low-resource languages.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a morphosyntactic-aware noisy channel model that explicitly models the generation and recognition probabilities of morphological and syntactic units. This model will be integrated within an end-to-end sequence-to-sequence framework, allowing joint optimization to penalize unlikely morphological constructs during decoding. The approach leverages unsupervised morphological tagging and syntactic parsing from high-resource languages for cross-lingual transfer learning.",

        "title": "Explicit Joint Morphosyntactic Noisy Channel Model for Robust Low-Resource Language Generation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource morphologically rich languages suffer from inconsistent and hallucinated outputs in generation tasks due to inadequate modeling of complex morphosyntactic structures under data scarcity, especially affecting the reliability of sequence-to-sequence frameworks.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches insufficiently integrate morphosyntactic knowledge explicitly during decoding in generation tasks, often relying on implicit or multitask objectives which limit robustness and interpretability. We propose a clearly formulated morphosyntactic-aware noisy channel framework that jointly models morphological and syntactic units’ generation and recognition probabilities within transformer-based architectures. By formally integrating unsupervised morphological tagging and cross-lingual syntactic parsing informed by part-of-speech tagging and natural language understanding concepts, this approach advances beyond prior work by explicitly combining noisy channel modeling with end-to-end neural generation, promising improved morphosyntactic consistency and reduced hallucinations in low-resource, morphologically complex languages like Urdu and Bangla.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We design a probabilistic noisy channel model where the target sentence’s morphosyntactic structure is modeled using joint morphological and syntactic units, formalized as follows: For input sequence x and output sequence y with latent morphosyntactic annotation m, we decompose p(y|x) ∝ p(x|y,m) p(y,m). The channel model p(x|y,m) captures recognition probabilities, while the source model p(y,m) encodes generation likelihood including morphosyntactic priors. Specifically, m combines unsupervised morphological tags and syntactic parses obtained via cross-lingual transfer learning from related high-resource languages, incorporating POS tagging and syntactic role information for natural language understanding. We integrate this noisy channel framework within an end-to-end transformer sequence-to-sequence model by defining composite loss terms: a standard generation loss; a morphological consistency loss enforcing agreement with predicted m (using pointer networks for morphology alignment); and a syntactic coherence loss based on constituency and dependency parses. Model architecture diagrams illustrate interaction: the transformer decoder produces hypotheses scored jointly with morphosyntactic priors during beam search, allowing joint optimization with reinforcement learning-style policy gradients on morphosyntactic consistency metrics. Algorithmic steps explicitly detail training, inference with beam reranking using noisy channel scores, and joint backpropagation schemes. This method transparently balances decoder fluency and morphosyntactic integrity, addressing hallucination in low-resource morphologically rich languages more effectively and with novel integration of morphosyntactic noisy channel modeling and explicit unsupervised tagging.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Preparation: Collect morphologically rich low-resource corpora in Urdu and Bangla with separate domains for training, validation, and testing; obtain high-resource linguistic resources (e.g., Hindi, Bengali) for transfer.\n\n2) Morphosyntactic Component Training: Train unsupervised morphological taggers leveraging cross-lingual embeddings and perform syntactic parsing via transfer learning from related languages. Utilize part-of-speech tagging and perform domain adaptation with adversarial training to mitigate domain mismatch and noise. Evaluate tagger/parser accuracy with intrinsic metrics.\n\n3) Noisy Channel Model Implementation: Formalize joint probabilities with explicit loss formulations; implement transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model with integrated morphosyntactic noisy channel modules.\n\n4) Intermediate Validation: Conduct ablation studies isolating morphology and syntax components’ effects on generation robustness. Compare with transformer-only baselines and multitask morphological tagging approaches.\n\n5) Full Model Training: Use multi-objective loss with hyperparameter tuning; monitor hallucination rate reduction using both automatic hallucination detection metrics (e.g., hallucinated tense/agreement inconsistencies) and human evaluation.\n\n6) Task Evaluation: Apply to summarization and dialogue generation in target languages, reporting morphosyntactic accuracy, fluency, hallucination reduction, BLEU/ROUGE scores, and qualitative analyses.\n\n7) Computational Feasibility: Document resource usage; explore optimization strategies including mixed-precision training and model pruning.\n\n8) Fallback Exploration: If transfer learning components underperform, pivot to heavily curated data augmentation for morphological variety or fallback to implicit multitask training as backup plan with explicit failure thresholds.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example input: Bangla sentence \"সে রাতে দোকান বন্ধ ছিল।\" (The shop was closed that night.)\n\nExpected output: Summary or dialogue generation maintaining consistent morphological tense and agreement (e.g., past tense markers, noun-verb agreement) without hallucinated forms. For instance, a generated summary with correctly inflected verbs and nouns mirroring input morphology, avoiding hallucinated tense shifts or incorrect noun forms.\n\nAdditional detailed test cases involve noisy input with morphological ambiguities verifying model robustness, and syntactically complex Urdu sentences emphasizing correct syntactic role preservation during generation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If explicit joint morphosyntactic noisy channel modeling reveals training instability or excessive computational overhead, fallback strategies include: \n\n- Multitask learning within transformer frameworks jointly optimizing morphological tagging and generation with designed auxiliary heads.\n\n- Data augmentation simulating morphological variations via morphological inflection libraries in target languages enhancing robustness.\n\n- Simplification of probabilistic model by decoupling morphology and syntax or leveraging pretrained syntactic transformers for auxiliary guidance.\n\n- Threshold-based early stopping and performance monitoring on morphosyntactic consistency metrics to revert to baseline transformer generation if novel components degrade performance.\n\nThese fallback plans incorporate quantitative performance thresholds defined during intermediate validations to enable rapid iteration and ensure practicality."

Specifically, details on the interaction between noisy channel components and transformer-based decoders, and how unsupervised morphological tagging integrates into training, should be explicitly clarified with formalized probabilistic formulation and concrete algorithmic steps. Clarifying these aspects can strengthen the soundness of the method and better convince reviewers of its feasibility and novelty potential within morphologically complex, low-resource settings, avoiding ambiguity about the integration pipeline and optimization procedure. Consider including model architecture diagrams and exact loss formulations for added transparency and reproducibility in the next iteration of the proposal, as this will directly impact confidence in the core mechanism's validity and effectiveness in addressing the stated problem statement while maintaining decoder fluency and consistency without hallucination artifacts during generation tasks such as summarization or dialogue generation under data scarcity conditions specific to languages like Urdu and Bangla.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed experimental plan broadly covers logical steps, it underestimates the complexity of training reliable morphological analyzers and syntactic parsers through cross-lingual transfer learning for highly diverse morphosyntactic systems in low-resource languages such as Urdu and Bangla. Additional details on source languages selection, adaptation strategies, evaluation metrics for transferred parsers, and mitigation of noisy or domain-mismatched training data are necessary for assessing feasibility concretely. Moreover, integrating the morphosyntactic noisy channel with transformer-based generation models will require substantial engineering; the proposal should clarify planned approaches for joint optimization and computational resource requirements.\n\nTo improve, the plan should include intermediate validation stages focused on morphological tagger and parser quality, baseline comparisons, and ablation studies isolating effects of noisy channel integration. This ensures stepwise validation of components and identifies bottlenecks early. Also, defining explicit quantitative and qualitative metrics for hallucination detection and morphosyntactic consistency will guide rigorous evaluation. Including fallback plans targeting potential failure modes for transfer learning and noisy channel implementation with relevant performance thresholds can improve robustness and increase confidence in feasibility before full-scale end-to-end experiments. Without such details, the experimental plan risks being overly optimistic regarding timelines and success probability on real-world morphologically complex low-resource datasets."
