    "title": "Zero-shot Legal Explanation via Domain-Adapted Prompt Engineering",
    "Problem_Statement": "Legal explainability pipelines underexploit zero-shot and prompt-based learning, causing limited adaptability to diverse legal domains and stakeholder perspectives without extensive retraining.",
    "Motivation": "Fills external gap by employing advanced zero-shot prompting strategies from NLP to generate tailored, context-sensitive legal explanations without domain-specific fine-tuning, expanding scalability and customizability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a prompt engineering framework leveraging foundation LLMs with legal domain lexicons and ontologies embedded in prompt templates. Employ dynamic prompt refinement utilizing user feedback to generate multi-perspective explanations tailored to different legal roles. Integrate ontology-informed trigger tokens to enhance semantic grounding.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Create prompt templates embedding legal ontological concepts; (2) Evaluate zero-shot explanation quality on varied legal document datasets; (3) Incorporate multi-stakeholder feedback to iteratively refine prompts; (4) Benchmark against supervised fine-tuned models on explanation accuracy and user trust metrics; (5) Analyze domain generalization capability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Explain implications of privacy clause for client.\" Expected Output: Role-specific explanation addressing client concerns with legally grounded language generated zero-shot via prompting.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If zero-shot explanations lack precision, incorporate few-shot in-context examples or pursue lightweight domain-adaptive fine-tuning."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks specific metrics and baseline details necessary to scientifically validate zero-shot prompting efficacy and multi-stakeholder explanation quality. For example, legal explanation quality should be quantitatively measured using established explainability metrics or human expert annotations, and user trust should be assessed through well-defined survey instruments or interaction logs. The plan should specify dataset diversity, size, and legal domains addressed to ensure feasibility in evaluating domain generalization. Additionally, the iterative prompt refinement process needs clarity on how user feedback will be collected, modeled, and integrated systematically rather than ad hoc. Explicit experimental protocols and success criteria will enhance reproducibility and robustness of conclusions, which currently are underspecified in the proposal's feasibility aspect. Thus, refining the experiment plan with detailed methodology and evaluation standards is critical for practical execution and meaningful validation of claims in zero-shot legal explanation generation tailored by role-specific prompts and ontology integration. This will help ascertain if the approach truly generalizes and improves upon fine-tuned models, as stated in the proposal's motivation and benchmarking objectives, rather than rely on qualitative assertions or high-level descriptions alone. This focused revision will also guide resource allocation effectively and mitigate risks of inconclusive results or implementation dead-ends due to vague experimental design assumptions embedded in the current plan phase descriptions for the core research idea workflow involving prompt engineering and legal ontology embedding within foundation LLM contexts. Please provide a more concrete, structured, and scientifically rigorous experimental plan to support feasibility assessment and downstream impact evaluation reliably and reproducibly for this ambitious zero-shot prompting scheme for legal explainability pipelines tailored by multi-perspective prompt engineering and ontology triggers integrated with user feedback loops per your method design outline at the heart of the proposed research idea's contribution attempt and tested capabilities scope evaluation framework criteria and workflow architecture design assumptions, aligned with state-of-art explainability and domain-adaptation evaluation methodologies in NLP and legal AI domains especially when considering multi-role explanation generation and diverse legal document sources or configurations to benchmark properly against strong supervised fine-tuning baselines and user trust metrics clusters in the legal NLP research space today, to strengthen confidence and accuracy of results, interpretability, and applicability beyond initial datasets or narrowly defined scenarios. This detailed experimental rigor inclusion will increase feasibility confidence and facilitate a clearly measurable impact demonstration for this research idea submission under review at a premier conference venue in AI and NLP law-related research innovation spaces, thereby reducing ambiguity and enhancing methodological soundness overall in this critical review dimension for zero-shot legal explanation tasks via domain-adapted prompt engineering as proposed here. Thank you for addressing this insight promptly with substantial experimental design detail updates aiming to elevate the research quality and execution viability beyond current descriptive outline states prone to feasibility challenges if left unexpanded and under-specified currently in the proposal, especially given competitive novelty context already noted for the idea under review in a high-expectation conference setting scenario with strong precedent research in connected core Ai and NLP components fields as documented in similar advanced AI application domains currently published and tested worldwide in legal NLP explanation multi-domain adaptation challenges contexts today with large foundation LLM frameworks and legal ontologies prompt-based adaptation approaches combined with real-time feedback refinement loops for user-centric explanation tailoring and grounding precision assurance needs across domain experts, lawyers, clients, and regulators, ensuring the research outcome is robust, validated, and deployable toward practical real-world legal usage contexts comprehensively and reliably at scale as planned by the research idea authors appropriately aligned with state-of-art standard practices and peer expectations at this senior review stage for a top-tier venue."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE, to enhance the research idea's impact and distinguish it from strong existing work in zero-shot prompting and legal NLP, consider integrating knowledge graphs or domain-specific knowledge graphs (a globally linked concept) beyond traditional legal ontologies. Embedding a legal knowledge graph within the prompting framework could enhance semantic interoperability and ensure more accurate, context-aware explanations by dynamically linking concepts and case laws during explanation generation. Such integration can enable the model to reason over structured legal knowledge and provide richer, evidence-backed explanations catering to multi-stakeholder perspectives. Moreover, this could extend the approach towards intelligent decision-making support in legal contexts, creating a pathway to downstream applications like compliance checking or intelligent legal assistant systems. This global integration could therefore simultaneously address novelty and impact gaps and differentiate the method from standard prompt engineering approaches while aligning with current trends in combining foundation LLMs with knowledge graphs for enhanced domain expertise and explanation fidelity in complex real-world scenarios such as legal explanation generation."
