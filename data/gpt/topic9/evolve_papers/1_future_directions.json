        "title": "Multimodal Inconsistency Detection for Low-Resource Dialogue Systems",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current low-resource language dialogue systems often produce outputs with factual inconsistencies and hallucinations due to sparse training data and insufficient tailored inconsistency detection mechanisms, limiting their practical usability and user trust.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of lack of rigorous inconsistency detection tailored for low-resource languages and the high-potential innovation opportunity combining dialogue generation with inconsistency detection and noisy channel modeling. It leverages the hidden bridge between these domains into an integrated solution.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel dialogue system architecture integrating a multimodal inconsistency-aware module that incorporates natural language inference (NLI) with discourse-aware hierarchical planning and noisy channel model components. This module jointly evaluates generated dialogue turns against prior context and external structured knowledge graphs enriched for low-resource languages. Pretrained cross-lingual transformer models fine-tuned with adversarial examples of hallucinated outputs will form the backbone. The approach will also integrate morphological analysis to handle complex grammatical structures unique to languages such as Bangla and Indo-Aryan variants.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect and curate contextualized low-resource dialogue datasets augmented with knowledge graph annotations. 2) Pretrain cross-lingual transformer models on multilingual data with syntactic morphological tagging. 3) Build and integrate an inconsistency detection module combining NLI with noisy channel probabilities. 4) Evaluate dialogue fluency, factual consistency via human annotation and automatic metrics including BLEU, ROUGE, and custom factuality scores. 5) Compare against baseline dialogue generation models without inconsistency modules. 6) Conduct ablation studies on multimodality and knowledge graph integration.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User asks in Bangla \"আমি আগামীকাল আবহাওয়া কেমন হবে?\" (What will the weather be like tomorrow?). Expected Output: Dialogue system responds with factually consistent, context-aware answer referencing external knowledge (e.g., \"আগামীকাল ধূপ-বাদল থাকবে, তাপমাত্রা ৩২ ডিগ্রী সেলসিয়াস।\" - Tomorrow it will be partly cloudy with 32°C). The system flags or corrects responses that hallucinate weather or give inconsistent information.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal NLI fails to scale, fallback to purely text-based inconsistency detection enhanced with augmented data via back-translation. If noisy channel integration underperforms, revert to separate post-generation verification modules. Additionally, explore rule-based morphological consistency checks as complementary heuristics."

        "title": "Cross-Lingual Human-Aligned Evaluation Metrics for Low-Resource Summarization",
        "Problem_Statement": "Evaluation metrics for abstractive summarization in low-resource languages do not adequately reflect human judgment, especially given linguistic diversity and scarcity of evaluation data, impeding reliable progress.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the external gap of imperfect alignment between automatic evaluation metrics and human judgment in low-resource contexts, and leverages the opportunity to combine noisy channel-based error modeling with human signals for robust evaluation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create a cross-lingual evaluation framework by training auxiliary noisy channel models that model typical summarization errors in low-resource languages based on transfer learning from similar high-resource languages. Integrate this with human-annotated evaluation signals collected via crowd-sourcing campaigns in target languages. Employ a meta-evaluation approach training a learned metric combining lexical, semantic embedding, and noisy channel estimated error probabilities to better align with humans.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Aggregate parallel summarization datasets across multiple languages, including low-resource ones, with human evaluation annotations. 2) Train noisy channel models to identify typical errors. 3) Develop and train a learned evaluation metric incorporating noisy channel error predictions, embedding similarities (e.g., multilingual BERT), and traditional metrics. 4) Validate correlation improvements against human judgment compared to BLEU/ROUGE. 5) Test generalization on novel low-resource languages and domains.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Generated summary in Marathi for a Hindi news article. Existing metric scores 0.65 BLEU, human scores 0.80 for correctness. Proposed metric adjusts to 0.79 correlating closer with human judgment, correctly penalizing hallucinations and missed key points.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If noisy channel modeling introduces noise, shift to ensemble learning combining semantic similarity metrics and crowd-sourced feedback signals alone. Investigate unsupervised metric learning with synthetic error injection as alternative."

        "title": "Knowledge-Graph-Augmented Multilingual Low-Resource Language Models with Sociocultural Context",
        "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource language generation models often neglect sociocultural and pragmatic context, limiting relevance and user engagement, especially for languages with complex, underrepresented grammar and cultural nuances.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses external gaps mentioning the missed opportunity to incorporate emotion/sarcasm detection, human-centered computing, and external knowledge integration into low-resource language generation, pushing the frontier beyond linguistic correctness to effective pragmatic communication.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Engineer a multilingual language model architecture integrating external domain- and culture-specific knowledge graphs with affective computing modules (emotion and sarcasm detectors) as conditioning signals. The model will employ a hierarchical latent variable framework to fuse sociocultural context with linguistic generation, allowing context-aware personalized outputs. Specialized grammatic feature embeddings capture complex structures in languages like Bangla and Indo-Aryan family.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct or extend existing knowledge graphs with culturally relevant nodes and relations for target languages. 2) Collect datasets annotated for emotion, sarcasm, and cultural context. 3) Pretrain and fine-tune multilingual large language model architectures enhanced with cultural and affective embeddings. 4) Evaluate on generation tasks measuring factuality, cultural appropriateness, emotional alignment, and human preference studies. 5) Compare with baseline generation ignoring these features.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt in Sinhala requesting an empathetic response to a user’s story of loss. Expected Output: Generated text reflecting culturally sensitive condolence, appropriate emotional tone, and idiomatic expressions consistent with Sinhala culture and language grammar.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If knowledge graph integration challenges arise, fallback to latent variable models conditioning only on affective and morphological embeddings. Use adversarial or reinforcement learning to iteratively improve pragmatic correctness based on user feedback."

        "title": "Noisy Channel Guided Morphosyntactic Robustness for Low-Resource Languages",
        "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource language models struggle with complex morphosyntactic phenomena, leading to instability and hallucinated content in generation tasks under data scarcity.",
        "Motivation": "Fills the internal gap of insufficient handling of complex grammatical structures by integrating noisy channel probabilistic models as a bridge to enhance robustness during generation and inconsistency detection phases specifically for morphologically rich, low-resource languages.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a morphosyntactic-aware noisy channel model that explicitly models the generation and recognition probabilities of morphological and syntactic units. This model will be integrated within an end-to-end sequence-to-sequence framework, allowing joint optimization to penalize unlikely morphological constructs during decoding. The approach leverages unsupervised morphological tagging and syntactic parsing from high-resource languages for cross-lingual transfer learning.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect corpora for target low-resource morphologically complex languages (e.g., Urdu, Bangla). 2) Train morphological analyzers and parsers using transfer learning from related languages. 3) Implement a noisy channel model framework incorporating morphosyntactic probabilities. 4) Integrate with transformer-based generation models for tasks like summarization and dialogue. 5) Evaluate morphosyntactic accuracy, hallucination rate reduction, and overall fluency against existing baselines.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Bangla sentence \"সে রাতে দোকান বন্ধ ছিলা।\" (The shop was closed that night.). Expected Output: System correctly generates consistent morphosyntactic forms in summaries or dialogue without hallucinated tense or agreement errors.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If explicit morphosyntactic modeling proves inefficient, fallback to implicit modeling via multitask learning with auxiliary morphological tagging objectives within transformer architectures, or data augmentation techniques simulating morphological variations."

        "title": "Emotion-Aware Low-Resource Dialogue Generation with Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer",
        "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource language dialogue systems neglect emotion and sarcasm understanding, resulting in flat, unengaging user interactions that fail to capture nuanced conversational pragmatics.",
        "Motivation": "Responds to external gaps highlighting the absence of emotion and sarcasm detection integration in low-resource language generation, aiming for more human-centered computing approaches and improved personalization.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Build a dual-stream dialogue generation model where one stream encodes linguistic content and the other encodes affective state inferred via pretrained emotion and sarcasm detection models trained in high-resource languages and transferred via cross-lingual alignment. A gating mechanism fuses streams adaptively based on context, enabling emotion-aware and contextually tailored dialogue generation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Prepare or collect emotion-annotated dialogue datasets in high-resource and some low-resource languages. 2) Train emotion and sarcasm detection models on high-resource data with attention to transferability. 3) Design fusion-based dialogue generation models incorporating affective conditioning. 4) Evaluate emotional relevance, user engagement via human annotation, and automatic metrics. 5) Conduct transfer experiments in genuinely low-resource languages, documenting improvements over baselines.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User says in Tamil \"நீங்க என்னை ஏமாத்துறீங்க போல இருக்கு!\" (Seems like you are mocking me!). Expected Output: Emotion-aware system replies with empathetic or humor-aware responses acknowledging sarcasm or frustration embedded in the utterance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If cross-lingual transfer of emotion models fails, fallback to language-agnostic affective features like prosody (in text: punctuation, emotive particles) and rule-based lexical emotion cues. Combine with unsupervised affective representation learning on target language corpora."
