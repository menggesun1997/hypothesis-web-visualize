    "title": "Neural Architecture Search Framework Integrating Multi-Path CNN Designs for Edge NLP LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Conventional neural architecture search (NAS) techniques have yet to target the unique multi-path and channel-wise efficient designs proven in CNNs for vision, limiting discovery of lightweight, fast, and accurate NLP models optimized for edge IoT deployment.",
    "Motivation": "This idea tackles the identified gap of adapting CNN multi-path and channel-aware architectures into automated NAS for resource-constrained NLP LLMs, bridging the divide between CNN successes and transformer-based NLP model efficiency at the edge.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a NAS framework that parametrizes multi-path convolution-inspired modules alongside traditional transformer blocks in a shared search space. Incorporate channel boosting and dynamic path selection into the search criteria with constraints on FLOPS, latency, and memory. Use multi-objective evolutionary algorithms balancing accuracy, efficiency, and inference speed. Extend search to include quantization and pruning configurations, optimizing both architecture and compression jointly. The search is guided by resource profiling on representative IoT edge hardware simulators.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Define a search space combining convolutional multi-paths and transformer primitives. 2) Configure multi-objective NAS using evolutionary or reinforcement learning algorithms. 3) Use IoT NLP benchmarks for training and validation during search. 4) Evaluate discovered architectures against baseline LLMs and CNN-efficiency inspired models. 5) Deploy best models on real edge hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson, Raspberry Pi) and measure latency, energy, and accuracy trade-offs. 6) Analyze search efficiency and model interpretability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Email subject lines needing categorization into spam/non-spam on an IoT gateway device with limited RAM. Expected output: NAS-designed model accurately classifies in real-time (<100ms inference) with model size under 2MB.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If NAS search space is too large or computationally expensive, reduce complexity by fixing some architectural components or leverage surrogate modeling to accelerate search. Alternatively, manually design multi-path hybrid modules inspired by NAS insights and optimize via conventional training methods."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that CNN multi-path and channel-wise efficient designs can be directly adapted and beneficially integrated into NAS frameworks targeting NLP large language models (LLMs) for edge devices needs stronger justification. CNNs and transformers differ fundamentally in modeling sequential and hierarchical information, and the proposal does not sufficiently motivate why CNN-inspired modules will improve NLP LLM efficiency and accuracy on edge hardware. It would strengthen the work to provide preliminary evidence or theoretical arguments that multi-path CNN designs translate well to transformer-based NLP architectures, or at least clarify limitations of prior NAS methods in this context to validate this assumption fully. Without such justification, the foundation of the proposed method risks being weak or overoptimistic, affecting soundness and impact evaluation."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan is comprehensive but may face feasibility challenges regarding computational expense and search complexity. Incorporating multi-path convolution modules, transformer blocks, channel boosting, dynamic path selection, quantization, and pruning jointly in a NAS search space is likely to be extremely large and computationally demanding. Although a fallback plan briefly mentions fixing architectural components or surrogate modeling, the plan lacks concrete details or preliminary feasibility analysis on controlling search space size or convergence speed. A more detailed experimental feasibility roadmap — including benchmarks on search cost, resource consumption, and potential runtime of evolutionary NAS algorithms with these constraints — would provide a clearer assessment of practical viability and help avoid wasted computation or inconclusive results."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "To elevate novelty and impact beyond a competitive baseline, consider integrating ‘knowledge graph’ or ‘multimodal learning’ concepts into the NAS optimization objectives or search space. For example, enabling discovered architectures to natively process and fuse structured knowledge graph embeddings with text inputs or extend to multimodal signals (like speech or vision) could open new frontiers for efficient edge NLP applications. Incorporating ‘efficient resource management’ strategies dynamically based on the target edge device profile or runtime conditions could further boost relevance. Leveraging these linked concepts can make the framework more distinctive and impactful, positioning it well for premier venues and practical edge deployments."
