    "title": "DynamicPrivacyFairRLFramework",
    "Problem_Statement": "Static bias mitigation frameworks cannot cope with rapid changes in social media content and user demographics while maintaining privacy constraints.",
    "Motivation": "Fills internal gap by innovating a dynamic reinforcement learning framework with built-in privacy mechanisms to adapt fairness strategies in real-time, a novel step beyond static models.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement an RL agent that continuously learns from anonymized input streams with privacy guarantees, adapting bias mitigation policies to temporal, regional, and demographic shifts, coupled with transparent explainability and audit trails.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather temporally tagged and geographically tagged social media datasets. 2) Build privacy-preserving data pipelines. 3) Train RL agent with fairness-aware reward signals. 4) Monitor fairness and privacy metrics over training epochs and real-time deployment.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: New trend in social media posts with emergent slang possibly biased against certain groups. Output: RL agent detects and corrects emerging bias patterns rapidly under privacy constraints.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "Fallback to batch offline fairness optimization if online RL is unstable; incorporate meta-learning techniques to accelerate adaptation."
