    "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Legal Explanation Assessment Toolkit",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a scarcity of scalable, user-centric evaluation metrics and tools tailored for diverse legal stakeholder groups to assess explanation quality effectively.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gap by designing an interactive, multi-perspective evaluation platform that integrates minimal supervision and human feedback to measure explanation trustworthiness and interpretability contextualized to legal users.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a web-based toolkit enabling judges, lawyers, and clients to iteratively evaluate AI explanations via customizable metrics derived from legal interpretability frameworks. Incorporate active learning to refine evaluation functions from sparse annotated feedback, provide visualization dashboards for explanation comprehension, and enable crowd-sourced validation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Collaborate with legal experts to define evaluation criteria; (2) Implement interactive user interface for explanation assessment; (3) Deploy active learning algorithms to adapt evaluation over time; (4) Validate tool effectiveness through user studies; (5) Compare automated scoring with expert judgments for reliability analysis.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI-generated explanation for a legal ruling. Output: Multi-faceted evaluation scores reflecting legal soundness, clarity, and user trust voted by diverse stakeholders.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If user engagement is low, design gamified feedback collection or simulate expert annotations to bootstrap evaluation models."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that diverse legal stakeholder groups (judges, lawyers, clients) can effectively converge on shared, customizable metrics of explanation quality and trustworthiness within a single platform. However, legal stakeholders often have highly divergent priorities, expertise, and interpretability needs, which might challenge the assumption that a unified toolkit with minimal supervision and sparse feedback can reliably capture these nuances. The proposal should elaborate on how these heterogeneous perspectives will be reconciled or addressed to ensure meaningful, valid evaluation outputs across groups, possibly by incorporating tailored interfaces or explanation modalities per stakeholder type rather than a one-size-fits-all approach to metric definition and evaluation mechanism design. Clarifying and validating this assumption through preliminary formative user research will strengthen soundness and reduce risk of overly generalized or unusable evaluation metrics for key user cohorts in legal contexts, where interpretability stakes are high and vary substantially across roles and expertise levels. This is critical to build trust and adoption in such a sensitive domain, especially given the scarcity of scalable tools cited as motivation. Without this, the foundation for the methodology risks being fragile or overly optimistic on cross-group convergence in interpretability assessment criteria and human feedback integration methods, which underpin the active learning system's success as proposed. Please expand or justify how the heterogeneous needs and interpretability paradigms of legal stakeholders will be accommodated and balanced within the toolkit’s metric customization and human-in-the-loop design to ensure the core assumptions are robust and realistic for real-world deployment contexts in legal AI explanation evaluation. This is key for soundness of the proposed method’s design and eventual practical utility in complex stakeholder ecosystems like the legal domain. More depth and specificity are needed in this area to fortify the conceptual soundness of the idea’s foundational assumptions and interactive evaluation paradigm for explanation quality assessment tailored to legal users.  \n\n---\n\n**Suggested target section:** Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines sensible stages but lacks detail on critical feasibility aspects that could undermine successful realization, especially regarding deployment with diverse legal stakeholder groups. For instance, Stage (1) mentions collaborating with legal experts to define evaluation criteria, but does not clarify how many experts will be engaged, their diversity (e.g., judges, lawyers, clients), or how conflicting criteria and priorities will be resolved. Without a structured plan for stakeholder recruitment, selection, and consensus-building methods, this foundational step risks being incomplete or biased.\n\nStage (3) proposes deploying active learning algorithms to adapt evaluation over time from sparse feedback, but the plan lacks methodological specifics, such as the type of active learning model, criteria for selecting queries, or how the sparse labeled data problem will practically be overcome in the context of legal explanation assessment. More importantly, it must consider legal stakeholders’ limited availability and willingness to participate in iterative feedback cycles.\n\nThe plan also omits risk mitigation strategies for potential low user engagement beyond the fallback gamification strategy, which may not suit professional legal users. Details on how user studies will be designed to scientifically and ethically evaluate the tool’s effectiveness, including sample sizes, experimental controls, and metrics for success, are missing. Additionally, there is no mention of system scalability or technical infrastructure to support iterative improvement and real-time visualization dashboards in a demanding legal environment.\n\nIn summary, the experiment plan needs to be substantially enriched with detailed protocols for expert collaboration, algorithmic approach specifics, user engagement strategies tailored to legal professionals, evaluation methodology rigor, and infrastructural/logistical considerations. Doing so will increase feasibility confidence and reduce risk of stall or failure during implementation and evaluation. \n\n**Suggested target section:** Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
