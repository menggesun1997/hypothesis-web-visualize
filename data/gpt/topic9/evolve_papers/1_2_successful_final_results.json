    "title": "Knowledge-Graph-Augmented Multilingual Low-Resource Language Models with Sociocultural Context",
    "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource language generation models often neglect sociocultural and pragmatic context, limiting relevance and user engagement, especially for languages with complex, underrepresented grammar and cultural nuances.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses external gaps mentioning the missed opportunity to incorporate emotion/sarcasm detection, human-centered computing, and external knowledge integration into low-resource language generation, pushing the frontier beyond linguistic correctness to effective pragmatic communication.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Engineer a multilingual language model architecture integrating external domain- and culture-specific knowledge graphs with affective computing modules (emotion and sarcasm detectors) as conditioning signals. The model will employ a hierarchical latent variable framework to fuse sociocultural context with linguistic generation, allowing context-aware personalized outputs. Specialized grammatic feature embeddings capture complex structures in languages like Bangla and Indo-Aryan family.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct or extend existing knowledge graphs with culturally relevant nodes and relations for target languages. 2) Collect datasets annotated for emotion, sarcasm, and cultural context. 3) Pretrain and fine-tune multilingual large language model architectures enhanced with cultural and affective embeddings. 4) Evaluate on generation tasks measuring factuality, cultural appropriateness, emotional alignment, and human preference studies. 5) Compare with baseline generation ignoring these features.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt in Sinhala requesting an empathetic response to a userâ€™s story of loss. Expected Output: Generated text reflecting culturally sensitive condolence, appropriate emotional tone, and idiomatic expressions consistent with Sinhala culture and language grammar.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If knowledge graph integration challenges arise, fallback to latent variable models conditioning only on affective and morphological embeddings. Use adversarial or reinforcement learning to iteratively improve pragmatic correctness based on user feedback."

        "title": "Knowledge-Graph-Augmented Multilingual Low-Resource Language Models with Sociocultural Context and Interpersonal Pragmatics",
        "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource language generation models often overlook critical sociocultural, interpersonal, and pragmatic contexts, limiting the relevance, emotional resonance, and engagement of generated text, especially for languages with complex, underrepresented grammar and culturally nuanced communicative styles. Existing approaches insufficiently integrate social-psychological dimensions and figurative language processing crucial for authentic, culturally competent generation in these contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Beyond mere linguistic correctness, low-resource language models must address sociocultural pragmatics informed by social psychology, interpersonal communication, and applied linguistics research to enable nuanced, contextually appropriate generation. Incorporating knowledge graphs alone is insufficient; integrating dynamic, theory-driven social/pragmatic variables and figurative language understanding will fill key gaps in current research. This approach leverages interdisciplinary insights from the Routledge Handbook on Language Learning and Second Language Acquisition to ensure fine-grained adaptation to learner individual differences, cultural norms, and figurative expressions, elevating model impact and novelty in a competitive field.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a multilingual language model architecture that integrates: (1) extended external domain- and culture-specific knowledge graphs capturing sociocultural facts and norms; (2) theory-informed embeddings of social dimensions from social psychology and interpersonal communication (e.g., power distance, politeness strategies, learner individual differences); (3) figurative language processing modules informed by applied linguistics research to handle sarcasm, idioms, and style transfer effectively; and (4) affective computing modules detecting emotion and sarcasm as conditioning signals. A hierarchical latent variable framework will fuse these heterogeneous contexts with linguistic generation. Linguistically specialized embeddings will capture complex grammatical features of Bangla, Sinhala, and other Indo-Aryan languages. Collaboration with social scientists and linguists will ensure principled modeling. This interdisciplinary integration and explicit modeling of interpersonal pragmatics and figurative language distinguish the approach from existing methods.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct/extend culturally relevant knowledge graphs by combining crowdsourcing with weak supervision and transfer learning from higher-resource related languages to mitigate low-resource data scarcity. Develop detailed annotation protocols, leveraging expert linguists and social scientists, to label emotion, sarcasm, and sociocultural pragmatics, augmented by proxy signals (e.g., emoticons, reaction patterns) to improve scalability. 2) Collect multilingual corpora annotated for social-psychological dimensions and figurative language features relevant to target languages, ensuring annotator cultural competence. 3) Pretrain and fine-tune model variants incorporating (a) knowledge graphs, (b) social dimension embeddings, (c) figurative language modules, and (d) affective computing signals, evaluating individual and combined contributions. 4) Evaluate on generation tasks measuring outputs for factuality, cultural appropriateness, emotional alignment, pragmatic correctness, figurative language handling, and human preference studies involving native speakers and social scientists. 5) Develop task-specific benchmarks inspired by interpersonal communication and second-language instruction studies. 6) Define explicit criteria for fallback: if integration of knowledge graphs yields insufficient pragmatic improvement after iterative training and human evaluation, switch to models conditioning primarily on social-affective embeddings with adversarial/reinforcement learning guided by continuous user feedback loops to optimize pragmatic correctness. Iterative updates will leverage quantitative metrics and qualitative human assessments, documented in reproducible protocols.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt in Sinhala requesting an empathetic, culturally sensitive response to a user's story of loss that includes subtle irony. Expected Output: Generated text exhibits not only appropriate emotional tone and idiomatic expressions consistent with Sinhala culture and grammatical nuances but also correctly interprets and processes figurative language to respond with culturally competent empathy, demonstrating understanding of interpersonal politeness and social norms.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Explicit fallback criteria involve quantitative plateauing of pragmatic correctness metrics and negative user feedback trends documented during iterative training. Upon triggering fallback, models will rely on refined latent variable architectures conditioning on social and affective embeddings without explicit knowledge graph input. Use a reinforcement learning framework integrating real-time user feedback and adversarial evaluation to iteratively improve pragmatic and interpersonal communicative appropriateness. Continuous engagement with native speakers and social scientists will direct refinement cycles, ensuring pragmatic gains even where knowledge graph construction is infeasible due to data limitations."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while comprehensive, appears ambitious and may underestimate the significant challenges in constructing or extending culturally relevant knowledge graphs for very low-resource languages. The plan should include more concrete strategies to address data scarcity, such as leveraging weak supervision, crowdsourcing, or transfer learning from related domains/languages. Additionally, the annotation of datasets for subtle sociocultural and pragmatic features like sarcasm and emotion in diverse low-resource languages is nontrivial; more details on annotation protocols, annotator expertise, or use of proxy signals are needed to increase feasibility. Lastly, the fallback plan would benefit from more explicit criteria for switching strategies and detailed methods to measure and ensure pragmatic correctness through user feedback incorporating iterative model updates. Strengthening these aspects will make the experimental approach much more scientifically sound and executable in practice, given the inherent complexities of the task and target languages involved. This is critical before committing extensive resources to model development and evaluation phases in low-resource multilingual settings, especially those with complex grammar and cultural nuances as proposed in the problem statement and motivation sections. Â Please clarify and elaborate on these practical steps and risk mitigation measures in the Experiment_Plan section to increase confidence in feasibility and success potential of the work overall, especially since novelty is competitive in this research area and strong empirical validation will determine impact and acceptance potential at premier venues.Â Â (This critique targets Experiment_Plan and its technical specifics.)"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment, to enhance the idea's impact and distinctiveness, I suggest integrating insights from the 'social dimensions of language', 'interpersonal communication', and 'figurative language processing' concepts into the model architecture and evaluation. For instance, the model could incorporate social psychology theory-driven features or contextual variables reflecting learner individual differences and second-language instruction factors, thereby enabling fine-grained adaptation of sociocultural pragmatics beyond static knowledge graphs. Additionally, leveraging applied linguistics research on pragmatic functions in cross-cultural communication could guide specialized embeddings or context encodings to better handle figurative language and style transfer in low-resource settings. Incorporating such cross-disciplinary aspects may elevate the research beyond current computational linguistics and affective computing approaches, sharpening its contribution and potential for high impact. This integration can be concretely achieved by collaborating with linguists or social scientists and including task-specific benchmarks inspired by interpersonal communication studies. This suggestion aims to broaden both the model's practical relevance and theoretical novelty, thereby improving the proposal's competitiveness in top-tier venues and appealing to a wider interdisciplinary audience.
