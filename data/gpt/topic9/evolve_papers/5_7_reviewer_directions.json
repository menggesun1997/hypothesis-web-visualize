    "title": "CrossDisciplinaryFairnessExplainer",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current bias mitigation lacks explainability that bridges AI decisions with psychological, clinical, and socio-economic factors for transparent fairness.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap on explainability and interdisciplinary integration by designing an explainer module linking LLM decisions to human-centric interdisciplinary features.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a post-hoc explainer trained jointly on psychological and socio-economic datasets that attributes model decisions to interpretable aspects like distress indicators or behavioral intentions, enabling human-understandable fairness audits.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets tagging textual features with interdisciplinary factors. 2) Train explainer model on LLM outputs and these features. 3) Validate explanations with domain experts. 4) Use in user studies measuring trust and fairness perceptions.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Toxicity prediction for a politically sensitive post. Output: Explanation highlighting how psychological distress cues and socio-economic context influenced model fairness adjustments.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If joint training is ineffective, fallback to surrogate models or rule-based explanation systems grounded in interdisciplinary knowledge."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method outlines a high-level concept of a post-hoc explainer trained jointly on psychological and socio-economic datasets but lacks a detailed explanation of how this joint training will be operationalized and integrated with LLM outputs. Clarify the architecture and learning objectives, specify the nature of inputs and outputs, and explain how interdisciplinary features will be effectively connected to model decisions to produce valid, interpretable explanations. This mechanistic clarity is critical for convincing reviewers of the soundness of the approach and for successful implementation and evaluation phases. For example, will the explainer model be a separate module, a neural network, or a probabilistic model? How will the training pipeline ensure alignment between the various data modalities and the LLM's decisions? Addressing these points will strengthen the methodological robustness and reproducibility of the proposal. Refer to the Proposed_Method section for elaboration and refinement of the mechanism details."

Specify which publicly available or newly constructed datasets will be used for psychological, clinical, and socio-economic feature tagging, their size, quality, and representativeness. Elaborate on the criteria and process for recruiting domain experts for validating explanations, including their expertise and evaluation protocols. Detail experimental controls, metrics to quantify explanation quality, trust, and fairness perceptions in user studies, and potential challenges in annotation or expert validation. Addressing these points will help ascertain that the experiment plan is realistic, scientifically rigorous, and can yield meaningful, reproducible results within typical project constraints. Please expand in the Experiment_Plan section accordingly."
