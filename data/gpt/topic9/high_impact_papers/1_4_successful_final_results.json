    "Problem_Statement": "Data scarcity in low-resource languages impedes effective training of large language models, and existing augmentation methods often lack contextual relevance and user adaptability.",
    "Motivation": "Utilizing social robotics principles, this project introduces an adaptive, user-guided data augmentation strategy through conversational agents that generate contextually relevant synthetic data, bridging the gap between generative models and AI implementation in NLP.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a social robot simulation interface where native or proxy speakers interactively generate paraphrases, corrections, and scenario variations. These interactions produce context-rich synthetic data augmenting low-resource language corpora. The approach dynamically adapts augmentation strategies based on user feedback and model performance improvements.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop simulation platform incorporating user dialog with generative LLM backends. 2. Collect augmented dataset via interactive sessions. 3. Fine-tune base LLMs with augmented data for NLP tasks. 4. Benchmark improvements against static augmentation and no augmentation baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Sample Input: Simple sentence in a low-resource language. Output: Multiple user-guided paraphrases and contextual elaborations forming a richer training dataset, ultimately improving downstream task accuracy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If user interactions do not produce quality augmentations, fallback to semi-automated augmentation frameworks with post-hoc validation by linguistic experts or crowd workers."

        "title": "Social-Robot-Guided Adaptive Data Augmentation for Adult Learners in Low-Resource Languages",
        "Problem_Statement": "Data scarcity in low-resource languages significantly limits the effectiveness of large language models for natural language processing tasks. Traditional augmentation methods often generate synthetic data that lack contextual relevance, diversity, and adaptability to the nuanced linguistic features of these languages, particularly for adult second-language learners.",
        "Motivation": "To transcend the limitations of existing augmentation approaches, this project merges social robotics, second language acquisition theories, and social neuroscience insights to create a socio-cognitive AI system. By leveraging human-robot interaction dynamics proven to enhance engagement, and tailoring them to adult low-resource language learners, the approach fosters production of contextually rich, linguistically nuanced synthetic data that not only augments training corpora but also facilitates measurable language learning outcomes. This integration positions the system beyond a conventional data augmentation pipeline, empowering interactive, adaptive, and socially informed language learning experiences.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an interactive social robot simulation platform embedding adaptive dialogue systems inspired by social neuroscience principles of human-robot interaction and adult second language acquisition models. This platform engages native or proxy speakers and adult learners in iterative conversational sessions where user inputs generate paraphrases, corrections, and contextual scenario variants. A dynamic mechanism captures explicit user feedback signals (e.g., satisfaction ratings, correction acceptances) and implicit engagement metrics, which feed into multi-objective optimization algorithms adjusting augmentation strategies in real-time. Simultaneously, the platform evaluates downstream model performance improvements to iteratively refine augmentation policies. By employing fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), the system identifies optimal interaction patterns and augmentation rules maximizing linguistic nuance capture and diversity. This feedback-driven pipeline ensures high-quality, diverse, and learner-relevant synthetic data, differentiating it fundamentally from conventional human-in-the-loop approaches and enhancing applicability for adult low-resource language learners.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Design the social robot simulation interface incorporating socially attuned adaptive dialogue mechanisms informed by robotics and social neuroscience research; 2. Recruit native or proxy speakers and adult low-resource language learners to engage in interactive sessions generating synthetic data; 3. Implement algorithms to capture, quantify, and integrate explicit and implicit user feedback dynamically into augmentation pipelines using multi-objective optimization and fsQCA analytics; 4. Fine-tune baseline large language models with the augmented data and evaluate on standard low-resource NLP benchmarks and language learning assessment metrics; 5. Conduct comparative analyses against static augmentation and conventional human-in-the-loop methods to demonstrate superiority; 6. Assess system impact on user engagement and language acquisition efficacy to establish socio-cognitive benefits.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A simple sentence in a low-resource language submitted by an adult learner; via the social-robot interface, the learner and a native speaker collaboratively generate multiple context-aware paraphrases and culturally relevant elaborations. Output: A linguistically diverse, user-validated synthetic dataset that boosts downstream task accuracy (e.g., translation, NER) and is coupled with metrics showing improved learner engagement and language retention rates.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should the interactive user-driven augmentation fail to consistently produce high-quality data, transition to a semi-automated pipeline involving post-hoc validation and refinement by linguistic experts and crowdworkers. Additionally, incorporate passive learner interaction data as a supplementary feedback channel to enhance augmentation robustness while maintaining socio-cognitive adaptability."

Detailed mechanisms for capturing, validating, and integrating user feedback dynamically into the augmentation pipeline should be elaborated to establish conceptual soundness and differentiate from conventional human-in-the-loop approaches in NLP data augmentation. Consider specifying algorithms or interaction models that adapt augmentation strategies based on explicit user signals or model performance metrics to solidify the method's rationale and feasibility within the framework of large language models and social robotics principles. This extension will clarify assumptions and operational flow, ensuring the mechanism is not just plausible but grounded in concrete steps and theoretical foundations that the community can evaluate rigorously. Targeting Proposed_Method section for this enhancement is critical to reduce conceptual ambiguity and increase reviewer confidence in the core methodology's soundness and innovativeness."

Leveraging evidence from social neuroscience about human-robot interaction dynamics could help design socially attuned adaptive dialogue mechanisms that enhance user engagement and learning outcomes in the augmentation process. Additionally, incorporating findings from 'second language acquisition' and 'adult learners' would enable tailoring the system specifically for adult low-resource language users, potentially increasing relevance, adoption, and efficacy. This integration can move the project beyond a generative data augmentation tool into a socio-cognitive AI system that not only augments data but also facilitates measurable language learning improvements and user-centered adaptive feedback, thus broadening scientific impact and real-world applicability. Target the Proposed_Method and Motivation sections to embed these concepts, making the approach more holistic and connecting core AI with language learning theory and social robotics insights."
