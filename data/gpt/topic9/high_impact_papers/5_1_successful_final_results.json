    "title": "Explainable Socio-Technical Fairness Framework (ESTFF) for Social Media LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing fairness solutions for social media text analysis lack transparency and fail to incorporate socio-technical factors critical for real-world adoption and ethical deployment.",
    "Motivation": "Directly addresses the gap connecting XAI methods with socio-technical adoption models, promoting transparent and accountable AI systems that consider organizational and societal acceptance—a novel integration opportunity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop ESTFF, a layered framework combining state-of-the-art XAI techniques (e.g., SHAP, counterfactual explanations) with socio-technical modeling (technology acceptance models, organizational behavior theories). The framework generates interpretable fairness assessments and user-centric explanations tailored to stakeholder roles (users, moderators, organizations), facilitating transparent decision-making and trustworthy AI use in social media analysis.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble social media text datasets with fairness annotations. 2) Implement LLM-based bias detection models augmented with XAI explanation modules. 3) Survey organizational stakeholders to identify decision factors for AI adoption. 4) Integrate user feedback through interactive explanation interfaces. 5) Evaluate framework effectiveness using fairness metrics, explanation quality measures, and user trust/acceptance surveys.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Automated bias detection on political posts with controversial language. Output: ESTFF provides explanation highlighting bias features, links these to socio-technical concerns (e.g., potential censorship risk), and adjusts recommendations considering organizational policies to maximize ethical deployment acceptance.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If stakeholder integration proves complex, prototype modular interfaces focusing first on technical explainability, then incrementally incorporate socio-technical features. Use simulations or synthetic feedback to iterate design before full deployment."

        "title": "Explainable Socio-Technical Fairness Framework (ESTFF) for Social Media LLMs with Human-Centered Racial Bias Mitigation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Despite advances in fairness solutions for social media text analysis, existing approaches often lack transparency, fail to rigorously evaluate and integrate socio-technical factors, and inadequately address sensitive issues such as racial disparities, limiting real-world ethical deployment and societal trust.",
        "Motivation": "This work fills a critical gap by tightly coupling state-of-the-art explainable AI (XAI) techniques with robust socio-technical evaluation protocols grounded in human-centered design principles and participatory approaches. By explicitly targeting racial bias mitigation within social media LLMs and embedding iterative stakeholder co-design, the ESTFF aims to achieve unprecedented transparency, fairness, and adoption in ethically complex and socially impactful AI systems. This novel integration differentiates our framework from existing fairness methods by prioritizing replicable socio-technical validation and deeply embedding societal relevance, thus enabling broader and more responsible AI deployment beyond social media, including domains like healthcare decision support.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose ESTFF, a layered, human-centered framework that unites advanced XAI techniques (e.g., SHAP, counterfactual explanations) with socio-technical modeling informed by technology acceptance models, organizational behavior theories, and frameworks for racial disparities. ESTFF explicitly incorporates participatory co-design sessions with diverse stakeholder groups—including communities affected by racial bias—to tailor explanations and mitigation strategies aligned with real-world contexts. To extend societal impact and cross-domain applicability, we draw parallels with clinical decision support systems to iteratively refine trust-building and fairness approaches. The framework produces role-specific, interpretable fairness assessments and explanations that transparently highlight bias features while contextualizing socio-technical concerns such as potential censorship risks and racial disparities. These outputs are coupled with modular, interactive interfaces facilitating user feedback and adoption monitoring across organizational layers, ensuring ethical and socially aware AI deployment in social media LLMs and beyond.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Collection: Compile annotated social media text datasets enriched with fairness labels emphasizing racial bias cases.\n2) Bias Detection & Explanation: Develop LLM-based bias detection models augmented with XAI modules (SHAP, counterfactuals) to generate interpretable outputs.\n3) Rigorous Socio-Technical Protocols: Conduct structured surveys with organizational stakeholders using validated instruments (e.g., Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology scales) and trust measurement scales (e.g., System Trust Scale), quantitatively assessing factors influencing AI adoption.\n4) Participatory Co-Design: Implement iterative workshops with diverse community representatives and stakeholders to co-create explanation interfaces and fairness criteria, capturing qualitative and quantitative feedback.\n5) Integration & Validation: Embed user feedback in modular explanation interfaces, conducting iterative validation cycles starting with controlled lab settings evolving to real-world pilot deployments.\n6) Evaluation Metrics: Employ validated explanation quality metrics (e.g., fidelity, comprehensibility), fairness metrics tailored to socio-technical contexts, and multi-dimensional trust and acceptance surveys.\n7) Cross-Domain Analysis: Apply insights from clinical decision support literature to benchmark and refine framework transferability.\nDetailed data collection protocols, analysis methodologies, and reproducibility documentation will be maintained throughout to ensure scientific rigor and replicability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: Automated bias detection on politically charged social media posts containing racially sensitive language.\nOutput: ESTFF’s explanation highlights key textual features contributing to racial bias predictions, contextualizes these findings within socio-technical factors like community impact and organizational policies to avoid censorship harm, and adapts recommendations in line with co-designed fairness criteria. The modular interface provides different explanation layers tailored for end-users, moderators, and organizational decision-makers, integrating real-time user feedback to continuously improve trust and fairness outcomes.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If engagement with stakeholders and communities proves challenging, adopt a phased modular approach starting with technical explainability components validated via simulated or synthetic user data. Gradually incorporate socio-technical factors using iterative human-in-the-loop simulations and proxy participatory designs, validating framework components independently before full co-design deployment. Additionally, leverage cross-domain analogies from healthcare decision support systems to iteratively refine socio-technical integration strategies."

Specifically, the plan to Survey organizational stakeholders and Integrate user feedback requires more rigorous, replicable protocols to ensure reliability and generalizability of findings. Additionally, methods for measuring explanation quality and user trust should be clearly specified with validated metrics or scales. Providing these details will enhance the feasibility and scientific rigor of the framework's evaluation phases, making deployment and adoption findings more actionable and robust in real-world scenarios. Consider including iterative validation cycles with progressively complex user groups and detailed plans for data collection and analysis in socio-technical modeling steps to strengthen feasibility and reproducibility of the approach within social media LLM contexts.\n\nTarget Section: Experiment_Plan"

For instance, extending the framework to explicitly uncover and mitigate racial biases in social media LLM outputs, informed by human-centered participatory design methods, could differentiate the work from existing fairness approaches. This integration could also involve co-design sessions with affected communities and stakeholders to better align technical explanations with lived experiences, thereby increasing trust and adoption. Additionally, embedding this framework within practical domains like clinical decision support or healthcare outcomes (as analogues) may provide cross-domain insights and wider applicability, increasing the potential impact beyond social media analysis alone.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
