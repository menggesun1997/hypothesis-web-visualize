          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that integrating recurrent modules with transformers will effectively balance real-time latency and contextual understanding on edge LLMs requires stronger justification. Transformers have largely displaced RNNs in many NLP tasks due to superior parallelism and representational power. The claim that recurrent integration inherently improves temporal context modeling and latency on resource-constrained devices lacks empirical or theoretical support here. Clarify why this hybrid architecture is preferable to state-of-the-art lightweight transformer variants or temporal convolutional alternatives, especially given the edge constraints and dynamic IoT data streams. This will strengthen the foundation of your approach and avoid risks of architectural obsolescence or inefficiency at runtime in edge scenarios. Providing preliminary profiling or complexity estimates could help validate this assumption before full experimentation, mitigating development and deployment risks in realistic IoT contexts. Also, explicitly detail how the semi-supervised continual learning scheme avoids catastrophic forgetting or instability on-device under streaming unlabeled data, supporting its robustness claim with literature or initial analysis to confirm its feasibility in this setting. Addressing these assumption gaps is critical to establish the soundness of your method for this challenging application domain and edge setup.  Overall, clarify and justify your architectural and learning design assumptions explicitly to increase confidence and guide experiment design rigorously.  This will elevate both scientific rigor and practical relevance in your proposal's foundation section (Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method).  Without this, risks of unproven assumptions could undermine the entire research endeavor's viability and impact potential, especially as novelty is rated only competitive here, making sound technical groundwork vital for success and acceptance.  Consider adding concise cited evidence or analytical insights on these points to decisively address this code's concerns and improve proposal solidity substantially!  This feedback targets the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections to improve the soundness of foundational assumptions."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The experimental plan, while generally sound, requires more concrete detailing and feasibility considerations to ensure practical realization on resource-constrained edge devices. Step 2's plan to implement a hybrid recurrent-transformer with semi-supervised continual updates on streaming unlabeled input is ambitious, yet the experimental description lacks specifics on critical evaluation metrics and system setup details. How will on-device computing constraints (memory, CPU/GPU, power) be simulated or measured in Step 4? What is the exact mechanism to update model parameters online without compromising latency goals (<100ms)? Semi-supervised continual learning often entails complex update schedules and memory management; these design choices should be explicitly enumerated. Also, Step 1 presumes an established dataset conversion—clarify the process and justification to transform sensor readings into NLP tasks distinctly and reproducibly. Providing benchmark baselines for latency and accuracy must come with a defined experimental protocol including hyperparameter tuning, reproducibility measures, and statistical robustness checks. For the fallback plan, pre-specifying criteria for triggering alternate mechanisms and the evaluation procedures for deciding their superiority is necessary to avoid ambiguities in adaptation strategy. Overall, expand your experimental plan to include detailed resource profiling, real-time latency measurements under realistic streaming conditions, and clear quantitative evaluation metrics for adaptability, robustness, and computational efficiency on edge hardware to firm up feasibility confidently. Strengthening these aspects against practical constraints will raise the work’s credibility and reproducibility potential, an essential step given the cutting-edge application context and complex method integration. This feedback primarily targets the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section to enhance experiment feasibility and clarity."
