    "Problem_Statement": "Data scarcity on IoT edge domains leads to poor LLM adaptability and performance degradation post-compression.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses external data scarcity gap by exploiting semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation techniques, extending Opportunity 1 by synthesizing cross-domain synthetic data with minimal labeling.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a data augmentation pipeline leveraging semi-supervised GANs to generate context-relevant synthetic textual data for unlabeled IoT domains. Use this augmented data to fine-tune compressed LLMs with transfer learning, enhancing performance despite limited real labels.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Identify IoT NLP tasks with sparse labeled datasets. 2) Train GANs conditioned on available unlabeled domain data to produce synthetic text. 3) Augment training with generated data and fine-tune compressed LLMs. 4) Evaluate gains over baselines without augmentation and fully labeled sets. 5) Metrics: accuracy, data efficiency, compression impact.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Few labeled smart factory voice commands and large unlabeled command logs. Expected Output: Augmented dataset expands coverage enabling compressed LLM model to accurately classify commands with fewer real labels.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If GANs produce low-quality synthetic data, incorporate filtering using pretrained discriminators or adopt alternative augmentation methods like back-translation or synonym replacement."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section should provide more clarity on the semi-supervised GAN design and conditioning. Specifically, it is unclear how GANs will generate contextually relevant and semantically coherent synthetic textual data for diverse IoT edge domains, which are typically text- and noise-sensitive. Moreover, the mechanism for integrating the augmented data into the compressed LLM fine-tuning pipeline needs more explicit explanation, including how domain shifts are handled and what transfer learning strategy is employed. Without these details, the soundness of performance improvement claims is questionable and may lead to replication or feasibility issues. A more detailed architectural and algorithmic description is recommended, possibly including ablation studies or uncertainty quantification on generated data quality to substantiate soundness and reproducibility of results. This will strengthen the mechanistic justification and feasibility of the approach's core innovation and improve reviewer confidence in the methodâ€™s soundness and reliability in edge LLM optimization scenarios."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and the availability of Globally-Linked Concepts, the proposal would benefit significantly by integrating graph neural networks (GNNs) or graph representation learning to enhance cross-domain data augmentation. For example, representing IoT commands, logs, or related contextual information as graph-structured data could exploit underlying relational information that conventional GAN-based text generation might miss. This may improve synthetic data quality and domain adaptation fidelity, thereby addressing performance bottlenecks under constrained labeled data. Additionally, coupling transformer architectures with graph-based representations could increase model robustness and open pathways for few-shot or self-supervised learning strategies within the compressed LLM fine-tuning pipeline. This integration can broaden the impact beyond basic text augmentation by enabling more nuanced representation learning attuned to IoT semantic structures, ultimately raising both the novelty and practical effectiveness of the research."
