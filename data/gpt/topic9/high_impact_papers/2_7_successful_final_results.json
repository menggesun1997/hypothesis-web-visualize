    "title": "Hybrid Rule-LLM System for Ethical Dialogue Management in Healthcare Conversational AI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Pure LLM-based conversational agents risk generating unethical or biased content without real-time corrective mechanisms tailored for healthcare dialogs.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap concerning ethics and transparency by creating a hybrid system where symbolic rule-based ethical constraints guide and correct LLM-generated conversational responses dynamically.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a dialogue management pipeline where the LLM proposes responses and a symbolic ethical reasoner verifies and modifies outputs based on a formalized healthcare ethics knowledge base and critical language norms before user delivery.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop or adopt a healthcare ethical ontology encoding core values and norms. 2. Implement the symbolic reasoner integrated with an open-domain LLM. 3. Test on datasets with known ethical challenge cases in healthcare dialogs. 4. Evaluate success by measuring decreases in flagged unethical or biased outputs.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient asks about off-label drug use. The LLM replies with cautious medical advice. The ethical reasoner adds disclaimers and modifies any inappropriate claims before output.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If symbolic reasoner delays response excessively, apply real-time ethical monitoring post-generation with automatic rollback mechanisms. Utilize simpler rule sets for critical areas only."

        "title": "Multi-Agent Hybrid Ethical Dialogue Management with Dynamic Knowledge Governance for Healthcare Conversational AI",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large language model (LLM)-based conversational agents in healthcare risk generating unethical or biased responses without effective real-time correction and transparency, impeding trust and safety in sensitive clinical dialogs.",
        "Motivation": "While hybrid rule-LLM systems have shown promise for ethical constraints in dialogue, current approaches lack dynamic integration mechanisms and scalability within evolving healthcare contexts, limiting robustness and adaptability. This proposal advances beyond static pipelines by designing a modular multi-agent system embedding a symbolic ethical reasoning agent with dynamic knowledge management and interactive protocol governance. This novel architecture enables transparent, real-time conflict resolution between probabilistic LLM outputs and formal ethical rules, fostering trustworthy, explainable AI-driven healthcare communication. It addresses competitiveness gaps by integrating advanced multi-agent coordination and knowledge lifecycle techniques rarely explored together in healthcare conversational AI.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a multi-agent dialogue ecosystem comprising: (1) an LLM dialogue agent generating medical conversational candidates; (2) a specialized symbolic Ethical Reasoner Agent (ERA) implementing a formal healthcare ethics ontology and dynamic language norms; and (3) a Knowledge Governance Agent (KGA) overseeing continuous updates, auditing, and fine-grained versioning of ethical knowledge and reasoning logs. The system orchestrates via a defined interaction protocol including: a. ERA intercepts each LLM candidate response, formally verifies compliance; b. In case of conflicts or ambiguity, ERA engages KGA to consult parameterized ethical guidelines and update ontology if new scenario patterns arise; c. ERA modifies or annotates responses with explainable flags rather than simple filtering, enabling user-understandable ethical rationales; d. Latency management is ensured by parallel agent pipelines and predefined time-budget heuristics triggering fallback simplified ethical-validation rules when needed. The modular and scalable architecture allows flexible addition of further agents for special clinical domains or language styles, promoting continual ethical learning and governance.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop a comprehensive formal healthcare ethical ontology and language norm models, encoding core values, rules, and ambiguity resolution strategies; 2. Implement the Ethical Reasoner Agent and define its conflict-resolution protocols with LLM outputs and Knowledge Governance Agent; 3. Build the Knowledge Governance Agent integrating version control, auditing capabilities, and mechanisms for ethical ontology updates informed by new dialogue events; 4. Integrate agents within a simulated multi-agent dialogue management platform enabling controlled experiments; 5. Benchmark the system on healthcare conversational datasets involving ethically challenging scenarios, measuring reduction of unethical or biased responses, system latency, explainability of ethical interventions, and adaptability over iterative updates; 6. Conduct user studies with healthcare professionals evaluating trustworthiness, clarity of ethical explanations, and overall dialogue quality.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: Patient inquires about off-label drug use. LLM generates informative response. ERA detects potential ethical risk due to insufficient disclaimers; consults KGA which references updated guidelines on off-label disclosure; ERA augments response with an explicit disclaimer and explanation to the user. Example 2: Patient asks about sensitive mental health advice with indirect cues. ERA identifies ambiguity and potential conflict between LLMâ€™s probabilistic output and ethical rule exceptions; triggers interactive protocol to propose alternative safe responses with justification accessible to human reviewers. Examples will illustrate real-time ethical reasoning, explainability flags, and multi-agent interaction logs.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "To mitigate response latency from complex ethical reasoning, implement priority-based timeouts whereby ERA defaults to a critical subset of high-impact ethical rules for rapid post-processing. KGA will monitor fallback activations and flag cases for offline review and ontology refinement, ensuring safety without compromising dialogue responsiveness. Additionally, incorporate user-configurable ethical strictness levels to adjust system reactivity and complexity as per clinical urgency contexts."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes a symbolic ethical reasoner that modifies or verifies LLM outputs using a healthcare ethics knowledge base. However, the mechanism lacks clarity on how conflicts between the LLM's probabilistic outputs and the symbolic rules are resolved in real time. Furthermore, the integration pipeline and its latency management are not detailed, which is critical for interactive dialogue in healthcare. The proposal should concretely specify the interaction protocol between the LLM and the ethical reasoner, including handling ambiguity and reasoning explainability to users, to strengthen soundness and trustworthiness of the system behavior in sensitive healthcare contexts. Clarifying these aspects will better demonstrate the method's robustness and rationale under diverse, possibly conflicting inputs from patients and providers, enabling an effective dynamic correction setup rather than a simple post-hoc filter or overlay."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty rating as NOV-COMPETITIVE in a crowded convergence space of ethical AI and conversational systems, the idea could substantially improve impact and distinctiveness by incorporating concepts from the linked 'multi-agent systems' and 'knowledge management'. For example, structuring the ethical reasoner as a specialized agent within a multi-agent dialogue ecosystem could enable modular, scalable ethical monitoring and dynamic knowledge sharing across agents in complex healthcare scenarios. Leveraging advanced knowledge management techniques to maintain, update, and audit the ethical ontology and reasoning logs could enhance transparency and adaptability over time. Embedding these globally referenced concepts promises to elevate the system beyond static hybrid pipelines into a more generalizable, robust architecture fostering continual learning, ethical governance, and interoperability in healthcare conversational AI."
