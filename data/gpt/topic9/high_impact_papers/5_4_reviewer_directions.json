    "title": "Cross-Domain Transfer Learning from Forensic Psychiatry for Emotion-aware Bias Mitigation in Social Media LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs for social media text analysis lack nuanced emotion recognition in bias detection, limiting detection of affective-driven biases.",
    "Motivation": "Exploits underexplored intersection with forensic psychiatry and emotion recognition to improve bias mitigation by incorporating subtle emotional and psychological signals—a novel, bold cross-disciplinary synthesis.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement a transfer learning approach where emotion recognition models trained on forensic psychiatric transcripts are adapted into social media LLM pipelines. Combined with emotion-aware attention modules, the model detects bias amplified or driven by emotional context and corrects outputs accordingly to enhance fairness and sensitivity.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Source forensic psychiatry datasets focusing on emotional-laden text and annotate emotions and biases. 2) Pretrain emotion recognition modules; adapt via transfer learning on social media datasets with labeled bias and emotion tags. 3) Integrate into transformer LLMs with emotion-aware bias mitigation layers. 4) Evaluate improvements on fairness and emotion-sensitive bias detection metrics compared to non-emotion aware baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Social media post exhibiting subtle anger toward marginalized groups. Output: Emotion-aware module identifies affective bias, model adjusts analysis to flag and reduce bias impact, yielding more responsible interpretation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If transfer learning yields domain mismatch, explore joint multi-task learning on combined datasets or semi-supervised fine-tuning with emotion and bias labels to improve adaptation."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The premise that forensic psychiatry emotion recognition models can seamlessly transfer to social media contexts requires stronger justification. Forensic psychiatry texts are highly specialized, clinical, and typically formal, whereas social media language is informal, diverse, and full of slang, sarcasm, and contextual nuances. This domain mismatch risks limited transferability of emotional signals, which could weaken bias detection performance. Strengthen the assumptions by analyzing linguistic and emotional feature overlap and articulating how the subtle psychological signals can generalize or be adapted between domains without losing critical context or inducing noise in emotion recognition relevant to bias detection on social media data. Provide evidence or preliminary analysis to support this key cross-domain assumption, or clarify the limits and domain adaptation strategies explicitly to improve soundness and credibility of the core idea. It’s crucial to demonstrate that the foundational assumption of forensic psychiatry emotion models helping social media bias mitigation is theoretically and practically plausible before proceeding further with the complex transfer learning approaches proposed in the method and experiments sections, as these depend heavily on this assumption being valid and feasible in practice. Consider dedicated empirical or theoretical groundwork to validate this core assumption upfront in the next iteration of the proposal rather than relying solely on the fallback plan for domain mismatch later on. This will strengthen the reviewer's confidence in the overall method soundness and feasibility of the project and reduce risk of failure due to domain mismatch issues later in the process, especially in light of the highly competitive novelty space currently identified by the pre-screening assessment. Target section: Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method, as these contain the core assumptions currently vulnerable to question in cross-domain applicability between forensic psychiatry and social media contexts. This is the top priority issue to address to establish the research approach's validity and set a solid foundation for subsequent experimental work and ultimate impact claims. Addressing this first is critical for the submission's credibility and competitiveness in a premier conference setting, given the novelty competition context and inter-disciplinary challenges present here to transfer emotional modeling between disparate language domains for bias mitigation tasks with emotion-aware LLMs on social media data. Tackling this assumption head-on will provide a rigorous clear basis from which the rest of the work flows logically and plausibly, increasing the strength of the overall proposal far beyond a mere interdisciplinary combination towards a truly integrated, reasoned, and impactful innovation that can stand peer scrutiny and advance the state of the art in bias-aware social media LLMs underpinned by forensic psychiatry insights and models. This critique supersedes other structural or broad-scoped impact critiques because it goes to the heart of methodology and risk, and directly influences feasibility and potential impact alike."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE, to enhance both impact and novelty, incorporate concepts from global interdisciplinary AI advances such as generative AI and assistive technology. For example, propose integrating the emotion-aware bias mitigation model within generative AI frameworks used in social media content moderation or assistive technology applications (e.g., tools supporting mental health or marginalized communities online). This would broaden the scope, increase real-world applicability, and align the research with cutting-edge AI developments, thereby addressing the competitive area by proposing a more comprehensive, socially valuable system. Moreover, outlining collaboration with international interdisciplinary groups or standards (potentially linking indirectly with organizations like the International Union of Nutritional Sciences through health-related AI applications) can open novel impact pathways and cross-domain validation opportunities. Explicitly framing the research in this larger AI ecosystem context leverages globally linked concepts to differentiate the work and create avenues for translational benefits beyond academic novelty—making the idea more attractive for top-tier conferences concerned with broader societal and technological relevance. This strategic alignment should be mentioned in the motivation or future work to emphasize enhanced relevance and integrated global AI perspectives."
