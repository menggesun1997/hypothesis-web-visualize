        "title": "LLM-Powered Clinician Communication Coaching Agent Embedded in Evidence-Based Health Professions Education Frameworks",
        "Problem_Statement": "Clinicians face challenges in acquiring timely, actionable feedback on their communication skills during patient interactions, which can detrimentally affect care quality, patient comprehension, and satisfaction. Current tools are limited in real-time adaptability, evidence grounding, and ethical transparency, reducing their effectiveness in fostering lasting communication improvements.",
        "Motivation": "To address the NOV-COMPETITIVE landscape of AI-enabled clinician communication interventions, this proposal integrates state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) with established, internationally recognized health professions education frameworks and communication competency standards. Grounding AI coaching in evidence-based pedagogical practices and international guidelines enhances novelty, ethical transparency, and clinician acceptance. Additionally, incorporating elements inspired by mental health chatbot adaptability enables nuanced, emotion-sensitive feedback, broadening applicability for sensitive clinical conversations and increasing overall impact. This interdisciplinary approach simultaneously advances AI-driven communication coaching and bridges gaps in healthcare education by fostering trust, transparency, and pedagogical rigor.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid AI coaching agent that leverages an LLM augmented with domain-specific discourse and empathy analysis calibrated against internationally recognized health communication competency frameworks (e.g., ACGME, CANMEDS, and WHO communication guidelines). The system will incorporate validated rubric-based annotation schemas derived from these frameworks for detecting communication behaviors relevant to empathy, clarity, jargon usage, and adaptability in sensitive consultations. To enhance flexibility and relevance in diverse clinical settings, adaptive coaching modules inspired by mental health chatbots’ conversational sensitivity will enable personalized feedback responsive to emotional cues. The architecture unites critical language awareness algorithms, pedagogy-aligned coaching logic, and LLM generative capabilities, allowing the agent to produce context-aware, actionable, and ethically transparent feedback that aligns with well-established professional development standards.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Acquisition and Ethical Compliance: Collaborate with clinical education centers and institutional review boards to collect a diverse, de-identified dataset of audio-visual recorded clinician-patient conversations along with transcripts. Ensure participants’ informed consent specifying research use and privacy safeguards. Target a sample size of at least 200 recordings balanced across specialties and patient demographics.\n\n2. Annotation and Schema Development: Develop a detailed annotation manual based on international health communication competency frameworks and published empathy coding manuals. Train a team of expert annotators (clinical educators, communication specialists) to label communication behaviors, empathy indicators, and jargon instances. Assess inter-rater reliability with Cohen's Kappa > 0.75.\n\n3. Model Training and Validation: Use annotated data to train the AI system to detect communication patterns and empathy signals. Implement multi-label classifiers combined with LLM prompts fine-tuned on clinical communication corpora. Validate detection accuracy via cross-validation, targeting precision and recall rates above 0.85 for key communication behaviors.\n\n4. Coaching Feedback Generation: Design feedback generation mechanisms that map detected behaviors onto coaching messages grounded in educational standards. Generate example feedback for both real-time and post-session scenarios.\n\n5. Controlled Pilot Intervention: Conduct a randomized controlled trial involving 60 clinicians split into intervention and control groups. Intervention clinicians will use the coaching agent over 8 weeks, receiving either real-time or post-session feedback based on a predefined system performance threshold (e.g., confidence score > 0.8 for real-time use). Control group continues usual practice.\n\n6. Outcome Measurement: Evaluate clinician communication improvement using blinded expert ratings pre- and post-intervention, patient satisfaction surveys, and clinician user satisfaction scales (validated instruments with Likert scoring). Employ statistical analyses comparing groups, incorporating effect sizes and confidence intervals.\n\n7. Iterative Usability Testing: Before and during the pilot, integrate iterative user-centered design cycles to refine interface usability and acceptability, deploying standardized usability questionnaires (e.g., SUS) and qualitative interviews.\n\nFallback and Transition Plan: Define system performance thresholds at model confidence levels and user preference inputs to adaptively switch feedback modes between real-time and post-session coaching, ensuring seamless user experience and data reliability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Transcript segment where clinician says, \"You have a myocardial infarction.\"\nOutput: \"Suggestion: Simplify the term 'myocardial infarction' to 'heart attack' to improve patient understanding and engagement, consistent with CANMEDS communicator role guidelines.\"\n\nInput: Clinician shows abrupt tone during a patient's expression of anxiety.\nOutput: \"Feedback: Consider a more empathetic response to acknowledge patient distress, as recommended in international empathy competency frameworks, to foster therapeutic rapport.\"\n\nInput: A conversation involving emotionally sensitive disclosures.\nOutput: \"Adaptive module activated: Provide gentle, supportive feedback tailored to the emotional content, inspired by mental health chatbot conversational best practices, promoting clinician mindful responsiveness.\"",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Implement a robust fallback strategy based on quantifiable system confidence metrics and clinician preferences. When real-time feedback confidence falls below a 0.8 threshold or when clinicians opt out of live coaching, the system will automatically switch to generating comprehensive, post-session feedback reports. Additionally, if the LLM encounters domain-specific nuance challenges, the system will activate fallback heuristics derived from rigorous, rule-based clinical communication guidelines aligned with international pedagogical standards. Continuous monitoring of system performance and user feedback across versions will guide iterative enhancements and recalibration of these fallback transitions."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks clarity and detail on several critical feasibility aspects. Specifically, the plan to assemble audio-visual recordings and transcripts with expert communication ratings is a challenging and resource-intensive task that needs explicit data sourcing strategies and ethical considerations addressed upfront. Moreover, training the system to accurately detect empathy signals and communication patterns requires well-defined annotation schemas and validation protocols, which are not described. The evaluation metrics mentioned (precision, recall, user satisfaction) are appropriate but would benefit from more precise operationalization (e.g., what constitutes ground truth, how satisfaction is measured, sample sizes). Pilot interventions should also incorporate control groups or randomized designs to robustly measure improvement over time. Enhancing this section with more concrete methodological details and contingency plans will strengthen the proposal’s feasibility significantly.\n\nFurthermore, the fallback plan is sensible but could better specify how and when to transition between real-time and post-session feedback, including system performance thresholds or clinician preferences. Incorporating iterative user testing phases could also improve system usability and acceptance before large-scale pilots. Addressing these feasibility concerns will increase confidence in the research execution and outcomes' reliability and validity.\n\nIn summary, the experiment plan needs deeper elaboration on data collection, annotation, validation, and rigorous experimental design to be truly feasible and scientifically robust, vital for success in this competitive research space.\n\nSuggestion: Elaborate data acquisition, annotation protocols, exact evaluation metrics, and pilot study design with comparative controls or baselines explicit in the Experiment_Plan section to improve clarity and feasibility assumptions.\n\nTarget Section: Experiment_Plan"
