    "Problem_Statement": "Parameter-efficient tuning of large language models for low-resource languages suffers from inefficiencies and lack of systematic deployment strategies, limiting practical usability in real-world settings.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the internal gap of parameter-efficient tuning (delta-tuning) in multilingual contexts by integrating healthcare implementation science frameworks (e.g., Quality Implementation Framework) promises systematic, accountable model adaptation and deployment strategies, a niche currently unexplored.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a novel adaptive tuning framework embedding the steps and quality assurance metrics from healthcare implementation science into delta-tuning processes. This includes meta-planning phases, continuous monitoring, feedback loops, and stakeholder involvement stages translated into DL model-finetuning protocols. Implementation integrates these stages with scalable cloud infrastructure to enable transparent parameter-efficient tuning customized per language domain.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select benchmark low-resource language datasets (e.g., Masakhane datasets). 2. Implement baseline delta-tuning methods using pretrained LLMs like mT5 or mBERT. 3. Embed Quality Implementation Framework stages into training loop controlling hyperparameters, monitoring adaptation metrics, and audit logging. 4. Evaluate performance on standard NLP tasks (NER, POS, MT), analyze tuning efficiency, and conduct qualitative interpretability assessments. 5. Compare deployment reproducibility and accountability against baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A Swahili sentence for NER task. Expected Output: Entities correctly recognized with model parameters selectively adapted using the adaptive framework, with interpretability reports showing tuning rationale and deployment steps logged for accountability.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct embedding of QoI frameworks into tuning disrupts optimization, alternate strategy is to decouple implementation science as a meta-layer for model monitoring and post-hoc auditing instead of within-loop adaptation controls."

        "title": "Healthcare-Inspired Adaptive Tuning Framework with Privacy-Aware Human-in-the-Loop for Low-Resource Languages",
        "Problem_Statement": "Parameter-efficient tuning of large language models (LLMs) for low-resource languages remains challenging due to inefficient adaptation strategies, lack of standardized deployment protocols, and inadequate mechanisms for accountability, interpretability, and privacy preservation. These challenges hinder practical, trustworthy application of fine-tuned models in sensitive multilingual healthcare contexts.",
        "Motivation": "While delta-tuning methods have improved resource-efficient adaptation of LLMs, existing approaches often overlook systematic, accountable deployment processes that ensure reproducibility, interpretability, and ethical compliance. Inspired by healthcare implementation science frameworks like the Quality Implementation Framework, this research proposes a concrete, mechanistic embedding of these frameworks into LLM tuning pipelines — enhanced further by integrating privacy-preserving auditing and human-computer interaction principles. This combined approach aims to bridge gaps among optimization efficiency, deployment accountability, human stakeholder involvement, and sensitive data privacy concerns, thus advancing the state-of-the-art in multilingual NLP adaptation relevant for real-world, low-resource healthcare applications. This unique interdisciplinary integration distinctly surpasses prior work focused solely on tuning mechanics or deployment policy, making the proposal both novel and societally impactful amid rigorous NOV-COMPETITIVE standards.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a technically explicit Adaptive Delta-Tuning Framework (ADTF) that embeds healthcare implementation science constructs into the LLM fine-tuning loop, augmented with privacy-aware logging and human-in-the-loop oversight drawn from human-computer interaction (HCI) paradigms. The method concretely operationalizes each stage of the Quality Implementation Framework (QIF) as follows:\n\n1. Meta-Planning Phase: Define tuning objectives through stakeholder requirements elicited via interactive HCI sessions, shaping hyperparameter schedules (e.g., learning rates, adaptation gating parameters) using a parameter controller informed by user feedback.\n\n2. Initial Tuning and Implementation: Execute delta-tuning on selected low-resource language datasets (e.g., Masakhane benchmarks) with dynamic hyperparameter adjustment driven by real-time monitoring metrics such as adaptation convergence rate, stability indices, and F-score improvements.\n\n3. Continuous Monitoring and Feedback Loops: Implement automated audit logging capturing parameter update trajectories, adjustment rationales, and performance metrics. Integrated differential privacy mechanisms ensure logging preserves sensitive textual data confidentiality.\n\n4. Stakeholder Involvement and Review: Deploy a human-in-the-loop interface allowing domain experts to review adaptation outcomes, tuning rationales, and audit logs; collected insights feed back to a reinforcement controller that modulates subsequent hyperparameter schedules and model update gating to optimize interpretability and trustworthiness.\n\n5. Accountability and Deployment: Systematize deployment reproducibility through standardized adaptation protocol serialization, combined with privacy-aware auditing to comply with healthcare data privacy standards (e.g., HIPAA-like constraints).\n\nAlgorithmically, at each training iteration, the framework updates a tuning controller module which evaluates monitored signals and stakeholder input to adjust learning rates, selective parameter freezing/unfreezing (adaptation gating), and gradient clipping thresholds, ensuring convergence robustness and mitigating adverse optimization disruptions. Pseudocode and detailed workflow diagrams accompany the framework to enable reproducibility.\n\nThis integration synergizes parameter-efficient tuning with transparent, privacy-preserving audit trails and iterative human oversight, marking a novel convergence of delta-tuning, healthcare implementation science, data privacy, and HCI-driven stakeholder engagement.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Preparation: Gather and preprocess representative low-resource language datasets from the Masakhane project covering diverse NLP tasks (NER, POS tagging, MT).\n\n2. Baseline Setup: Implement standard delta-tuning baselines on pretrained multilingual models like mT5 and mBERT, recording adaptation efficiency and accuracy metrics.\n\n3. Framework Implementation: Develop the Adaptive Delta-Tuning Framework embedding QIF stages, with a tuning controller module integrating hyperparameter schedule adjustments, monitoring components for adaptation metrics, privacy-preserving audit logging, and a human-in-the-loop user interface prototype.\n\n4. Controlled Experiments: Run fine-tuning experiments comparing baseline and ADTF methods focusing on 1) task performance (F-score, accuracy), 2) tuning efficiency (parameter update counts, convergence speed), 3) interpretability assessed via human stakeholder review of audit logs and adaptation rationales, and 4) deployment reproducibility through protocol replay.\n\n5. Privacy and Ethics Evaluation: Verify audit logs comply with differential privacy guarantees, experiment with synthetic privacy attacks to validate robustness.\n\n6. User Studies: Conduct HCI-driven assessments involving domain experts providing feedback on framework usability, trustworthiness, and impact on decision-making.\n\n7. Analysis and Reporting: Compare all results systematically, analyze stakeholder feedback to refine the tuning controller algorithms and human-in-the-loop interfaces.\n\n8. Publish algorithmic specifications, pseudocode, component architectures, and detailed experiment logs for reproducibility and community adoption.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A Swahili sentence in an NER task.\nExpected Output:\n- Correct recognition of named entities with model parameters selectively adapted via ADTF’s controlled tuning schedules.\n- Real-time adaptation metrics indicating stable convergence.\n- Audit logs capturing stepwise parameter changes tagged with privacy-preserving guarantees.\n- Human-in-the-loop interface reports detailing tuning rationale and stakeholder annotations.\n- Deployment scripts reproducing the exact fine-tuned model with documented adjustment protocols.\n\nAdditional test case:\nInput: User feedback from clinical domain experts on tuning interpretability.\nExpected Output:\n- Reinforcement controller incorporating feedback to fine-tune adaptation gating rules, leading to improved model performance and stakeholder trust in subsequent iterations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full in-loop embedding of healthcare frameworks with privacy and human-in-the-loop mechanisms proves optimization-disruptive or technically infeasible, the fallback strategy is to modularize the approach. This entails decoupling healthcare-inspired quality assurance as an external meta-framework focusing on post-hoc auditing and analysis, while maintaining standard delta-tuning algorithms internally. Privacy-aware audit logs and stakeholder feedback interfaces would operate asynchronously outside the training loop to monitor and guide future deployments, thus preserving optimization stability while still enhancing accountability and usability. We will iteratively explore hybrid designs balancing integration and modularization to ensure feasibility and impact."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an ambitious integration of healthcare implementation science frameworks into delta-tuning of LLMs, but it lacks a clear, concrete technical description of how specific steps (meta-planning, monitoring, feedback loops, stakeholder involvement) map to concrete tuning algorithms or training control mechanisms. Clarify the mechanisms by which these frameworks concretely modify hyperparameter schedules, adaptation gating, or model parameter updates, and how these integration points preserve or improve optimization convergence. Without these details, the approach risks being conceptually appealing but difficult to implement effectively or evaluate rigorously. A detailed workflow or algorithmic pseudo-code would greatly enhance clarity and soundness of the method's mechanism section in Proposed_Method. This is critical since the novelty relies on this new cross-disciplinary methodology embedding, and its current vagueness weakens reproducibility and confidence in feasibility as well as soundness of the approach's core assumption that healthcare frameworks can be operationalized in this context effectively. Please elaborate this aspect substantially before proceeding further. This is a MUST fix to solidify the submission's foundations and enable meaningful evaluation and adoption in real-world NLP deployments for low-resource languages, where accountability and transparency is vital but also non-trivial to engineer within tuning loops effectively. Addressing this will also map directly to more targeted experiments and auditing protocols in the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section and improve the clarity and scientific rigor overall in the manuscript or proposal's methodological backbone (Proposed_Method). This is the fundamental technical gap to resolve first to avoid vagueness and conceptual confusion on key claims of the work's novelty and feasibility in real settings—without this, downstream impact and deployment claims become speculative at best. Thus, it requires an explicit, systematic technical operationalization of healthcare implementation stages within model tuning loops, not just an abstract analogy or high-level conceptual overlay. Please strengthen this critical section with precise technical details and concrete algorithmic design specifications, since that is the keystone for assessing soundness and practical feasibility of this innovative approach. This feedback focuses on the 'Proposed_Method' section specifically, to improve the model adaptation methodology’s clarity and rigor prior to substantial experiments or broad impact claims. This revision is essential before advancing to later phases or impact extensions."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and the current proposal's strong interdisciplinary focus, a highly effective next step is to link this framework more explicitly with data privacy and human-computer interaction dimensions, which are critical in multilingual and healthcare-related NLP applications. For instance, integrating privacy-preserving techniques or auditing protocols that leverage the healthcare-inspired accountability framework could widen impact and novelty. Adding a user-in-the-loop or human-robot interaction-inspired stakeholder feedback mechanism overseeing tuning could enhance interpretability and trustworthiness, thereby bridging model adaptation with real-world deployment concerns. Specifically, consideration of concepts such as 'data privacy concerns' and 'human-computer interaction' from the globally linked concepts list could enable innovative contributions addressing not just parameter-efficient adaptation but also ethical, user-experience, and privacy constraints critical to low-resource healthcare settings. This could further differentiate the work by coupling adaptive tuning methods with transparent, privacy-aware deployment monitoring that both respects sensitive data and fosters stakeholder engagement, increasing societal and practical impact. This strategic integration would boost the ambitious vision and strengthen competitiveness in a crowded area, paving the way for research that impacts not only model efficiency but also trust, usability, and compliance aspects increasingly demanded in both AI and healthcare fields. A concrete suggestion includes augmenting the adaptive tuning framework with privacy-aware logging and human-in-the-loop auditing mechanisms inspired by human-computer interaction and electronic health records management, thereby enabling end-to-end responsible adaptation workflows for low-resource languages. This feedback targets expanding the project's scope and novelty leveraging globally-linked concepts to maximize its relevance and competitiveness moving forward."
