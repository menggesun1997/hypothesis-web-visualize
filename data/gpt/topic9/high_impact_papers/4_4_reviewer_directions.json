    "title": "Adaptive Edge LLMs with Federated Knowledge Distillation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Personalized NLP tasks on edge IoT devices require efficient model adaptation while preserving privacy and computational budgets.",
    "Motivation": "Bridges gaps in federated learning and knowledge distillation by integrating them into edge-tailored LLM optimization frameworks, responding to the siloed development gap and recognition of sociotechnical factors.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an adaptive federated learning system where edge devices perform local knowledge distillation on compressed LLMs, sharing distilled knowledge (not data) to a central server to aggregate a global, efficient model. The system leverages semi-supervised learning for unlabeled local data to improve personalization and compression.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Simulate IoT edge network with heterogeneous devices and datasets. 2) Implement federated distillation protocol with local semi-supervised fine-tuning. 3) Monitor global model improvement over rounds, measuring accuracy, privacy (no raw data sharing), and inference efficiency. 4) Compare against centralized training and non-distilled federated setups.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multiple edge smart devices with diverse user command datasets, some unlabeled. Expected Output: A shared compressed LLM model personalized for each edge device, demonstrating improved accuracy and efficiency without compromising privacy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated distillation communication overhead is high, optimize message compression or utilize asynchronous update schemes. Alternatively, explore split learning methods for privacy and efficiency."

          "feedback_content": "While the high-level approach to federated knowledge distillation for adaptive edge LLMs is promising, the methodology lacks detailed clarification on key mechanisms. Specifically, it needs to define how local knowledge distillation operates on compressed LLMs with semi-supervised learning, how exactly distilled knowledge is represented and aggregated centrally, and how compression affects model capacity and personalization trade-offs. Elaborating these mechanisms will strengthen the soundness by demonstrating rigorous, plausible integration of federated learning with knowledge distillation under resource constraints and privacy guarantees, rather than remaining a conceptual proposal without operational specifics. Suggest inclusion of technical designs or algorithms for knowledge sharing, distillation loss functions, and compression strategies to clarify feasibility and innovation beyond incremental combinations of existing methods.\n\n--- Target Section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty assessment places this work as NOV-COMPETITIVE in a mature area, consider integrating concepts from the 'privacy-accuracy trade-off' and 'differential privacy' domains to augment privacy guarantees without compromising model utility. Embedding rigorous differential privacy mechanisms directly in the federated distillation pipeline can distinctly improve the work's originality and impact. Additionally, exploring 'semantic communication' techniques for compressing and transmitting distilled knowledge could further reduce communication overhead while preserving critical information fidelity. This globally informed integration will enhance the framework's practical viability on resource-constrained IoT devices and demonstrate cutting-edge contributions contextualized within broader AI and privacy-preserving trends, thus addressing competitive novelty concerns and augmenting overall impact.\n\n--- Target Section: Proposed_Method"
