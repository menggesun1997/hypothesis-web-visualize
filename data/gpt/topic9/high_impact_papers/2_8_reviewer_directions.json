    "title": "Adaptive Real-Time Conversational AI for Dynamic Healthcare Organizational Change Processes",
    "Problem_Statement": "Healthcare organizations undergoing digital transformation lack conversational AI tools that adapt in real-time to evolving workflows and communication needs during change processes.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the underutilized systematic evaluation methods of digital transformation within healthcare when integrating AI, linking organizational change discourse with adaptive conversational AI capabilities as highlighted in current landscape and gaps.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an adaptive LLM-driven conversational agent equipped with an organizational change model that continuously monitors communication patterns and organizational signals to tailor AI responses and coaching to emergent needs over transformation phases.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Model organizational change stages with annotated communications from healthcare transformations. 2. Integrate this model with a conversational AI capable of real-time self-adjustment. 3. Deploy in simulated organizational change environments and collect communication effectiveness metrics. 4. Iterate on agent adaptability and impact on workflow efficiency.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Staff queries about new EHR workflows during early implementation stage. AI adapts tone to reassuring coaching with clear explanations referencing current change phase.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time adaptation is computationally heavy, implement batch-mode context update between shifts or sessions. Use simpler adaptation heuristics based on key transformation indicators."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that communication patterns and organizational signals can be effectively captured and accurately interpreted in real time to inform adaptive LLM behavior. However, the variability and complexity inherent in healthcare organizational change communications—often involving unstructured, implicit, and multi-modal cues—pose substantial challenges to this assumption. Clarify how the model concretely identifies and differentiates these signals robustly across diverse contexts and roles, and provide preliminary evidence or references supporting the validity of this core premise to strengthen the soundness of the proposed method's foundation, especially given the critical role these signals play in the system's adaptability and effectiveness during transformation phases. Without this, the fundamental adaptability mechanism risks being unreliable or oversimplified, undermining the whole approach's feasibility and impact potential in complex healthcare settings, where communication nuances deeply influence change management success.  This clarification will ensure confidence in the approach’s underlying assumptions before one invests in costly deployments or iterative development cycles tied to these communication dynamics. Target this critique first to fortify the methodology's foundational soundness before exploring implementation details further in experiment design and scalability considerations.  (Target section: Proposed_Method)  "

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The experimental plan includes logically sequential steps but lacks detail on key feasibility aspects such as data availability, annotation processes, and metrics operationalization. For example: How will annotated communications be sourced at scale from real healthcare digital transformation projects given typical data sensitivity and heterogeneity? What precise metrics will measure 'communication effectiveness' and 'workflow efficiency', and how will these be quantitatively linked to adaptive AI interventions? Also, the plan should clarify simulation fidelity—does it incorporate realistic organizational constraints and stakeholder variability, or rely on synthetic scenarios? Addressing these feasibility gaps by elaborating on data acquisition strategies, annotation schema, evaluation criteria, and realistic simulation parameters will enable a scientifically sound, reproducible experimental pipeline that convincingly validates adaptability and impact claims. Failure to operationalize this plan concretely risks the work becoming a conceptual demonstration without empirical backing, limiting its credibility and influence. Strengthening this section first ensures groundwork to substantiate effectiveness, informing iterative improvements in system design grounded in measurable outcomes.  (Target section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)"
