    "title": "Adaptive User-Centered LLM Explanations for Judges via Human-in-the-Loop Feedback",
    "Problem_Statement": "Legal professionals such as judges face challenges interpreting static, one-size-fits-all explanations from LLMs, limiting trust and usability in legal document analysis workflows.",
    "Motivation": "This idea fills the external gap linking 'education' and 'field of XAI' by designing adaptive explanation systems that evolve with direct input from legal users, enabling personalized comprehensibility and fostering trust. The novelty lies in applying human-in-the-loop adaptation to generate stakeholder-specific, evolving explanations based on continuous feedback.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an interactive explainability interface that incorporates user feedback from judges on explanation clarity, relevance, and sufficiency. Use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to adapt explanation generation policies, tuning explanation granularity and modality (e.g., textual, visual, semantic highlighting) dynamically per user profile and interaction history. The system learns to personalize explanations in real-time, improving interpretability and acceptance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop prototype interactive explanation UI targeting judges. 2. Collect initial explanation examples from baseline LLM outputs with existing XAI techniques. 3. Recruit legal professionals for feedback sessions annotating explanation preferences. 4. Train RLHF models to optimize explanation generation guided by this feedback. 5. Evaluate improvements in interpretability, user trust, and task performance via controlled user studies comparing static vs. adaptive explanations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Legal brief summary generated by LLM with explanation. Judge provides feedback that explanations are too technical. Output: System generates simplified explanations emphasizing key reasoning steps. Expected: Judge-reported higher clarity ratings and faster comprehension times post-adaptation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If RLHF adaptation is unstable, fallback to rule-based customization of explanation templates based on static user profiles collected through questionnaires."

        "title": "Adaptive Multimodal Explanation System for Legal Judges Inspired by Clinical Decision Support and Human-Centered Design",
        "Problem_Statement": "Legal professionals, especially judges, encounter challenges understanding static, one-size-fits-all explanations from large language models (LLMs) used in legal document analysis. These explanations often lack personalization, interpretability, and modality diversity, resulting in limited trust and usability in critical decision-making workflows.",
        "Motivation": "While explanation systems for AI have advanced, the legal domain remains underserved by adaptive, user-centered methods that evolve dynamically according to stakeholder feedback. Despite the competitive landscape in Explainable AI (XAI), this research uniquely bridges legal AI with established clinical decision support paradigms, integrating human-centered design principles and multimodal data fusion approaches. By leveraging cross-domain insights from clinical AI systems known for their interpretability and trustworthiness, this work pushes beyond existing static or unidimensional approaches, proposing a robust framework for personalized, multimodal explanation adaptation that enhances both user trust and task effectiveness. This addresses the noted gap in stable, causally interpretable adaptation mechanisms and modality coordination for sensitive high-stakes environments.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel adaptive explanation system for legal judges that incorporates: (1) a quantitative feedback modeling framework in which judges' subjective inputs on clarity, relevance, and sufficiency are captured via structured, multimodal annotations combining Likert-scale ratings, clickstream analytics, and natural language comments; (2) a customized Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) mechanism augmented with causal inference techniques to disentangle and stabilize the impact of heterogeneous feedback on explanation generation policies, explicitly modeling user interaction history and uncertainty; (3) a multimodal explanation delivery module dynamically integrating textual summaries, visual aids (e.g., flowcharts), and semantic highlights, coordinated using a data fusion method inspired by clinical decision support systems to prevent modality conflicts and optimize interpretability within workflow constraints; (4) iterative co-design cycles with legal experts to refine interface usability and explanation modalities, leveraging human-centered design principles from clinical AI to enhance acceptance. The system employs Transformer-based architectures fine-tuned via this advanced RLHF setup, enabling real-time personalized adaptation of explanation granularity and modality blend based on stable feedback integration.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Conduct formative user studies with judges and legal experts to identify modality preferences and collect baseline explanation feedback using surveys and think-aloud protocols.\n2. Develop an interactive multimodal explanation interface incorporating textual, visual, and semantic highlighting components co-designed with domain experts.\n3. Implement a structured feedback collection system capturing quantitative ratings and interaction logs.\n4. Design and train RLHF models enhanced with causal inference algorithms to robustly integrate sparse and heterogeneous feedback for policy updates.\n5. Validate modality fusion strategies to ensure consistent, non-conflicting multimodal explanations.\n6. Evaluate system effectiveness via controlled user studies comparing static explanations, single-modality adaptive explanations, and the proposed multimodal adaptive system, measuring interpretability, trust, comprehension speed, and downstream task performance.\n7. Perform ablation studies isolating contributions of causal RLHF stabilization and multimodal fusion to interpretability and user satisfaction.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A legal brief summary generated by the LLM with initial multimodal explanation.\nFeedback: A judge annotates that the explanation is too technical, favors textual explanations, and finds some visual aids distracting.\nOutput: The system adapts by simplifying linguistic content, enhancing key reasoning steps in semantic highlights, and reducing visual complexity.\nExpected: Increased clarity ratings, reduced time to comprehend the brief, and improved trust metrics captured through questionnaires and interaction logs post-adaptation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should the causal RLHF mechanism prove too complex or unstable, the system will revert to a hybrid approach combining rule-based persona profiles with human-in-the-loop iterative tuning. This includes static user preference questionnaires informing multimodal explanation templates derived from established clinical decision support visual and textual standards, ensuring reliability and a baseline personalization level while maintaining coherence and usability in the legal context."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an ambitious adaptive explanation system using RLHF to tailor explanations for judges in real time. However, the mechanism by which the system reliably interprets heterogeneous judge feedback—often subjective and sparse—to update explanation policies dynamically is insufficiently detailed. Clarify how feedback on clarity, relevance, and sufficiency will be quantitatively modeled and integrated into the RLHF framework to ensure stable and causally interpretable adaptation. Further, expand on how multiple modalities (textual, visual, semantic highlights) will be coordinated and selected in adaptation to prevent inconsistent or confusing explanations for end users. Providing a preliminary technical sketch or referencing foundational RLHF methods adapted to this multi-modal, user-specific setting would substantiate the soundness of the mechanism assumption and guide implementation effectively. This clarity is crucial as the mechanism complexity strongly conditions feasibility and downstream impact effectiveness, especially in a sensitive field like legal decision support."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment indicating a highly competitive research field, the idea would notably benefit from integrating concepts from 'clinical decision support' and 'human-centered design' to broaden impact and reinforce methodological novelty. For instance, drawing parallels between legal and clinical domains could inspire more robust, interpretable user modeling strategies and evaluation protocols that emphasize trust and task effectiveness. Incorporating well-established human-centered design principles from clinical AI systems—such as iterative co-design with domain experts and multimodal explanation delivery optimized for professional workflows—can distinguish this work from existing XAI methods. Additionally, exploring multimodal data fusion techniques could enhance explanation richness and adaptivity, fostering a cross-domain framework transferable beyond legal judges. This cross-pollination will augment the research's relevance, robustness, and generalizability while addressing the competitive novelty constraints indicated by the pre-screening."
