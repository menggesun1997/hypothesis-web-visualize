    "title": "Ethical Conversational AI Framework for Healthcare Communications",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM-driven conversational AIs in healthcare suffer from ethical vulnerabilities such as linguistic biases, misinformation, and transparency issues, undermining trust and safety.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal critical gap of insufficient exploration into ethical, linguistic bias, and transparency issues in healthcare conversational AI by integrating critical language awareness and ethical AI principles into system design.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel framework combining critical discourse analysis techniques with an ethical AI auditing module embedded within LLMs. The framework will detect, flag, and adaptively mitigate biased or misleading outputs in real time. It incorporates transparency layers that explain AI reasoning in accessible language for clinicians and patients.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect healthcare conversational datasets annotated for bias and misinformation. 2. Integrate ethical auditing components with an open-source LLM fine-tuned on health dialogues. 3. Compare performance with baseline LLMs on bias and misinformation detection metrics. 4. Conduct user studies to assess transparency and trust improvements. Evaluation metrics include BLEU for language quality, bias detection F1 scores, and trustfulness surveys.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient asks, 'Is it safe to take my medication if I have a cold?' AI responds with clinically accurate and unbiased information, plus a transparency note explaining sources used. Output: 'Generally, it is safe to take your medication with a cold; however, always confirm with your healthcare provider. This advice is based on current clinical guidelines.'",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If the ethical auditing reduces response fluency, we will employ reinforcement learning from human feedback focusing on balancing accuracy and naturalness. Alternatively, we will modularize the auditing for after-output filtering rather than inline modulation."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan lacks detail on how the annotated datasets for bias and misinformation will be created or sourced, which is critical given the complexity of ethical annotations in healthcare dialogues. Furthermore, using BLEU as a metric for language quality, while common, may not sufficiently capture the nuanced improvements in ethical and transparent communication; consider including more specialized or human-centered evaluation metrics. Additionally, the plan does not address potential ethical concerns or privacy issues in collecting healthcare conversational data, which could impact feasibility. Clarifying these points would strengthen the practical viability and rigor of the experimental approach. Recommendations include detailing dataset annotation protocols, exploring complementary evaluation metrics focused on ethical language use and transparency, and specifying data governance measures to ensure compliance with healthcare privacy standards. This will ensure the experiments are credible and feasible in a sensitive application domain, such as healthcare conversational AI, where trust and safety are paramount.

          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty assessment places this work in a highly competitive area, a concrete way to enhance impact and novelty is to integrate clinical decision support (CDS) functionalities directly into the ethical conversational AI framework. Leveraging linked concepts such as 'clinical decision support', 'human-computer interaction', and 'licensed mental health clinicians', the framework could facilitate not only ethical dialogue but also provide actionable, context-aware recommendations to clinicians and patients within real-time conversations. This integration could improve clinical utility and adoption, differentiate the work from existing auditing or bias detection models, and align with current healthcare workflows. Furthermore, incorporating user-centered design principles from human-computer interaction would help tailor transparency layers and explanations to different user expertise levels (patients versus clinicians), potentially improving trust and usability. Such enhancements would broaden impact, boost originality, and increase adoption likelihood in practical healthcare settings. Target: Proposed_Method"
