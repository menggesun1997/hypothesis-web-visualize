        "title": "LegalXAI Evaluation Framework Integrating Biomedical Fairness Metrics",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current explainability evaluation frameworks for large language models (LLMs) in legal document analysis lack domain-specific rigor, leading to unreliable assessments of fairness, transparency, and accountability that are critical in high-stakes legal contexts.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical internal gap of insufficient domain-specific explainability evaluation frameworks by adapting rigorous biomedical AI fairness and evaluation methods via the 'national research evaluation system' and 'deployment of AI' hidden bridge. This cross-disciplinary synthesis is novel as it repurposes well-vetted clinical evaluation rigor into legal AI explainability.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid evaluation framework combining legal domain ontology, biomedical AI fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, calibration), and XAI assessment tools to systematically quantify LLM explanation quality, fairness, and stakeholder alignment. The method constructs mappings between legal concepts and clinical fairness constructs, integrating multi-dimensional explainability metrics tailored to legal tasks such as contract review, case summarization, and statute interpretation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate benchmark legal datasets (e.g., contracts, case law, statutes). 2. Train baseline LLMs fine-tuned for legal tasks. 3. Implement existing XAI methods to generate explanations. 4. Adapt biomedical fairness and evaluation metrics (e.g., subgroup fairness, calibration) to legal data. 5. Develop domain-specific explanation quality metrics (fidelity, plausibility) referencing legal expert annotations. 6. Quantitatively evaluate using cross-domain fairness metrics and legal expert user studies. 7. Compare against standard XAI evaluation baselines.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Contract clause specifying payment terms. Output: Explanation highlighting key phrases influencing model decision, evaluation scores for explanation fairness across contract types (e.g., commercial vs. consumer). Expected: Detailed explanation with fairness metrics confirming no systematic bias toward certain contract categories.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If biomedical fairness metrics poorly transfer, fallback to creating novel legal fairness metrics via expert elicitation and statistical analysis. Alternatively, focus on purely qualitative user studies to iteratively refine the evaluation framework."

        "title": "Adaptive User-Centered LLM Explanations for Judges via Human-in-the-Loop Feedback",
        "Problem_Statement": "Legal professionals such as judges face challenges interpreting static, one-size-fits-all explanations from LLMs, limiting trust and usability in legal document analysis workflows.",
        "Motivation": "This idea fills the external gap linking 'education' and 'field of XAI' by designing adaptive explanation systems that evolve with direct input from legal users, enabling personalized comprehensibility and fostering trust. The novelty lies in applying human-in-the-loop adaptation to generate stakeholder-specific, evolving explanations based on continuous feedback.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create an interactive explainability interface that incorporates user feedback from judges on explanation clarity, relevance, and sufficiency. Use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to adapt explanation generation policies, tuning explanation granularity and modality (e.g., textual, visual, semantic highlighting) dynamically per user profile and interaction history. The system learns to personalize explanations in real-time, improving interpretability and acceptance.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop prototype interactive explanation UI targeting judges. 2. Collect initial explanation examples from baseline LLM outputs with existing XAI techniques. 3. Recruit legal professionals for feedback sessions annotating explanation preferences. 4. Train RLHF models to optimize explanation generation guided by this feedback. 5. Evaluate improvements in interpretability, user trust, and task performance via controlled user studies comparing static vs. adaptive explanations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Legal brief summary generated by LLM with explanation. Judge provides feedback that explanations are too technical. Output: System generates simplified explanations emphasizing key reasoning steps. Expected: Judge-reported higher clarity ratings and faster comprehension times post-adaptation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If RLHF adaptation is unstable, fallback to rule-based customization of explanation templates based on static user profiles collected through questionnaires."

        "Proposed_Method": "Design a dual-layer explanation verification system: 1) LLM generates explanations with SHAP attributions highlighting feature importance in legal texts; 2) An intrusion-detection style module monitors explanation consistency, detecting anomalies or manipulations indicative of adversarial attacks or model drift. The system filters or flags suspicious explanations, integrating robustness guarantees with explainability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble legal datasets plus synthetically adversarial perturbations. 2. Train/fine-tune LLMs for legal reasoning. 3.

        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a web-based platform delivering tiered explanation tutorials with interactive modules, quizzes, and simulation exercises. Incorporate real-time assessment of learner cognitive load via behavioral metrics and adjust explanation complexity and modality dynamically. Embed legal LLM explanation examples to provide hands-on learning and iterative skill building.",
