The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI', 'abstract': 'In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'GPT-4 Technical Report', 'abstract': \"We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can\\naccept image and text inputs and produce text outputs.

With the technological development of deep learning-based high-precision recognition models and natural generation models, Metaverse is being strengthened with various factors, from mobile-based always-on access to connectivity with reality using virtual currency. The integration of enhanced social activities and neural-net methods requires a new definition of Metaverse suitable for the present, different from the previous Metaverse. This paper divides the concepts and essential techniques necessary for realizing the Metaverse into three components (i.e., hardware, software, and contents) and three approaches (i.e., user interaction, implementation, and application) rather than marketing or hardware approach to conduct a comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, we describe essential methods based on three components and techniques to Metaverse’s representative Ready Player One, Roblox, and Facebook research in the domain of films, games, and studies.

Recommender systems have proven to be a valuable way for online users to cope with the information overload and have become one of the most powerful and popular tools in electronic commerce. Correspondingly, various techniques for recommendation generation have been proposed. During the last decade, many of them have also been successfully deployed in commercial environments. Recommender Systems Handbook, an edited volume, is a multi-disciplinary effort that involves world-wide experts from diverse fields, such as artificial intelligence, human computer interaction, information technology, data mining, statistics, adaptive user interfaces, decision support systems, marketing, and consumer behavior. Theoreticiansand practitioners from these fields continually seek techniques for more efficient, cost-effective and accurate recommender systems. This handbook aims to impose a degree of order on this diversity, by presenting a coherent and unified repository of recommender systems’ major concepts, theories, methodologies, trends, challenges and applications. Extensive artificial applications, a variety of real-world applications, and detailed case studies are included. Recommender Systems Handbook illustrates how this technology can support the user in decision-making, planning and purchasing processes. It works for well known corporations such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and AT&T.

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method\\nstill requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of\\nthousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language\\ntask from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which\\ncurrent NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up\\nlanguage models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes\\neven reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning\\napproaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with\\n175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model,\\nand test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is\\napplied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot\\ndemonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3\\nachieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,\\nquestion-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require\\non-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a\\nnovel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time,\\nwe also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles,\\nas well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to\\ntraining on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples\\nof news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from\\narticles written by humans.

The recent success of commercial ML applications and the rapid growth of the field has created a high demand for off-the-shelf ML methods that can be used easily and without expert knowledge. However, many of the recent machine learning successes crucially rely on human experts, who manually select appropriate ML architectures (deep learning architectures or more traditional ML workflows) and their hyperparameters. To overcome this problem, the field of AutoML targets a progressive automation of machine learning, based on principles from optimization and machine learning itself.

In addition, many scientists also study citizen science as a research approach and as a way for science and society to interact and collaborate. This book provides a representation of the practices as well as scientific and societal outcomes in different disciplines.

The credible prospect of practical robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics as a modern scientific discipline. The ongoing vibrant expansion and strong growth of the field during the last decade has fueled this second edition of the Springer Handbook of Robotics. The first edition of the handbook soon became a landmark in robotics publishing and won the American Association of Publishers PROSE Award for Excellence in Physical Sciences & Mathematics as well as the organization’s Award for Engineering & Technology. The second edition of the handbook, edited by two internationally renowned scientists with the support of an outstanding team of seven part editors and more than 200 authors, continues to be an authoritative reference for robotics researchers, newcomers to the field, and scholars from related disciplines. The contents have been restructured to achieve four main objectives: the enlargement of foundational topics for robotics, the enlightenment of design of various types of robotic systems, the extension of the treatment on robots moving in the environment, and the enrichment of advanced robotics applications. Further to an extensive update, fifteen new chapters have been introduced on emerging topics, and a new generation of authors have joined the handbook’s team. A novel addition to the second edition is a comprehensive collection of multimedia references to more than 700 videos, which bring valuable insight into the contents.

A limiting factor for a broader adoption of AI technology is the inherent risks that come with giving up human control and oversight to “intelligent” machines. Forsensitive tasks involving critical infrastructures and affecting human well-being or health, it is crucial to limit the possibility of improper, non-robust and unsafe decisions and actions. Before deploying an AI system, we see a strong need to validate its behavior, and thus establish guarantees that it will continue to perform as expected when deployed in a real-world environment. In pursuit of that objective, ways for humans to verify the agreement between the AI decision structure and their own ground-truth knowledge have been explored. Explainable AI (XAI) has developed as a subfield of AI, focused on exposing complex AI models to humans in a systematic and interpretable manner. The 22 chapters included in this book provide a timely snapshot of algorithms, theory, and applications of interpretable and explainable AI and AI techniques that have been proposed recently reflecting the current discourse in this field and providing directions of future development. The book is organized in six parts: towards AI transparency; methods for interpreting AI systems; explaining the decisions of AI systems; evaluating interpretability and explanations; applications of explainable AI; and software for explainable AI.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "title": "Research Landscape Map on Utilizing Large Language Models for Bias Mitigation and Fairness in Social Media Text Analysis",
    "current_research_landscape": "This research cluster centers on developing and deploying large-scale multimodal and generative AI language models (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4) for high-level text analysis tasks, with an emphasis on human-level performance, explainability (XAI), and broad applicability across sectors such as information technology and digital transformation of organizations. Key foundational works highlight the transformative capabilities of generative conversational AI in producing sophisticated text outputs, the challenges of AI explainability for responsible use, and methods to improve model alignment to desired behaviors. The local concept network reveals four thematic islands: (1) multimodal model performance evaluated on academic benchmarks using text inputs and outputs; (2) generative, neural net methods and hardware approaches with major industrial applications (e.g., Facebook research); (3) digital transformation within the IT industry enabled by AI; and (4) implementation methods within the larger AI and XAI field. The concept 'neural net method' acts as a bridge connecting these thematic clusters, underscoring its foundational role in linking model capabilities, deployment contexts, and explainability paradigms. Dominant methodologies include large transformer-based language models, few-shot learning techniques, and explainability frameworks emphasizing transparency and ethical accountability. Overall, the central problem addressed is how to harness advanced LLMs for complex text analysis (especially social media) while tackling issues of bias, fairness, interpretability, and socially responsible deployment.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Foundational papers and local analyses identify critical limitations around AI biases rooted in training datasets and opaque decision-making processes. There is a need for improved transparency and interpretability of generative models to validate fairness—explicitly stated in XAI literature and ethical discussions on generative AI. Although models like GPT-4 show human-level performance, challenges remain in understanding and mitigating inherent biases and in assessing model outputs’ factual accuracy and social implications. The single bridge node 'neural net method' indicates limited integration between generative modeling approaches and digital transformation applications, suggesting a gap in translating technical model advances into organizational fairness practices.\n\nExternal/Novel Gaps: The global GPS analysis reveals underexplored intersections between multimodal generative models and domains such as forensic psychiatry, anomaly detection, emotion recognition, and healthcare (including nursing documentation). These cross-disciplinary bridges suggest opportunities to advance bias mitigation by incorporating domain-specific insights and multimodal data fusion techniques. For example, leveraging multimodal variational autoencoders and attention-based fusion methods from computer vision and biomedical AI could enrich social media text analysis with contextual, emotional, or visual cues to detect and correct bias more effectively. Similarly, industrial adoption literature on AI implementation and technology acceptance models highlights socio-technical factors absent from technical models, pointing to overlooked organizational and behavioral dimensions of fairness and AI uptake. Hence, integrating social science models on AI adoption with technical fairness methods remains an open frontier.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate multimodal variational autoencoder frameworks (identified in global bridges) with existing transformer-based generative models (local thematic island 1 & 2) to incorporate rich contextual signals (e.g., images, user metadata) into social media text analysis. This can address the internal gap of insufficient contextual awareness limiting bias mitigation in text-only models.\n\nOpportunity 2: Leverage explainable AI methodologies from the XAI field (local thematic island 4) coupled with socio-technical models of technology adoption and organizational transformation (from global GPS insights related to information technology industry and AI implementation) to develop transparent, accountable AI systems that foster fairness in social media analysis while ensuring societal acceptance and ethical deployment.\n\nOpportunity 3: Apply cross-domain concepts from healthcare AI and anomaly detection (highlighted in global hidden bridges) to design specialized bias detection and correction modules within large language models. This can tackle the challenge of recognizing subtle and emergent biases in dynamic social media streams by borrowing rigorous validation and interpretability techniques from clinical AI systems, thereby advancing the state of fairness in LLM-driven text analysis."
