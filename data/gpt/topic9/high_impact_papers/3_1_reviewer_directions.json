    "title": "Adaptive User-Centered LLM Explanations for Judges via Human-in-the-Loop Feedback",
    "Problem_Statement": "Legal professionals such as judges face challenges interpreting static, one-size-fits-all explanations from LLMs, limiting trust and usability in legal document analysis workflows.",
    "Motivation": "This idea fills the external gap linking 'education' and 'field of XAI' by designing adaptive explanation systems that evolve with direct input from legal users, enabling personalized comprehensibility and fostering trust. The novelty lies in applying human-in-the-loop adaptation to generate stakeholder-specific, evolving explanations based on continuous feedback.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an interactive explainability interface that incorporates user feedback from judges on explanation clarity, relevance, and sufficiency. Use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to adapt explanation generation policies, tuning explanation granularity and modality (e.g., textual, visual, semantic highlighting) dynamically per user profile and interaction history. The system learns to personalize explanations in real-time, improving interpretability and acceptance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop prototype interactive explanation UI targeting judges. 2. Collect initial explanation examples from baseline LLM outputs with existing XAI techniques. 3. Recruit legal professionals for feedback sessions annotating explanation preferences. 4. Train RLHF models to optimize explanation generation guided by this feedback. 5. Evaluate improvements in interpretability, user trust, and task performance via controlled user studies comparing static vs. adaptive explanations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Legal brief summary generated by LLM with explanation. Judge provides feedback that explanations are too technical. Output: System generates simplified explanations emphasizing key reasoning steps. Expected: Judge-reported higher clarity ratings and faster comprehension times post-adaptation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If RLHF adaptation is unstable, fallback to rule-based customization of explanation templates based on static user profiles collected through questionnaires."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an ambitious adaptive explanation system using RLHF to tailor explanations for judges in real time. However, the mechanism by which the system reliably interprets heterogeneous judge feedback—often subjective and sparse—to update explanation policies dynamically is insufficiently detailed. Clarify how feedback on clarity, relevance, and sufficiency will be quantitatively modeled and integrated into the RLHF framework to ensure stable and causally interpretable adaptation. Further, expand on how multiple modalities (textual, visual, semantic highlights) will be coordinated and selected in adaptation to prevent inconsistent or confusing explanations for end users. Providing a preliminary technical sketch or referencing foundational RLHF methods adapted to this multi-modal, user-specific setting would substantiate the soundness of the mechanism assumption and guide implementation effectively. This clarity is crucial as the mechanism complexity strongly conditions feasibility and downstream impact effectiveness, especially in a sensitive field like legal decision support."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment indicating a highly competitive research field, the idea would notably benefit from integrating concepts from 'clinical decision support' and 'human-centered design' to broaden impact and reinforce methodological novelty. For instance, drawing parallels between legal and clinical domains could inspire more robust, interpretable user modeling strategies and evaluation protocols that emphasize trust and task effectiveness. Incorporating well-established human-centered design principles from clinical AI systems—such as iterative co-design with domain experts and multimodal explanation delivery optimized for professional workflows—can distinguish this work from existing XAI methods. Additionally, exploring multimodal data fusion techniques could enhance explanation richness and adaptivity, fostering a cross-domain framework transferable beyond legal judges. This cross-pollination will augment the research's relevance, robustness, and generalizability while addressing the competitive novelty constraints indicated by the pre-screening."
