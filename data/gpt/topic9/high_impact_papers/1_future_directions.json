        "title": "Healthcare-Inspired Adaptive Tuning Framework for Low-Resource Languages",
        "Problem_Statement": "Parameter-efficient tuning of large language models for low-resource languages suffers from inefficiencies and lack of systematic deployment strategies, limiting practical usability in real-world settings.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the internal gap of parameter-efficient tuning (delta-tuning) in multilingual contexts by integrating healthcare implementation science frameworks (e.g., Quality Implementation Framework) promises systematic, accountable model adaptation and deployment strategies, a niche currently unexplored.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a novel adaptive tuning framework embedding the steps and quality assurance metrics from healthcare implementation science into delta-tuning processes. This includes meta-planning phases, continuous monitoring, feedback loops, and stakeholder involvement stages translated into DL model-finetuning protocols. Implementation integrates these stages with scalable cloud infrastructure to enable transparent parameter-efficient tuning customized per language domain.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select benchmark low-resource language datasets (e.g., Masakhane datasets). 2. Implement baseline delta-tuning methods using pretrained LLMs like mT5 or mBERT. 3. Embed Quality Implementation Framework stages into training loop controlling hyperparameters, monitoring adaptation metrics, and audit logging. 4. Evaluate performance on standard NLP tasks (NER, POS, MT), analyze tuning efficiency, and conduct qualitative interpretability assessments. 5. Compare deployment reproducibility and accountability against baselines.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A Swahili sentence for NER task. Expected Output: Entities correctly recognized with model parameters selectively adapted using the adaptive framework, with interpretability reports showing tuning rationale and deployment steps logged for accountability.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct embedding of QoI frameworks into tuning disrupts optimization, alternate strategy is to decouple implementation science as a meta-layer for model monitoring and post-hoc auditing instead of within-loop adaptation controls."

Build prototype integrating speech-to-text, gesture sensors, and LLM for response generation. 3. Design active learning protocol with user feedback incorporated into model fine-tuning. 4. Compare against static text-only fine-tuning baselines on downstream tasks. 5. Measure improvements in accuracy, user satisfaction, and contextual grounding.",

The platform interprets multimodal input and generates contextually accurate answers. Expected output includes correct language understanding augmented by gesture context leading to improved NLP task accuracy.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal hardware integration is infeasible, fallback to simulated gesture/text interaction via synthetic data and user crowdsourcing to approximate multimodal feedback."

The pipeline automates data ingestion, model tuning with delta strategies, and deliver human-understandable explanations alongside predictions.",
