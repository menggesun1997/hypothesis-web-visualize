    "title": "Cloud-Native Explainable AI Pipelines for Low-Resource Language LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of scalable, transparent AI pipelines hampers deployment of large language models for low-resource languages, impacting interpretability and trustworthiness in practical applications.",
    "Motivation": "Leveraging Google Cloud Platform's cloud-based workflows combined with generative model advances to build explainable AI pipelines directly addresses critical gaps in interpretability and scalability, a neglected yet necessary integration highlighted in the landscape map.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Engineer a modular cloud-native pipeline using GCP components (AI Platform, Dataflow, BigQuery) wrapping large language model training, fine-tuning, and inference with integrated explainability modules (e.g., LIME, SHAP adapted for multilingual contexts). The pipeline automates data ingestion, model tuning with delta strategies, and deliver human-understandable explanations alongside predictions.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Deploy pipeline on GCP for selected low-resource languages. 2. Use datasets like FLORES and Masakhane. 3. Implement baseline model training and delta-tuning modules. 4. Integrate explainability tools adapted for multilingual text. 5. Evaluate model accuracy, explanation fidelity, and pipeline scalability across different NLP tasks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A low-resource language sentence classified by the model. Output: Prediction + an explanation highlighting text tokens influencing the decision, visualized via cloud dashboard, accessible to non-technical stakeholders.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If explainability modules have poor fidelity on low-resource languages, fallback to simple attention visualization and feature importance methods, or develop language-agnostic surrogate models for explanations."

          "feedback_content": "The description of the Proposed_Method lacks clarity on how the explainability tools like LIME and SHAP will be specifically adapted to the multilingual and low-resource settings. There is a critical need to detail how these tools, originally designed for high-resource contexts, can maintain explanation fidelity and relevance under low-resource linguistic constraints. Providing a more concrete technical mechanism or algorithmic adaptation plan would strengthen confidence in the approach's soundness and novelty within the competitive space. Consider elaborating on possible architectural modifications or new interpretability techniques tailored for low-resource language embeddings and models where traditional feature importance methods struggle due to data sparsity and language diversity constraints, ensuring that the pipeline truly delivers meaningful interpretability outputs rather than generic or misleading explanations. This would also clarify how the pipeline advances beyond existing explainability pipelines in high-resource languages, addressing assumptions about tool transferability and interpretability quality that currently remain implicit or underdeveloped in the proposal's method section. Targeting this gap will improve the work's conceptual clarity and technical depth considerably, enabling a stronger review outcome and eventual impactful deployment outcomes for trustworthiness in low-resource LLM applications. This is vital given the identified competitive novelty realm and the proposal’s core promise around explainability innovation in this domain, which is a key differentiator relative to existing pipelines on GCP or similar cloud environments. The authors should revise the Proposed_Method to explicitly describe these adaptations and their justification, potentially with illustrative preliminary results or algorithm sketches if available, before or alongside the main experiments. The current method phrasing risks being perceived as a straightforward engineering integration rather than a novel research contribution on explainability advancements for low-resource languages, which is critical for an impactful venue like ACL or NeurIPS."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines reasonable high-level stages but lacks key practical details which are essential to assess feasibility. For example, the plan does not specify how pipeline scalability will be quantitatively measured in the cloud environment, nor how multilingual adaptation of explainability tools will be validated rigorously. Incorporation of robust evaluation metrics for explanation fidelity beyond accuracy (e.g., comprehensibility to human evaluators, faithfulness, robustness under noisy input) is necessary to demonstrate the pipeline’s practical utility and scientific rigor. Additionally, more concrete timelines, resource estimation (e.g., compute cost on GCP), and fallback iteration cycles if early results show low fidelity would improve the feasibility assessment. The plan should detail how training and tuning efficiency improvements are measured and compared against baselines, as these directly affect scalable deployment claims. Finally, some consideration of ethical concerns or stakeholder feedback loops for the explainability outputs would increase confidence in the pipeline’s real-world applicability and user trustworthiness. Clarifying these elements will enable reviewers and potential adopters to understand the project's realistic implementation scope and expected scientific outcomes, supporting stronger, actionable conclusions on feasibility and relevance."
