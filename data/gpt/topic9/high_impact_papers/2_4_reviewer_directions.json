    "title": "Cross-disciplinary LLM Trainer Incorporating Health Informatics and Critical Discourse Analysis",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM training in healthcare conversational AI lacks cross-disciplinary incorporation of health informatics standards and critical language awareness insights, resulting in models that underperform in realistic clinical settings and communication transparency.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal and external gaps regarding the disconnect between discourse analysis, health information systems, and LLM practical implementation by creating a novel training paradigm embedding standards across domains to enhance model utility and safety.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a multi-objective fine-tuning pipeline for LLMs combining loss functions reflecting linguistic transparency (from discourse analysis), EHR data schema constraints (from health informatics), and clinical correctness. Introduces differentially weighted data blending and continuous integration of ethical auditing.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Aggregate diverse datasets spanning clinical notes, clinician-patient transcripts, and health IT documentation. 2. Define and implement multi-objective loss functions and incorporate ethical auditing modules. 3. Fine-tune LLMs using this novel paradigm and benchmark on clinical QA, communication assessment, and documentation accuracy tasks. 4. Conduct user studies with healthcare professionals for qualitative evaluation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Query about medication side effects phrased ambiguously. Output: AI responds with clear, unbiased information structured consistent with health IT documentation and critical clarity standards.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-objective training leads to convergence issues, perform sequential training phases focusing on critical discourse then health informatics separately, followed by ensemble approaches."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan is ambitious but lacks sufficient detail on feasibility aspects, particularly regarding data aggregation and ethical auditing integration. Aggregating diverse datasets spanning clinical notes, clinician-patient transcripts, and health IT documentation involves significant challenges related to data privacy, heterogeneity, and standardization, which should be explicitly addressed with mitigation strategies. Furthermore, the plan could benefit from more concrete milestones for validating multi-objective loss functions and convergence criteria to ensure training stability. Clarifying these feasibility issues will strengthen the experimental approach's viability and reduce risks related to implementation complexity and ethical concerns, which is critical given the domain's sensitivity and regulatory environment. Consider elaborating on data governance, how ethical auditing modules will be constructed and triggered during training, and practical measures to monitor and handle convergence issues, possibly including concrete metrics or early stopping criteria tailored to multi-objective optimization scenarios within clinical contexts.  This would make the experiment more scientifically rigorous and practically executable in realistic clinical AI settings.  Target section: Experiment_Plan."

          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty is rated as NOV-COMPETITIVE due to strong existing links between health informatics, discourse analysis, and LLM training, integrating concepts from the globally-linked areas could boost impact and distinctiveness. Specifically, leveraging federated learning can address privacy challenges inherent in clinical data aggregation by enabling decentralized, collaborative training across multiple healthcare institutions without sharing raw data. Additionally, incorporating digital health competencies frameworks could guide the ethical auditing modules to evaluate model outputs not only for linguistic transparency but also for clinical safety and user digital literacy. Including an element of automatic text summarization or conversational agent optimization focused on suicide prevention or digital health scenarios could further specialize the model for high-impact, targeted healthcare conversational tasks. By integrating federated learning and digital health competency frameworks, the project can simultaneously enhance model robustness, ethical safeguards, and practical utility in sensitive clinical contexts, thus distinguishing the work in this crowded research landscape.
