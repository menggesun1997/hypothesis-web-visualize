    "title": "Explainability-Driven Legal Document Summarization with Emphasis on Ethical and Governance Constraints",
    "Problem_Statement": "Legal document summarization by LLMs lacks transparent explanation for content selection and potential bias, risking ethical and governance failures in legal AI deployment.",
    "Motivation": "Building on internal gaps around ethics and deployment and external opportunities linking ethics with national research evaluation, this idea uniquely entwines explainability mechanisms within summarization to reveal rationale and compliance with governance principles, a paradigm shift from pure generation to accountable summarization.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid summarization framework embedding transparent sub-module explanations that trace sentence or clause contribution to summary. Integrate ethical constraint verification modules enforcing fairness, privacy, and bias mitigation policies. Use attention visualization and counterfactual analysis to elucidate governance compliance within generated summaries.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Fine-tune summarization LLMs on legal corpora with ethical annotation. 2. Implement explanation extraction layers (attention, gradient-based, counterfactual). 3. Encode governance policies as logical constraints integrated during generation. 4. Evaluate summary quality, explanation fidelity, and ethical compliance via expert review and automated metrics. 5. Iterate models to optimize tradeoffs.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Court opinion requiring summary. Output: Summary with traceable explanation of key points chosen and flagged potential ethical concerns (e.g., bias, privacy exposure). Expected: Higher trust and auditability in summary use.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If explicit ethical constraint integration limits summary quality, fallback to post-hoc ethical explanation layers highlighting risks and allowing human override."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a hybrid framework with explanation extraction (attention, gradients, counterfactuals) and governance constraint enforcement, but it lacks a clear and concrete specification of how these modules interact during the generation process. For example, how are logical governance constraints integrated into the generation model operationally? Are these soft constraints guiding model outputs, or hard constraints enforcing filtering? Clarifying the internal workflow, data flows between sub-modules, and exact algorithmic steps is essential to assess soundness and reproducibility reliably. Providing a detailed architecture diagram or pseudocode would strengthen the proposal's clarity and mechanistic validity considerably, reducing ambiguity about integration and compliance assurance steps within the LLM summarization framework. Without this, the core mechanism remains vague and could face substantial implementation challenges or misalignments with the stated ethical goals. Address this gap by specifying the interfacing and decision logic of these hybrid modules explicitly, including how explanation feedback influences summary materialization and ethical compliance verification in a unified pipeline or iterative manner, if applicable.  This will help verify assumptions and facilitate sound scientific development and review of the proposed system's principle working principles and technical feasibility from a mechanistic angle.

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is generally well-structured but misses critical details impacting feasibility and reproducibility: (1) Availability and scope of the 'ethical annotation' in legal corpora are unclearâ€”given the specialized nature and sensitivity of legal documents, sourcing or creating such annotated data is nontrivial and needs elaboration. (2) The plan does not describe strategies or metrics for quantitatively measuring 'explanation fidelity' and 'ethical compliance.' Relying mostly on expert review without automated, objective metrics could hinder scalability and empirical rigor. (3) The integration of logical governance policies during generation is ambitious; the experiment plan should outline fallback protocols or prototype stages to handle potential failures in constraint enforcement gracefully. (4) Additionally, there's no mention of baseline or ablation studies to validate component contributions or tradeoffs mentioned in iteration steps. To improve feasibility, specify data acquisition or synthetic augmentation methods for ethical annotations, define or cite precise evaluation metrics (e.g., faithfulness scores, bias quantification metrics), and propose incremental evaluation steps with fallback or human-in-the-loop components.
