        "title": "Multimodal Contextualization with Variational Autoencoders for Bias Identification",
        "Problem_Statement": "Bias in social media text analysis persists due to limited contextual understanding in text-only LLMs, which hampers effective bias mitigation and fairness assessment.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient contextual awareness limiting bias mitigation, by integrating multimodal data (images, metadata) using variational autoencoder frameworks, a high-potential innovation pathway identified in the research landscape map.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel architecture combining transformer-based LLMs with multimodal variational autoencoders that encode images and user metadata jointly with text. The system learns contextualized latent representations to detect and mitigate bias signals not evident in text alone. Attention-based fusion modules integrate these modalities dynamically during analysis, enabling richer context-aware debiasing.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect social media datasets with aligned text, images, and metadata (e.g., Twitter with images and user info). 2) Train a multimodal VAE jointly with a pretrained LLM fine-tuned on social bias identification. 3) Evaluate bias detection and mitigation on standard fairness benchmarks and customized multimodal bias test sets. 4) Compare against text-only baseline LLMs and analyze improvements in bias scores and fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equal opportunity).",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A social media post with a female user's image and text praising a traditionally male profession. Output: Bias detection module flags potential gender stereotype; debiased text analysis reduces stereotypical bias score, enhancing fairness evaluation accuracy.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal fusion shows limited benefit, conduct ablation studies to isolate modality contributions. Explore augmenting single-modality models with synthetic contextual signals or incorporate domain-adaptive pretraining to strengthen context understanding."

        "title": "Explainable Socio-Technical Fairness Framework (ESTFF) for Social Media LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing fairness solutions for social media text analysis lack transparency and fail to incorporate socio-technical factors critical for real-world adoption and ethical deployment.",
        "Motivation": "Directly addresses the gap connecting XAI methods with socio-technical adoption models, promoting transparent and accountable AI systems that consider organizational and societal acceptance—a novel integration opportunity.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop ESTFF, a layered framework combining state-of-the-art XAI techniques (e.g., SHAP, counterfactual explanations) with socio-technical modeling (technology acceptance models, organizational behavior theories). The framework generates interpretable fairness assessments and user-centric explanations tailored to stakeholder roles (users, moderators, organizations), facilitating transparent decision-making and trustworthy AI use in social media analysis.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble social media text datasets with fairness annotations. 2) Implement LLM-based bias detection models augmented with XAI explanation modules. 3) Survey organizational stakeholders to identify decision factors for AI adoption. 4) Integrate user feedback through interactive explanation interfaces. 5) Evaluate framework effectiveness using fairness metrics, explanation quality measures, and user trust/acceptance surveys.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Automated bias detection on political posts with controversial language. Output: ESTFF provides explanation highlighting bias features, links these to socio-technical concerns (e.g., potential censorship risk), and adjusts recommendations considering organizational policies to maximize ethical deployment acceptance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If stakeholder integration proves complex, prototype modular interfaces focusing first on technical explainability, then incrementally incorporate socio-technical features. Use simulations or synthetic feedback to iterate design before full deployment."

        "Motivation": "Leverages hidden bridges with healthcare AI and anomaly detection to design rigorous bias detection/correction modules within LLMs—novel cross-domain transfer to advance bias recognition capabilities for social media analysis.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a hybrid LLM framework embedding specialized anomaly detection algorithms inspired by clinical AI systems. Utilize statistical and machine learning-based outlier detection on LLM output patterns, combined with domain knowledge from healthcare bias diagnostics to flag anomalous social media text indicative of emerging biases. Integrate a corrective feedback loop to retrain LLM components dynamically.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compile real-time social media streams with annotated emergent bias events. 2) Implement anomaly detection techniques inspired by healthcare AI literature (e.g., temporal pattern analysis, feature outlier models). 3) Embed modules into LLM pipelines for bias flagging and correction. 4) Evaluate detection accuracy, false positives, and adaptability over time with emerging bias scenarios.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sudden increase of xenophobic slurs in posts after geopolitical events. Output: Anomaly detection flags unusual pattern shifts, bias detection module raises alerts with explanations, triggering automated mitigation measures.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If anomaly detection integration impedes performance, explore lightweight ensemble approaches combining static bias classifiers with anomaly scoring. Alternatively, simulate surrogate anomaly data to tune detection sensitivity before full deployment."

The model continuously learns personalized bias patterns and adaptively tunes mitigation parameters during inference, improving fairness evaluations tailored to evolving social contexts.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather large social media datasets with user metadata, text, and images. 2) Pretrain multimodal transformer with attention fusion modules. 3) Fine-tune for bias detection with adaptive calibration layers. 4) Perform longitudinal studies tracking bias calibration effectiveness over time and varied user groups. Compare with static mitigation baselines using fairness and personalization metrics.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Posts from diverse demographic groups with identical textual content but varying images and metadata. Output: System identifies differential bias risks and adjusts mitigation strategies, producing fairness-aware analyses sensitive to personalized social contexts.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If attention-based fusion complexity limits scalability, experiment with simpler gated fusion mechanisms or incorporate dimensionality reduction on metadata embeddings to balance computational cost and performance."
