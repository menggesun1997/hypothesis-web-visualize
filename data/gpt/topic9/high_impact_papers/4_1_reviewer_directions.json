          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method would benefit from a clearer mechanistic description detailing how knowledge distillation and hardware-aware NAS are integrated within a unified pipeline. Specifically, more explanation is needed on the interaction between hardware profiling data and the NAS search process, how distillation loss informs architecture search, and how this dynamic adaptivity is operationalized. This clarity is crucial given the complexity and potential instability noted in the fallback plan, and it will substantially strengthen the internal validity and reproducibility of the approach. Providing a conceptual diagram or pseudocode could also help reviewers and future users understand the framework's operation and innovation boundaries more precisely and thus improve soundness and trustworthiness of the methodology sections of the submission. The current description hints at innovation but lacks sufficient detail to fully assess the execution feasibility and soundness of the joint optimization mechanism proposed, especially under edge device constraints and multi-objective trade-offs relevant to latency, accuracy, and energy consumption metrics. Therefore, clarifying the integrated mechanism in Proposed_Method is the top priority for advancing this work toward maturity and acceptance for a premier conference audience, addressing potential critical weaknesses in conceptualization and communication of the novel joint optimization strategy at the heart of the idea's novelty and impact claims, which remain partly speculative in its current form due to these gaps in exposition and logical grounding in the proposal text provided here. Targeted elaboration here supports the underdeveloped pipeline innovation argument and shores up the building block of subsequent experimental validation and downstream impact demonstration strategies detailed later in the proposal. Establishing confidence around the joint optimization backbone qualifies as the first critical step in strengthening overall internal soundness and thus the probability of robust, convincing, and insightful empirical results to follow from the stepwise experimental plan outlined in the proposal. This must come before moving to broader impact or integration enhancements to maximize the cohesion and credibility of the contribution well tailored to the top-tier review horizon expected by NeurIPS/ACL area chairs and reviewers with diverse expertise in model compression, NAS, and hardware-aware ML systems design co-optimization fields. Lastly, this detail will also help assess tradeoffs and limitations candidly, supporting transparent discussion of risks and fallback procedures as well as clarify the method’s domain of effective applicability, thus lowering the risk of overly optimistic or vague claims under the hood, a recurring pitfall in joint optimization papers currently in this high-competition area of edge-intelligence deployment research. This feeds back into better shaped experiment design and more authoritative impact statements downstream too, so the chain of logic from sound methodology to feasible evaluation to meaningful impact is fully supported and traceable for conference reviewers and future users alike, ensuring the proposal meets the high standards expected at premier venues and is valued as a credible, concrete advance in the state-of-the-art rather than an aspirational, but poorly grounded concept with uncertain implementation potential and reproducibility challenges, which often limits acceptance and the project's ultimate influence and adoption outside the authors' immediate research circle. By focusing feedback here first, you enable the strongest possible foundation for all other parts of the proposal's quality spectrum, making this an essential primary target of revision and elaboration before proceeding further, thus empowering subsequent improvements on impact scope and novelty integration refinements enabled by clearly delineated and richly documented core methodology mechanics as the intellectual kernel of this contribution’s supposed value proposition and competitive edge in a crowded and fast-moving research frontier. In sum, strengthening the mechanistic clarity and tangible execution blueprint of the Proposed_Method offers the highest leverage on the overall soundness and feasibility of the submission—pump-priming its acceptance potential at leading peer venues through robust foundational rigor and trustworthiness that reviewers strongly prize and critically weigh during evaluations of technically ambitious integrated optimization frameworks coupling NAS and distillation for hardware-aware edge LLM deployment scenarios as posited here. This effort will not only boost reviewers' confidence in the approach but also significantly enhance the quality and clarity of subsequent analysis sections, delivering a cohesive, well-articulated, and impactful contribution aligned with premier conference expectations and standards for top-tier AI research innovation targeting heterogeneous IoT and edge device ecosystems with next-generation compressed LLM solutions tailored dynamically by unified NAS-distillation strategies informed by measured hardware profiles and multi-objective resource-quality balancing criteria centrally advanced in the core proposal design objectives and tactics outlined above but presently needing crystallization and explicit definition in the available exposition related to the Proposed_Method section to fulfill its promised potential fully and convincingly as a novel yet feasible and implementable research contribution to the literature and the community's practical toolkit for edge intelligence model design and optimization challenges increasingly prominent and impactful across many application domains and industry segments globally in the recent AI era. The Innovator must address this gap immediately with comprehensive detail, clarity, and formalization before proceeding to broader impact enhancements or experimentation plan elaborations to maximize total perceived value, scholarly contribution, and adoption likelihood at top-tier venues focused on the confluence of deep learning, NAS, distillation, and hardware-aware AI design and deployment optimization problems at scale in real-world heterogeneous edge device environments accommodating large language model inference workloads effectively under stringent resource constraints and performance quality specifications inherent in these emerging intelligent computing paradigms now gaining substantial importance and attention worldwide within the research and industrial AI communities alike, marking the submission as a leading-edge yet grounded and demonstrably valid contribution poised for rapid adoption and influence on subsequent research and product innovation pipelines, given the high-quality foundation and clear operational principles the authors are expected to supply by resolving this critical critique on the Proposed_Method mechanism without delay or equivocation, thereby building the primary substantial technical core that supports the entire research narrative and feasibility proof journey mapped subsequently in the stepwise experimental plan and impact test case illustrations also presented for scrutiny and reproduction at scale by practitioners on diverse edge hardware platforms in the targeted application domain scenarios detailed within the submission materials accompanying this review request."

          "feedback_content": "Given the score of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the globally linked concepts provided, I suggest enhancing the proposal's novelty and impact by explicitly incorporating and jointly optimizing the software-hardware co-design aspect through methods like edge-cloud collaborative computing and on-device learning. Leveraging concepts such as distributed training and AI edge devices with lightweight convolutional neural networks or graph neural networks could broaden the framework's applicability beyond LLMs toward more diverse model classes and tasks. Integrating techniques from multimodal learning or generative AI, such as generative adversarial networks for model compression or variational autoencoders for surrogate modeling to accelerate NAS, could further improve search efficiency and model fidelity under hardware constraints. This would fill opportunity gaps and distinctively position the framework in a rapidly evolving edge intelligence ecosystem by coupling NAS and distillation with adaptive learning strategies and collaborative infrastructures. Explicitly articulating these integrations and how they influence objective formulation, hardware profiling, and dynamic adaptation mechanisms will help elevate both the novelty and impact, making the framework more versatile and attractive to a broader audience in AIoT, edge-cloud computing, and intelligent data analysis communities, thus addressing the competitive novelty concerns while significantly amplifying potential for real-world deployment success and cross-domain synergy. This suggestion aligns well with the motivation to bridge siloed innovation by moving from a combined but somewhat narrow focus on LLM compression to a systemic, holistic co-design paradigm enabling sustainable, scalable deployment of deep neural networks across heterogeneous edge and collaborative cloud-edge environments, encompassing a richer palette of model architectures, learning methods, and application domains."
