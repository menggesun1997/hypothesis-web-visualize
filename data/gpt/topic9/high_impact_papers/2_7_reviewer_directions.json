    "title": "Hybrid Rule-LLM System for Ethical Dialogue Management in Healthcare Conversational AI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Pure LLM-based conversational agents risk generating unethical or biased content without real-time corrective mechanisms tailored for healthcare dialogs.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap concerning ethics and transparency by creating a hybrid system where symbolic rule-based ethical constraints guide and correct LLM-generated conversational responses dynamically.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a dialogue management pipeline where the LLM proposes responses and a symbolic ethical reasoner verifies and modifies outputs based on a formalized healthcare ethics knowledge base and critical language norms before user delivery.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop or adopt a healthcare ethical ontology encoding core values and norms. 2. Implement the symbolic reasoner integrated with an open-domain LLM. 3. Test on datasets with known ethical challenge cases in healthcare dialogs. 4. Evaluate success by measuring decreases in flagged unethical or biased outputs.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient asks about off-label drug use. The LLM replies with cautious medical advice. The ethical reasoner adds disclaimers and modifies any inappropriate claims before output.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If symbolic reasoner delays response excessively, apply real-time ethical monitoring post-generation with automatic rollback mechanisms. Utilize simpler rule sets for critical areas only."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes a symbolic ethical reasoner that modifies or verifies LLM outputs using a healthcare ethics knowledge base. However, the mechanism lacks clarity on how conflicts between the LLM's probabilistic outputs and the symbolic rules are resolved in real time. Furthermore, the integration pipeline and its latency management are not detailed, which is critical for interactive dialogue in healthcare. The proposal should concretely specify the interaction protocol between the LLM and the ethical reasoner, including handling ambiguity and reasoning explainability to users, to strengthen soundness and trustworthiness of the system behavior in sensitive healthcare contexts. Clarifying these aspects will better demonstrate the method's robustness and rationale under diverse, possibly conflicting inputs from patients and providers, enabling an effective dynamic correction setup rather than a simple post-hoc filter or overlay."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty rating as NOV-COMPETITIVE in a crowded convergence space of ethical AI and conversational systems, the idea could substantially improve impact and distinctiveness by incorporating concepts from the linked 'multi-agent systems' and 'knowledge management'. For example, structuring the ethical reasoner as a specialized agent within a multi-agent dialogue ecosystem could enable modular, scalable ethical monitoring and dynamic knowledge sharing across agents in complex healthcare scenarios. Leveraging advanced knowledge management techniques to maintain, update, and audit the ethical ontology and reasoning logs could enhance transparency and adaptability over time. Embedding these globally referenced concepts promises to elevate the system beyond static hybrid pipelines into a more generalizable, robust architecture fostering continual learning, ethical governance, and interoperability in healthcare conversational AI."
