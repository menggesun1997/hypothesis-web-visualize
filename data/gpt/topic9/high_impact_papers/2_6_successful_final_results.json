        "title": "Clinically Validated Explainable Conversational AI with Integrated Adoption Modeling for Healthcare Providers",
        "Problem_Statement": "Healthcare providers frequently distrust LLM-powered conversational AI tools due to a lack of transparent, faithful, and clinically relevant explanations behind AI recommendations, hindering trust and adoption. Existing explanation techniques like attention visualization often do not reliably reflect the AI's true reasoning, raising concerns about explanation validity and safety in critical healthcare decision-making contexts.",
        "Motivation": "This research addresses the pressing need for trustworthy AI in healthcare by advancing explainability methods that are rigorously validated for clinical relevance and fidelity. Furthermore, it integrates socio-technical adoption frameworks, such as the extended UTAUT model, to systematically assess and optimize healthcare providers' behavioral intention and acceptance of explainable AI tools. By combining state-of-the-art interpretability approaches tailored to clinical evidence standards with comprehensive human factors evaluation, the work aims to create a transformative, ethically grounded conversational AI system that fosters genuine trust and sustainable adoption among diverse healthcare professionals.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-faceted approach combining: (1) development of clinically grounded explainability modules that fuse LLM internals interpretation (e.g., concept attribution, attention visualization) with formal explanation validity metrics and iterative clinical expert annotations to ensure faithfulness and clinical alignment; (2) incorporation of domain adaptation methods including social actor representation and virtual patient care scenarios to contextualize explanations to diverse clinical workflows and specialties; and (3) embedding extended UTAUT-based behavioral intention modeling within user studies to quantitatively measure factors such as social influence, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and perceived risk impacting AI adoption. This socio-technical framework will leverage covariance-based structural equation modeling to analyze complex relationships influencing trust and usage intentions, enhancing novelty by bridging AI interpretability advances with rigorous healthcare technology acceptance research.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collaborate with a multidisciplinary clinical advisory board to iteratively develop and validate explanation algorithms, ensuring faithfulness using explanation fidelity metrics and expert annotations comparing AI explanations against established clinical guidelines. 2. Design and implement explanation interfaces incorporating layered explanations: linguistic influences, clinical evidence, uncertainty, and simulated social scenarios tailored to user's specialty. 3. Recruit a diverse cohort of 60+ healthcare providers across specialties and experience levels, ensuring demographic and role representation. 4. Conduct controlled user studies with randomized groups receiving either full explainability interface or baseline AI outputs without explanations, ensuring ethical approvals and data privacy compliance. 5. Utilize standardized, validated questionnaires adapted from the extended UTAUT model (covering constructs like behavioral intention, social influence, perceived risk) alongside qualitative interviews to assess interpretability, trust, and adoption intention. 6. Analyze quantitative data employing covariance-based structural equation modeling to identify key factors influencing acceptance. 7. Refine the system iteratively based on findings, and evaluate longitudinal adoption impact. 8. Prepare fallback strategies including streamlined explanation variants (e.g., focused clinical guideline summaries with confidence intervals) configurable by users to maintain responsiveness and usability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: AI recommends a diabetes treatment adjustment. Explanation panel dynamically presents (a) highlighted clinical text influences with provenance, (b) citations of relevant ADA guidelines, (c) quantified uncertainty scores, and (d) virtual patient social context illustrating treatment adherence scenarios. User receives tailored explanations influenced by their specialty (endocrinology vs. primary care) and role (physician vs. nurse practitioner). Example 2: Behavioral intention metrics reveal perceived risk reduction correlates with exposure to validated explanations intertwined with social actor scenarios, empirically demonstrating improved trust and adoption propensity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If computational constraints or low explanation fidelity arise, we will default to delivering curated summaries of key clinical guideline citations paired with confidence intervals, omitting complex attention visualizations. User interface will offer toggles for explanation detail to accommodate diverse user preferences and minimize cognitive overload. These fallback explanations will continue to be validated with clinicians and integrated into behavioral intention assessments to ensure meaningful trust-building despite reduced explanation complexity."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The foundational assumption that attention visualization and concept attribution from LLM internals can be directly and reliably interpreted as explanations by healthcare providers requires more robust justification. Given known issues with attention as an explanation and the clinical sensitivity of AI recommendations, the proposal should clarify how it will validate the faithfulness and clinical relevance of such explanations to build genuine trust rather than just perceived transparency. Without this, the method risks producing misleading or superficial explanations that do not align with clinician decision needs or standards of care documentation, undermining soundness and user confidence in the system's outputs. Consider integrating formal explanation validity metrics or clinical expert iterative validation earlier in the method design phase to solidify this assumption's foundation and mitigate risks of misinterpretation or over-reliance on known-to-be-imperfect proxy explanation methods within LLMs in healthcare contexts, thereby ensuring methodological soundness and practical trustworthiness of the AI explanations provided to healthcare users in the deployment phase. This point targets the core Proposed_Method and Problem_Statement assumptions about explanation extraction and trust generation via the chosen techniques, which are critical to overall system reliability and acceptance by healthcare providers. Â In summary, please clarify and empirically justify that the proposed explanation methods will yield valid and clinically meaningful insights rather than superficial or potentially misleading rationales that could deteriorate trust or safety in critical healthcare usage contexts, possibly referencing or adapting state-of-the-art interpretability approaches tailored specifically for healthcare LLM applications with verifiable clinical grounding and use case alignment (e.g., incorporating domain expert annotation or comparison to evidence-based clinical guidelines). Such clarifications would improve the conceptual and empirical soundness of the foundational assumptions underpinning the research idea and prevent overestimating explanation efficacy from LLM internals alone in sensitive healthcare environments, overall strengthening the scientific rigor of the approach before empirical trials with clinicians are conducted. Â Additionally, addressing this uncertainty can better inform downstream experiment design and interpretation of user trust evaluations in the planned studies, especially since explanation fidelity is crucial for effective clinician-AI collaboration and adoption in medical decision support, which is central to the paper's motivation and impact claims."

For feasibility and reproducibility, the proposal should explicitly define evaluation protocols, such as standardized questionnaires for perceived usefulness (e.g., based on extended UTAUT model constructs like performance expectancy and effort expectancy), statistical methods for analyzing user trust changes, and control conditions (e.g., standard AI outputs without explanations). Furthermore, considering the competitive and interdisciplinary nature of AI-human factors in healthcare, the plan should address potential recruitment challenges, ethical approvals (given clinical involvement), and timescales required for iterative interface refinement and impact measurements. Enhancing the experiment plan with these concrete details will better demonstrate the practical feasibility of conducting rigorous user studies and impact assessments critical to validating the novel explainability module within a healthcare setting. Finally, specifying fallback strategies for slower or less effective explanation mechanisms within the experiment design phase will strengthen robustness and feasibility. This detailed planning directly supports the Proposed_Method and the intended measured outcomes from the Test_Case_Examples."

          "feedback_content": "To strengthen the novelty and impact beyond the currently competitive scope, consider integrating behavioral intention and acceptance modeling frameworks such as the extended UTAUT model into the evaluation phase. This could systematically quantify social influence, perceived risk, and effort expectancy factors influencing healthcare providers' adoption of explainable conversational AI. Combining these socio-technical acceptance models with the core explainability developments can uniquely position the work at the intersection of AI interpretability and healthcare technology adoption research. Moreover, embedding clinical domain adaptation techniques using concepts like social actor representation and virtual patient care scenarios can further ground explanations in user context and social dynamics, boosting real-world relevance and uptake. Such an approach would also open pathways to model and empirically analyze factors influencing self-management in chronic disease contexts or mental health professional decision support, expanding applicability. This integration is well-aligned with the listed Globally-Linked Concepts and would enhance both novelty and broader impact, addressing gaps in understanding factors affecting healthcare AI adoption while offering explainability tailored to clinical workflows."
