For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'A Metaverse: Taxonomy, Components, Applications, and Open Challenges', 'abstract': 'Unlike previous studies on the Metaverse based on Second Life, the current Metaverse is based on the social value of Generation Z that online and offline selves are not different. With the technological development of deep learning-based high-precision recognition models and natural generation models, Metaverse is being strengthened with various factors, from mobile-based always-on access to connectivity with reality using virtual currency. The integration of enhanced social activities and neural-net methods requires a new definition of Metaverse suitable for the present, different from the previous Metaverse. This paper divides the concepts and essential techniques necessary for realizing the Metaverse into three components (i.e., hardware, software, and contents) and three approaches (i.e., user interaction, implementation, and application) rather than marketing or hardware approach to conduct a comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, we describe essential methods based on three components and techniques to Metaverseâ€™s representative Ready Player One, Roblox, and Facebook research in the domain of films, games, and studies. Finally, we summarize the limitations and directions for implementing the immersive Metaverse as social influences, constraints, and open challenges.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Building Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models on Google Cloud Platform, A Comprehensive Guide for Beginners', 'abstract': 'Take a systematic approach to understanding the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning from the ground up and how they are applied in practice. You will use this comprehensive guide for building and deploying learning models to address complex use cases while leveraging the computational resources of Google Cloud Platform. Author Ekaba Bisong shows you how machine learning tools and techniques are used to predict or classify events based on a set of interactions between variables known as features or attributes in a particular dataset.

The chapters of this book span three categories: The basics of neural networks: Many traditional machine learning models can be understood as special cases of neural networks. An emphasis is placed in the first two chapters on understanding the relationship between traditional machine learning and neural networks. Support vector machines, linear/logistic regression, singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, and recommender systems are shown to be special cases of neural networks. These methods are studied together with recent feature engineering methods like word2vec. Fundamentals of neural networks: A detailed discussion of training and regularization is provided in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapters 5 and 6 present radial-basis function (RBF) networks and restricted Boltzmann machines. Advanced topics in neural networks: Chapters 7 and8 discuss recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Several advanced topics like deep reinforcement learning, neural Turing machines, Kohonen self-organizing maps, and generative adversarial networks are introduced in Chapters 9 and 10.

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method\\nstill requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of\\nthousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language\\ntask from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which\\ncurrent NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up\\nlanguage models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes\\neven reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning\\napproaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with\\n175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model,\\nand test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is\\napplied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot\\ndemonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3\\nachieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,\\nquestion-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require\\non-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a\\nnovel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time,\\nwe also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles,\\nas well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to\\ntraining on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples\\nof news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from\\narticles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding\\nand of GPT-3 in general.\"}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Forecasting: theory and practice', 'abstract': 'Forecasting has always been at the forefront of decision making and planning. The uncertainty that surrounds the future is both exciting and challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise risks and maximise utilities. The large number of forecasting applications calls for a diverse set of forecasting methods to tackle real-life challenges. This article provides a non-systematic review of the theory and the practice of forecasting. We provide an overview of a wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles, and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety of real-life contexts. We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and applications. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of forecasting theory and practice. Given its encyclopedic nature, the intended mode of reading is non-linear. We offer cross-references to allow the readers to navigate through the various topics. We complement the theoretical concepts and applications covered by large lists of free or open-source software implementations and publicly-available databases.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained language models', 'abstract': 'With the prevalence of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and the pre-trainingâ€“fine-tuning paradigm, it has been continuously shown that larger models tend to yield better performance. However, as PLMs scale up, fine-tuning and storing all the parameters is prohibitively costly and eventually becomes practically infeasible. This necessitates a new branch of research focusing on the parameter-efficient adaptation of PLMs, which optimizes a small portion of the model parameters while keeping the rest fixed, drastically cutting down computation and storage costs. In general, it demonstrates that large-scale models could be effectively stimulated by the optimization of a few parameters. Despite the various designs, here we discuss and analyse the approaches under a more consistent and accessible term â€˜delta-tuningâ€™, where â€˜deltaâ€™ a mathematical notation often used to denote changes, is borrowed to refer to the portion of parameters that are â€˜changedâ€™ during training. We formally describe the problem and propose a unified categorization criterion for existing delta-tuning methods to explore their correlations and differences. We also discuss the theoretical principles underlying the effectiveness of delta-tuning and interpret them from the perspectives of optimization and optimal control. Furthermore, we provide a holistic empirical study on over 100 natural language processing tasks and investigate various aspects of delta-tuning. With comprehensive study and analysis, our research demonstrates the theoretical and practical properties of delta-tuning in the adaptation of PLMs.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Deep learning modelling techniques: current progress, applications, advantages, and challenges', 'abstract': 'Deep learning (DL) is revolutionizing evidence-based decision-making techniques that can be applied across various sectors. Specifically, it possesses the ability to utilize two or more levels of non-linear feature transformation of the given data via representation learning in order to overcome limitations posed by large datasets. As a multidisciplinary field that is still in its nascent phase, articles that survey DL architectures encompassing the full scope of the field are rather limited. Thus, this paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-art DL modelling techniques and provides insights into their advantages and challenges. It was found that many of the models exhibit a highly domain-specific efficiency and could be trained by two or more methods. However, training DL models can be very time-consuming, expensive, and requires huge samples for better accuracy. Since DL is also susceptible to deception and misclassification and tends to get stuck on local minima, improved optimization of parameters is required to create more robust models. Regardless, DL has already been leading to groundbreaking results in the healthcare, education, security, commercial, industrial, as well as government sectors. Some models, like the convolutional neural network (CNN), generative adversarial networks (GAN), recurrent neural network (RNN), recursive neural networks, and autoencoders, are frequently used, while the potential of other models remains widely unexplored. Pertinently, hybrid conventional DL architectures have the capacity to overcome the challenges experienced by conventional models. Considering that capsule architectures may dominate future DL models, this work aimed to compile information for stakeholders involved in the development and use of DL models in the contemporary world.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Springer Handbook of Robotics', 'abstract': 'The second edition of this handbook provides a state-of-the-art cover view on the various aspects in the rapidly developing field of robotics. Reaching for the human frontier, robotics is vigorously engaged in the growing challenges of new emerging domains.

    "current_research_landscape": "The cluster of research synthesized here centers on advancing machine learning and deep learning methodologies, particularly neural network architectures and generative models, to improve language understanding tasks. Central nodes such as 'Google Cloud Platform,' 'neural net method,' and 'deep learning models' underscore a technical ecosystem leveraging scalable cloud infrastructures for large-scale model training and deployment. The thematic islands reveal three main sub-domains: (1) foundational machine learning and data science practices including model building and platform utilization, (2) generative and recognition neural methods often exemplified through applied research such as Facebook-related studies and hardware considerations, and (3) frameworks around the implementation of AI with a strong focus on explainable AI (XAI) to ensure responsible and interpretable model deployment. Papers such as the GPT-3 study emphasize few-shot learning capabilities, highlighting an archetype for tackling low-resource language scenarios without extensive fine-tuning datasets. Together, these form a robust landscape aiming to harness large pretrained language models and scalable cloud resources to enable more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable NLP systems.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps emerge primarily in the areas of model explainability (XAI) and the efficiency of adapting large models to domain-specific or resource-scarce languages. There is a significant challenge in balancing model scale with parameter-efficient tuning, as noted in delta-tuning research, which while promising, remains underexplored in multilingual and low-resource contexts. Moreover, despite advances in deep learning frameworks and cloud infrastructure deployment, the field still faces practical challenges in achieving trustworthy, interpretable, and accountable AI suited for real-world settings. The bridge node of 'Google Cloud Platform' indicates a potential bottleneck or lever point for integrating these aspects effectively. Externally, the global GPS analysis reveals neglected cross-disciplinary opportunities linking 'data science' with 'generative models' and 'implementation of AI methods' with healthcare-related systems. These hidden bridges suggest that concepts like clinical decision support systems, quality implementation frameworks, and human-robot interaction strategies could provide novel paradigms and methodological rigor to address model adaptation, interpretability, and acceptance in NLP for low-resource languages. For instance, incorporating healthcare implementation science could illuminate structured deployment and evaluation frameworks currently lacking in NLP applications, thereby bridging technological potential with practical, context-sensitive use cases.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate implementation science frameworks from healthcare (e.g., 'Quality Implementation Framework,' 'Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research') with the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigms (delta-tuning) seen in the foundational machine learning cluster. This can address the internal gap of bridging model adaptivity and practical, systematic deployment in low-resource language settings, improving model accountability and real-world utility.\n\nOpportunity 2: Employ human-robot interaction and social robotics principlesâ€”as identified in the hidden bridge between 'generative models' and 'implementation of AI methods'â€”to develop interactive, multimodal language learning and evaluation platforms that facilitate low-resource language understanding, providing richer contextual grounding and user-centric model feedback.\n\nOpportunity 3: Leverage cloud-based data science workflows, specifically within Google Cloud Platform infrastructures, combined with generative model innovations, to create scalable, explainable AI pipelines. These pipelines would specifically target the transparency and interpretability challenges elucidated in XAI literature, making large language models more accessible and reliable for low-resource language applications in various fields including public health, education, and governance."
