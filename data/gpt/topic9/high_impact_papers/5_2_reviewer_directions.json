    "title": "Healthcare AI-inspired Bias Detection Modules Incorporating Anomaly Detection in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Subtle and emergent biases in dynamic social media streams evade detection by current LLM fairness modules, limiting responsible AI deployment.",
    "Motivation": "Leverages hidden bridges with healthcare AI and anomaly detection to design rigorous bias detection/correction modules within LLMsâ€”novel cross-domain transfer to advance bias recognition capabilities for social media analysis.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a hybrid LLM framework embedding specialized anomaly detection algorithms inspired by clinical AI systems. Utilize statistical and machine learning-based outlier detection on LLM output patterns, combined with domain knowledge from healthcare bias diagnostics to flag anomalous social media text indicative of emerging biases. Integrate a corrective feedback loop to retrain LLM components dynamically.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compile real-time social media streams with annotated emergent bias events. 2) Implement anomaly detection techniques inspired by healthcare AI literature (e.g., temporal pattern analysis, feature outlier models). 3) Embed modules into LLM pipelines for bias flagging and correction. 4) Evaluate detection accuracy, false positives, and adaptability over time with emerging bias scenarios.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sudden increase of xenophobic slurs in posts after geopolitical events. Output: Anomaly detection flags unusual pattern shifts, bias detection module raises alerts with explanations, triggering automated mitigation measures.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If anomaly detection integration impedes performance, explore lightweight ensemble approaches combining static bias classifiers with anomaly scoring. Alternatively, simulate surrogate anomaly data to tune detection sensitivity before full deployment."
