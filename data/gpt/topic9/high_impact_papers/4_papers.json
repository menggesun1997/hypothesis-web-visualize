    "abstract": "Forecasting has always been at the forefront of decision making and planning. The uncertainty that surrounds the future is both exciting and challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise risks and maximise utilities. The large number of forecasting applications calls for a diverse set of forecasting methods to tackle real-life challenges. This article provides a non-systematic review of the theory and the practice of forecasting. We provide an overview of a wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles, and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety of real-life contexts. We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and applications. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of forecasting theory and practice. Given its encyclopedic nature, the intended mode of reading is non-linear. We offer cross-references to allow the readers to navigate through the various topics. We complement the theoretical concepts and applications covered by large lists of free or open-source software implementations and publicly-available databases.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for intelligent services, the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will shift from a traditional architecture that focuses solely on a high transmission rate to a new architecture that is based on the intelligent connection of everything. Semantic communication (SemCom), a revolutionary architecture that integrates user as well as application requirements and the meaning of information into data processing and transmission, is predicted to become a new core paradigm in 6G. While SemCom is expected to progress beyond the classical Shannon paradigm, several obstacles need to be overcome on the way to a SemCom-enabled smart Internet. In this paper, we first highlight the motivations and compelling reasons for SemCom in 6G. Then, we provide an overview of SemCom-related theory development. After that, we introduce three types of SemCom, i.e., semantic-oriented communication, goal-oriented communication, and semantic-aware communication. Following that, we organize the design of the communication system into three dimensions, i.e., semantic information (SI) extraction, SI transmission, and SI metrics. For each dimension, we review existing techniques and discuss their benefits and limitations, as well as the remaining challenges. Then, we introduce the potential applications of SemCom in 6G and portray the vision of future SemCom-empowered network architecture. Finally, we outline future research opportunities. In a nutshell, this paper provides a holistic review of the fundamentals of SemCom, its applications in 6G networks, and the existing challenges and open issues with insights for further in-depth investigations.",

    "fieldCitationRatio": 108.62,
    "abstract": "AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., BERT,\nDALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a\nwide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to\nunderscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report\nprovides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation\nmodels, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics,\nreasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model\narchitectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation,\ntheory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal\nimpact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and\nethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep\nlearning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent\ncapabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes\nhomogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution,\nas the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models\ndownstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models,\nwe currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and\nwhat they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these\nquestions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will\nrequire deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their\nfundamentally sociotechnical nature.",

    "abstract": "The sixth generation (6G) wireless systems are envisioned to enable the paradigm shift from “connected things” to “connected intelligence”, featured by ultra high density, large-scale, dynamic heterogeneity, diversified functional requirements, and machine learning capabilities, which leads to a growing need for highly efficient intelligent algorithms. The classic optimization-based algorithms usually require highly precise mathematical model of data links and suffer from poor performance with high computational cost in realistic 6G applications. Based on domain knowledge (e.g., optimization models and theoretical tools), machine learning (ML) stands out as a promising and viable methodology for many complex large-scale optimization problems in 6G, due to its superior performance, computational efficiency, scalability, and generalizability. In this paper, we systematically review the most representative “learning to optimize” techniques in diverse domains of 6G wireless networks by identifying the inherent feature of the underlying optimization problem and investigating the specifically designed ML frameworks from the perspective of optimization. In particular, we will cover algorithm unrolling, learning to branch-and-bound, graph neural network for structured optimization, deep reinforcement learning for stochastic optimization, end-to-end learning for semantic optimization, as well as wireless federated learning for distributed optimization, which are capable of addressing challenging large-scale problems arising from a variety of crucial wireless applications. Through the in-depth discussion, we shed light on the excellent performance of ML-based optimization algorithms with respect to the classical methods, and provide insightful guidance to develop advanced ML techniques in 6G networks. Neural network design, theoretical tools of different ML methods, implementation issues, as well as challenges and future research directions are also discussed to support the practical use of the ML model in 6G wireless networks.",

    "abstract": "Modern humanity with some 5,000 years of recorded history has been experiencing growing pains, with no end in sight. It is high time for humanity to grow up and to transcend itself by embracing transhumanism. Transhumanism offers the most inclusive ideology for all ethnicities and races, the religious and the atheists, conservatives and liberals, the young and the old regardless of socioeconomic status, gender identity, or any other individual qualities. This book expounds on contemporary views and practical advice from more than 70 transhumanists. Astronaut Neil Armstrong said on the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, “One small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.” Transhumanism is the next logical step in the evolution of humankind, and it is the existential solution to the long-term survival of the human race.",

    "abstract": "The Springer Handbook of Augmented Reality presents a comprehensive and authoritative guide to augmented reality (AR) technology, its numerous applications, and its intersection with emerging technologies. This book traces the history of AR from its early development, discussing the fundamentals of AR and its associated science. The handbook begins by presenting the development of AR over the last few years, mentioning the key pioneers and important milestones. It then moves to the fundamentals and principles of AR, such as photogrammetry, optics, motion and objects tracking, and marker-based and marker-less registration. The book discusses both software toolkits and techniques and hardware related to AR, before presenting the applications of AR. This includes both end-user applications like education and cultural heritage, and professional applications within engineering fields, medicine and architecture, amongst others. The book concludes with the convergence of AR with other emerging technologies, such as Industrial Internet of Things and Digital Twins. The handbook presents a comprehensive reference on AR technology from an academic, industrial and commercial perspective, making it an invaluable resource for audiences from a variety of backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "Edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning algorithms, are gradually intersecting to build the novel system, namely edge intelligence. However, the development of edge intelligence systems encounters several challenges, and one of these challenges is the computational gap between computation-intensive deep learning algorithms and less-capable edge systems. Due to the computational gap, many edge intelligence systems cannot meet the expected performance requirements. To bridge the gap, a plethora of new techniques and optimization methods were proposed in the past years: lightweight deep learning models, network compression, and efficient neural architecture search. Although some reviews or surveys have partially covered this large body of literature, we lack a systematic and comprehensive review to discuss all aspects of these deep learning techniques which are critical for edge intelligence implementation. As various and diverse methods, applicable to edge systems, are proposed, a holistic review would enable edge computing engineers and the community to understand the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques that are instrumental for edge intelligence and to facilitate the development of edge intelligence systems. This paper surveys the representative and latest deep learning techniques that are useful for edge intelligence systems, including hand-crafted models, model compression, hardware-aware neural architecture search, and adaptive deep learning models. Finally, based on observations and simple experiments we conducted, we discuss some future directions.",
