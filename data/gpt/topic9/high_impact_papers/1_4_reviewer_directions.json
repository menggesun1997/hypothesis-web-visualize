    "title": "Social-Robot-Guided Data Augmentation for Low-Resource Language Learning",
    "Problem_Statement": "Data scarcity in low-resource languages impedes effective training of large language models, and existing augmentation methods often lack contextual relevance and user adaptability.",
    "Motivation": "Utilizing social robotics principles, this project introduces an adaptive, user-guided data augmentation strategy through conversational agents that generate contextually relevant synthetic data, bridging the gap between generative models and AI implementation in NLP.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a social robot simulation interface where native or proxy speakers interactively generate paraphrases, corrections, and scenario variations. These interactions produce context-rich synthetic data augmenting low-resource language corpora. The approach dynamically adapts augmentation strategies based on user feedback and model performance improvements.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop simulation platform incorporating user dialog with generative LLM backends. 2. Collect augmented dataset via interactive sessions. 3. Fine-tune base LLMs with augmented data for NLP tasks. 4. Benchmark improvements against static augmentation and no augmentation baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Sample Input: Simple sentence in a low-resource language. Output: Multiple user-guided paraphrases and contextual elaborations forming a richer training dataset, ultimately improving downstream task accuracy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If user interactions do not produce quality augmentations, fallback to semi-automated augmentation frameworks with post-hoc validation by linguistic experts or crowd workers."

          "feedback_content": "While the concept of a social-robot-guided interface for data augmentation is intriguing, the proposal lacks clarity on how user interactions will effectively guarantee the generation of high-quality and diverse synthetic data that truly captures linguistic nuances of low-resource languages. Detailed mechanisms for capturing, validating, and integrating user feedback dynamically into the augmentation pipeline should be elaborated to establish conceptual soundness and differentiate from conventional human-in-the-loop approaches in NLP data augmentation. Consider specifying algorithms or interaction models that adapt augmentation strategies based on explicit user signals or model performance metrics to solidify the method's rationale and feasibility within the framework of large language models and social robotics principles. This extension will clarify assumptions and operational flow, ensuring the mechanism is not just plausible but grounded in concrete steps and theoretical foundations that the community can evaluate rigorously. Targeting Proposed_Method section for this enhancement is critical to reduce conceptual ambiguity and increase reviewer confidence in the core methodology's soundness and innovativeness."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty screening marked the idea as NOV-COMPETITIVE, to further boost impact and distinctiveness, integrate interdisciplinary insights and methodologies from 'robot-assisted language learning' and 'social neuroscientists'. Leveraging evidence from social neuroscience about human-robot interaction dynamics could help design socially attuned adaptive dialogue mechanisms that enhance user engagement and learning outcomes in the augmentation process. Additionally, incorporating findings from 'second language acquisition' and 'adult learners' would enable tailoring the system specifically for adult low-resource language users, potentially increasing relevance, adoption, and efficacy. This integration can move the project beyond a generative data augmentation tool into a socio-cognitive AI system that not only augments data but also facilitates measurable language learning improvements and user-centered adaptive feedback, thus broadening scientific impact and real-world applicability. Target the Proposed_Method and Motivation sections to embed these concepts, making the approach more holistic and connecting core AI with language learning theory and social robotics insights."
