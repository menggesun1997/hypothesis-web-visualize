    "title": "Culturally Adaptive Explainability Models for Multilingual Legal AI Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing explainability methods inadequately adapt to cultural and linguistic diversity inherent in global legal systems, risking misunderstanding and decreased trust among non-English legal professionals.",
    "Motivation": "This idea targets the external novel gap relating to user-adaptive explanation systems, challenging homogenous explanation paradigms by enabling culture-aware explainability generation tailored to linguistic nuances and jurisdictional norms via NLP and XAI cross-fertilization.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop multilingual explanation generation models that incorporate cultural context embedding layers reflecting jurisdiction-specific legal norms, translation peculiarities, and discourse conventions. Use user profiling and active learning to adapt explanation style, terminology, and detail complexity per target culture and language.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multilingual legal datasets with annotation on cultural/legal context. 2. Fine-tune multilingual LLMs with added cultural embeddings. 3. Design adaptive explanation generators modulating style and content. 4. Validate with native legal experts across cultures assessing explanation appropriateness and trust. 5. Compare with monolingual and culture-agnostic baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Legal contract clause translated with explanation tailored for French vs. Japanese lawyers. Output: Culture-sensitive explanation emphasizing jurisdiction-specific issues and terminology. Expected: Higher expert ratings on clarity and relevance.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cultural embedding fails, fallback to rule-based style transfer mechanisms combined with manual glossary mappings."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks detailed discussion on the challenges and specifics of data collection, especially regarding obtaining high-quality multilingual legal datasets sufficiently annotated with cultural and jurisdictional nuances. Given the complexity of legal language and cultural context, more concrete steps on dataset sourcing, annotation protocols, and ensuring inter-annotator reliability across cultures are essential. Additionally, active learning and user profiling components need clearer experimental designs for adaptation iterations and metrics to evaluate adaptation success over time. Strengthening the feasibility by detailing these aspects will increase confidence in execution viability and replicability of results. Recommend including fallback strategies for insufficient data scenarios or data imbalance among jurisdictions in the plan section to further solidify feasibility and robustness of the experimentation approach: e.g., synthetic data augmentation or crowdsourced annotations validated by legal experts from diverse jurisdictions, and clear criteria for expert selection and evaluation benchmarks in step 4 (validation). This will improve rigour and practicability of the experimental plan substantially, which currently reads high-level and under-specified for a premier conference submission review stage. Targeting this critical methodology clarity will enhance assessability and reviewer confidence in the work’s execution quality and reproducibility potential .  Target section: Experiment_Plan (Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating and to improve impact and novelty, the proposal could strategically integrate the notion of 'legal decision-making process' and aspects of 'General Data Protection Regulation' (GDPR) compliance within culturally adaptive explanations. For example, adapting explanations not only linguistically and culturally but also to jurisdiction-specific legal standards related to data privacy and user rights could offer a compelling novel angle linking NLP, XAI, and regulatory compliance — an area increasingly important for legal AI systems globally. Incorporating a customer feedback loop from legal professionals interacting with the system to iteratively refine culturally and regulation-aware explanations would further increase applicability and demonstrate business application relevance. This multidisciplinary integration strengthens both practical impact and competitive edge, making the solution more compelling for deployment in real-world multilingual legal environments facing complex regulatory constraints. Recommending explicit inclusion and testing of these elements within the experimental plan and motivation sections to elevate both novelty and societal impact of the work.
