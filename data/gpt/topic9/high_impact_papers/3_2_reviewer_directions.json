    "title": "Cross-domain Robustness Augmentation of Legal LLM Explanations Using Cybersecurity XAI Techniques",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM explanations for legal AI applications are vulnerable to adversarial inputs, reducing trustworthiness and safety, a critical problem unaddressed in current legal AI deployments.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the external novel gap by importing robustness and accountability methods from cybersecurity XAI, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) combined with intrusion detection heuristics, bridging 'deployment of AI' and 'XAI techniques' to enhance legal LLM explanation safety—an audacious cross-field innovation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a dual-layer explanation verification system: 1) LLM generates explanations with SHAP attributions highlighting feature importance in legal texts; 2) An intrusion-detection style module monitors explanation consistency, detecting anomalies or manipulations indicative of adversarial attacks or model drift. The system filters or flags suspicious explanations, integrating robustness guarantees with explainability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble legal datasets plus synthetically adversarial perturbations. 2. Train/fine-tune LLMs for legal reasoning. 3. Generate SHAP-based explanations for predictions. 4. Develop heuristic and ML-based detectors inspired by cybersecurity IDS to identify adversarial explanations or inconsistencies. 5. Measure detection accuracy, false positives, and overall explanation robustness through adversarial testing. 6. Conduct expert evaluation for trustworthiness improvements.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Contract clause modified with subtle adversarial perturbation causing LLM prediction shift. Output: SHAP explanation plus alert flag signaling explanation inconsistency or manipulation. Expected: Early detection of attack preventing erroneous legal interpretation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If IDS-inspired detection yields high false positives, fallback to ensemble explanation consistency checks combined with robust training of LLM models against adversarial samples."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a dual-layer explanation verification system combining SHAP attributions with an intrusion-detection style module. However, it lacks precise details on how the intrusion detection heuristics will be adapted or designed specifically for textual explanation outputs in the legal domain. The mechanism by which anomalies or manipulations in SHAP explanations are characterized and differentiated from legitimate interpretation shifts remains underspecified. Clarify how the IDS-inspired module will handle natural variability in explanations without excessive false alarms, and specify the criteria or features used to detect adversarial explanations to strengthen soundness and credibility of the approach in this new context, where legal language complexity poses unique challenges. Consider including a formal threat model and analysis of SHAP explanation distribution under adversarial vs. benign inputs to support the mechanism’s validity and robustness assumptions in Proposed_Method."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is ambitious but would benefit from refinement to ensure scientific rigor and practical feasibility: (1) The plan to generate synthetically adversarial perturbations in legal text needs concrete methods described, since adversarial attacks in NLP are non-trivial and domain-specific. Specify techniques or existing benchmarks to guide reproducibility. (2) Training or fine-tuning LLMs for legal reasoning requires clarifying model scale, data volume, and evaluation protocols to avoid overly optimistic assumptions. (3) The detection evaluation should explicitly include baseline comparisons to simpler or existing XAI robustness approaches to prove added value of IDS-inspired detectors. (4) Expert evaluations are good but may be costly; plans for scalable proxies or user studies to quantify trustworthiness improvements would increase feasibility. Overall, strengthening experimental design details and including contingency metrics around false positives and real-world inputs will improve practical assessment of the idea."
