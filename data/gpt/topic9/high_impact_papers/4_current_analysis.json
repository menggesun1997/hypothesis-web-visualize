The uncertainty that surrounds the future is both exciting and challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise risks and maximise utilities. The large number of forecasting applications calls for a diverse set of forecasting methods to tackle real-life challenges. This article provides a non-systematic review of the theory and the practice of forecasting. We provide an overview of a wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles, and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety of real-life contexts. We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and applications. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of forecasting theory and practice. Given its encyclopedic nature, the intended mode of reading is non-linear. We offer cross-references to allow the readers to navigate through the various topics. We complement the theoretical concepts and applications covered by large lists of free or open-source software implementations and publicly-available databases.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Semantic Communications for Future Internet: Fundamentals, Applications, and Challenges', 'abstract': 'With the increasing demand for intelligent services, the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will shift from a traditional architecture that focuses solely on a high transmission rate to a new architecture that is based on the intelligent connection of everything. Semantic communication (SemCom), a revolutionary architecture that integrates user as well as application requirements and the meaning of information into data processing and transmission, is predicted to become a new core paradigm in 6G. While SemCom is expected to progress beyond the classical Shannon paradigm, several obstacles need to be overcome on the way to a SemCom-enabled smart Internet. In this paper, we first highlight the motivations and compelling reasons for SemCom in 6G. Then, we provide an overview of SemCom-related theory development. After that, we introduce three types of SemCom, i.e., semantic-oriented communication, goal-oriented communication, and semantic-aware communication. Following that, we organize the design of the communication system into three dimensions, i.e., semantic information (SI) extraction, SI transmission, and SI metrics. For each dimension, we review existing techniques and discuss their benefits and limitations, as well as the remaining challenges. Then, we introduce the potential applications of SemCom in 6G and portray the vision of future SemCom-empowered network architecture. Finally, we outline future research opportunities. In a nutshell, this paper provides a holistic review of the fundamentals of SemCom, its applications in 6G networks, and the existing challenges and open issues with insights for further in-depth investigations.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models', 'abstract': 'AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., BERT,\\nDALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a\\nwide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to\\nunderscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report\\nprovides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation\\nmodels, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics,\\nreasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model\\narchitectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation,\\ntheory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal\\nimpact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and\\nethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep\\nlearning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent\\ncapabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes\\nhomogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution,\\nas the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models\\ndownstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models,\\nwe currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and\\nwhat they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these\\nquestions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will\\nrequire deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their\\nfundamentally sociotechnical nature.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Machine Learning for Large-Scale Optimization in 6G Wireless Networks', 'abstract': 'The sixth generation (6G) wireless systems are envisioned to enable the paradigm shift from “connected things” to “connected intelligence”, featured by ultra high density, large-scale, dynamic heterogeneity, diversified functional requirements, and machine learning capabilities, which leads to a growing need for highly efficient intelligent algorithms. The classic optimization-based algorithms usually require highly precise mathematical model of data links and suffer from poor performance with high computational cost in realistic 6G applications. Based on domain knowledge (e.g., optimization models and theoretical tools), machine learning (ML) stands out as a promising and viable methodology for many complex large-scale optimization problems in 6G, due to its superior performance, computational efficiency, scalability, and generalizability. In this paper, we systematically review the most representative “learning to optimize” techniques in diverse domains of 6G wireless networks by identifying the inherent feature of the underlying optimization problem and investigating the specifically designed ML frameworks from the perspective of optimization. In particular, we will cover algorithm unrolling, learning to branch-and-bound, graph neural network for structured optimization, deep reinforcement learning for stochastic optimization, end-to-end learning for semantic optimization, as well as wireless federated learning for distributed optimization, which are capable of addressing challenging large-scale problems arising from a variety of crucial wireless applications. Through the in-depth discussion, we shed light on the excellent performance of ML-based optimization algorithms with respect to the classical methods, and provide insightful guidance to develop advanced ML techniques in 6G networks. Neural network design, theoretical tools of different ML methods, implementation issues, as well as challenges and future research directions are also discussed to support the practical use of the ML model in 6G wireless networks.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Proceedings of 3rd International Conference on Machine Learning, Advances in Computing, Renewable Energy and Communication, MARC 2021', 'abstract': 'This book gathers selected papers presented at International Conference on Machine Learning, Advances in Computing, Renewable Energy and Communication (MARC 2021), held in Krishna Engineering College, Ghaziabad, India, during 10 – 11 December, 2021.

It is high time for humanity to grow up and to transcend itself by embracing transhumanism. Transhumanism offers the most inclusive ideology for all ethnicities and races, the religious and the atheists, conservatives and liberals, the young and the old regardless of socioeconomic status, gender identity, or any other individual qualities.

However, the development of edge intelligence systems encounters several challenges, and one of these challenges is the computational gap between computation-intensive deep learning algorithms and less-capable edge systems. Due to the computational gap, many edge intelligence systems cannot meet the expected performance requirements. To bridge the gap, a plethora of new techniques and optimization methods were proposed in the past years: lightweight deep learning models, network compression, and efficient neural architecture search. Although some reviews or surveys have partially covered this large body of literature, we lack a systematic and comprehensive review to discuss all aspects of these deep learning techniques which are critical for edge intelligence implementation. As various and diverse methods, applicable to edge systems, are proposed, a holistic review would enable edge computing engineers and the community to understand the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques that are instrumental for edge intelligence and to facilitate the development of edge intelligence systems. This paper surveys the representative and latest deep learning techniques that are useful for edge intelligence systems, including hand-crafted models, model compression, hardware-aware neural architecture search, and adaptive deep learning models.

    "current_research_landscape": "This research cluster centrally addresses the challenge of deploying state-of-the-art deep learning models, especially large language models (LLMs) trained via transfer learning, onto resource-constrained edge devices within the Internet of Things (IoT) environments for natural language processing (NLP) applications. The core problem involves bridging the computational gap between highly accurate, large-scale deep learning models and the limited computational, memory, and energy resources on edge devices. The thematic islands reveal two dominant paradigms: (1) the development and deployment of state-of-the-art models through encyclopedic and open-source software implementations, ensuring reproducibility and accessibility; and (2) foundational standard deep learning and transfer learning techniques to adapt large models effectively for diverse downstream NLP tasks. The methods surveyed include model compression, network pruning, hardware-aware neural architecture search, algorithm unrolling, and federated learning, highlighting both theoretical and practical system-level strategies. The sociotechnical nature of these models—their interaction with application requirements and societal impact—is also recognized as a crucial consideration.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite advances, significant internal gaps remain, including a lack of systematic approaches that unify model optimization techniques (e.g., compression, architecture search) with efficient deployment frameworks tailored for heterogeneous edge hardware. The absence of bridge nodes linking the thematic clusters suggests siloed development between model innovation and software implementation strategies, potentially impeding integrated solutions. Moreover, foundational papers note limited understanding of emergent properties and failure modes of foundation models when adapted to edge settings, raising risks of degraded accuracy or unintended biases in resource-limited contexts. External/Novel Gaps: The global context analysis identifies a hidden bridge between 'state-of-the-art' and 'transfer learning' with concepts like semi-supervised learning frameworks, knowledge distillation, recurrent neural networks, and human activity recognition datasets. These connections suggest overlooked opportunities to apply semi-supervised and pseudo-supervised learning, along with knowledge distillation techniques tailored to edge environments, to overcome data scarcity and optimize inference efficiency. Incorporating domain-specific datasets (e.g., medical, sensor-based) and recurrent architectures might enable more robust edge NLP models by addressing class imbalance and inference latency—challenges not explicitly covered in the core papers. This cross-disciplinary insight could help transform existing state-of-the-art models into lightweight, adaptive, and context-aware edge solutions.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate semi-supervised learning and pseudo-supervision techniques (from the global hidden bridges) with transfer learning frameworks (local thematic island) to craft data-efficient, compressed LLM variants optimized for edge NLP tasks in IoT scenarios. This addresses the limitation of labeled data scarcity and computational overhead highlighted in foundational papers.\n\nOpportunity 2: Develop a unified framework combining knowledge distillation methods with hardware-aware neural architecture search from the state-of-the-art model cluster, enabling dynamic model adaptation to heterogeneous edge devices while preserving downstream NLP task performance. This bridges the current silo between software implementation and model design.\n\nOpportunity 3: Leverage recurrent neural networks and semi-supervised learning schemes informed by human activity recognition datasets to enhance contextual understanding and real-time adaptation of LLMs on edge devices, mitigating inference latency and accuracy degradation risks identified as emergent behavior challenges of foundation models in edge contexts."
