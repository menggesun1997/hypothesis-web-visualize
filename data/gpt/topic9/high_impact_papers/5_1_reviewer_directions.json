    "title": "Explainable Socio-Technical Fairness Framework (ESTFF) for Social Media LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing fairness solutions for social media text analysis lack transparency and fail to incorporate socio-technical factors critical for real-world adoption and ethical deployment.",
    "Motivation": "Directly addresses the gap connecting XAI methods with socio-technical adoption models, promoting transparent and accountable AI systems that consider organizational and societal acceptanceâ€”a novel integration opportunity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop ESTFF, a layered framework combining state-of-the-art XAI techniques (e.g., SHAP, counterfactual explanations) with socio-technical modeling (technology acceptance models, organizational behavior theories). The framework generates interpretable fairness assessments and user-centric explanations tailored to stakeholder roles (users, moderators, organizations), facilitating transparent decision-making and trustworthy AI use in social media analysis.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble social media text datasets with fairness annotations. 2) Implement LLM-based bias detection models augmented with XAI explanation modules. 3) Survey organizational stakeholders to identify decision factors for AI adoption. 4) Integrate user feedback through interactive explanation interfaces. 5) Evaluate framework effectiveness using fairness metrics, explanation quality measures, and user trust/acceptance surveys.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Automated bias detection on political posts with controversial language. Output: ESTFF provides explanation highlighting bias features, links these to socio-technical concerns (e.g., potential censorship risk), and adjusts recommendations considering organizational policies to maximize ethical deployment acceptance.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If stakeholder integration proves complex, prototype modular interfaces focusing first on technical explainability, then incrementally incorporate socio-technical features. Use simulations or synthetic feedback to iterate design before full deployment."

          "feedback_content": "The current Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks detailed methodology on how socio-technical factors will be quantitatively evaluated and integrated with the XAI outputs. Specifically, the plan to Survey organizational stakeholders and Integrate user feedback requires more rigorous, replicable protocols to ensure reliability and generalizability of findings. Additionally, methods for measuring explanation quality and user trust should be clearly specified with validated metrics or scales. Providing these details will enhance the feasibility and scientific rigor of the framework's evaluation phases, making deployment and adoption findings more actionable and robust in real-world scenarios. Consider including iterative validation cycles with progressively complex user groups and detailed plans for data collection and analysis in socio-technical modeling steps to strengthen feasibility and reproducibility of the approach within social media LLM contexts.\n\nTarget Section: Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "To enhance novelty and impact, consider integrating concepts from 'human-centered design' and 'racial disparities' broadly within the ESTFF to deepen societal relevance and applicability. For instance, extending the framework to explicitly uncover and mitigate racial biases in social media LLM outputs, informed by human-centered participatory design methods, could differentiate the work from existing fairness approaches. This integration could also involve co-design sessions with affected communities and stakeholders to better align technical explanations with lived experiences, thereby increasing trust and adoption. Additionally, embedding this framework within practical domains like clinical decision support or healthcare outcomes (as analogues) may provide cross-domain insights and wider applicability, increasing the potential impact beyond social media analysis alone.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
