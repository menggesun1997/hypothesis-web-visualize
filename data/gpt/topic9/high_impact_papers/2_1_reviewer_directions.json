    "title": "LLM-Powered Clinician Communication Coaching Agent",
    "Problem_Statement": "Clinicians often lack effective, real-time feedback tools to improve their communication skills with patients, limiting care quality and patient understanding.",
    "Motivation": "Leverages high-potential Opportunity 1 by integrating health professions education methodologies with large language models for simulating and enhancing clinician-patient interactions, addressing gaps in clinician communication enhancement and ethical transparent AI use.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an AI assistant that analyzes live or recorded clinician-patient conversations using discourse analysis metrics, providing actionable, context-aware feedback on empathy, clarity, and medical jargon usage. It uses a hybrid architecture combining an LLM with critical language awareness algorithms and domain-specific communication pedagogy models.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble audio-visual recordings and transcripts of clinician-patient interactions with expert communication ratings. 2. Train the system to detect communication patterns and empathy signals. 3. Test generated coaching feedback against expert human feedback as ground truth using precision, recall, and user satisfaction scores. 4. Run pilot interventions where clinicians use the coach and measure improvement over time.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Transcript where clinician uses complex medical terms without explanation. Output: 'Suggestion: Simplify the phrase \"myocardial infarction\" to \"heart attack\" for better patient understanding and engagement.'",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time analysis is not feasible, switch to post-session automated feedback generation. If LLM struggles with domain-specific nuances, incorporate rule-based clinical communication guidelines as fallback heuristics."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks clarity and detail on several critical feasibility aspects. Specifically, the plan to assemble audio-visual recordings and transcripts with expert communication ratings is a challenging and resource-intensive task that needs explicit data sourcing strategies and ethical considerations addressed upfront. Moreover, training the system to accurately detect empathy signals and communication patterns requires well-defined annotation schemas and validation protocols, which are not described. The evaluation metrics mentioned (precision, recall, user satisfaction) are appropriate but would benefit from more precise operationalization (e.g., what constitutes ground truth, how satisfaction is measured, sample sizes). Pilot interventions should also incorporate control groups or randomized designs to robustly measure improvement over time. Enhancing this section with more concrete methodological details and contingency plans will strengthen the proposal’s feasibility significantly.\n\nFurthermore, the fallback plan is sensible but could better specify how and when to transition between real-time and post-session feedback, including system performance thresholds or clinician preferences. Incorporating iterative user testing phases could also improve system usability and acceptance before large-scale pilots. Addressing these feasibility concerns will increase confidence in the research execution and outcomes' reliability and validity.\n\nIn summary, the experiment plan needs deeper elaboration on data collection, annotation, validation, and rigorous experimental design to be truly feasible and scientifically robust, vital for success in this competitive research space.\n\nSuggestion: Elaborate data acquisition, annotation protocols, exact evaluation metrics, and pilot study design with comparative controls or baselines explicit in the Experiment_Plan section to improve clarity and feasibility assumptions.\n\nTarget Section: Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the linked concept of 'health professions education', integrating established educational frameworks and evidence-based communication curricula could significantly enhance both novelty and impact. For example, collaborating with or embedding modules aligned to international communication competency standards or recommendations from authoritative bodies in health professions education can provide a scaffold to the agent’s coaching feedback, grounding AI suggestions in rigorously validated pedagogical practices.\n\nAdditionally, exploring synergies with mental health chatbot research might extend the agent’s usability to sensitive patient interactions, such as those involving emotional distress, where nuanced empathy is critical. Incorporating customizable modules or adaptability features inspired by these chatbots could make the tool more versatile and impactful across diverse clinical contexts.\n\nConcretely, the authors could integrate international health communication training guidelines into the discourse analysis metrics or coaching algorithms to enhance transparency, ethical rigor, and acceptance by clinician educators.\n\nThis global integration approach can help the proposal stand out in a crowded field by embedding the LLM-powered solution in well-recognized educational paradigms, facilitating easier adoption and clearer impact pathways.\n\nTarget Section: Motivation"
