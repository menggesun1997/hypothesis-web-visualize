    "title": "Transparent Conversational AI with Explainability Modules Tailored for Healthcare Providers",
    "Problem_Statement": "Healthcare providers often distrust LLM-driven conversational AI due to lack of transparency and explainability in the AI's decision-making processes.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of transparency by combining critical language analysis and ethical AI to design explainability modules that produce user-friendly explanations contextualized for healthcare professionals.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an explainability interface that accompanies AI outputs with layered explanations: (1) linguistic influences highlighting discourse choices, (2) clinical evidence references, and (3) uncertainty quantification, all presented interactively to healthcare users for informed evaluation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop algorithms to extract and present explanations from LLM internals using attention visualization and concept attribution adapted to clinical context. 2. Conduct user studies with clinicians to evaluate interpretability and trust. 3. Measure impact on AI adoption rates and user satisfaction.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI recommends a treatment option. Output: Explanation panel shows key textual evidences, relevant clinical guidelines cited, and confidence score of recommendation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If complex explanation generation is too slow, default to summarizing key clinical guideline citations and confidence intervals. Provide toggle options for explanation detail levels."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The foundational assumption that attention visualization and concept attribution from LLM internals can be directly and reliably interpreted as explanations by healthcare providers requires more robust justification. Given known issues with attention as an explanation and the clinical sensitivity of AI recommendations, the proposal should clarify how it will validate the faithfulness and clinical relevance of such explanations to build genuine trust rather than just perceived transparency. Without this, the method risks producing misleading or superficial explanations that do not align with clinician decision needs or standards of care documentation, undermining soundness and user confidence in the system's outputs. Consider integrating formal explanation validity metrics or clinical expert iterative validation earlier in the method design phase to solidify this assumption's foundation and mitigate risks of misinterpretation or over-reliance on known-to-be-imperfect proxy explanation methods within LLMs in healthcare contexts, thereby ensuring methodological soundness and practical trustworthiness of the AI explanations provided to healthcare users in the deployment phase. This point targets the core Proposed_Method and Problem_Statement assumptions about explanation extraction and trust generation via the chosen techniques, which are critical to overall system reliability and acceptance by healthcare providers.  In summary, please clarify and empirically justify that the proposed explanation methods will yield valid and clinically meaningful insights rather than superficial or potentially misleading rationales that could deteriorate trust or safety in critical healthcare usage contexts, possibly referencing or adapting state-of-the-art interpretability approaches tailored specifically for healthcare LLM applications with verifiable clinical grounding and use case alignment (e.g., incorporating domain expert annotation or comparison to evidence-based clinical guidelines). Such clarifications would improve the conceptual and empirical soundness of the foundational assumptions underpinning the research idea and prevent overestimating explanation efficacy from LLM internals alone in sensitive healthcare environments, overall strengthening the scientific rigor of the approach before empirical trials with clinicians are conducted.  Additionally, addressing this uncertainty can better inform downstream experiment design and interpretation of user trust evaluations in the planned studies, especially since explanation fidelity is crucial for effective clinician-AI collaboration and adoption in medical decision support, which is central to the paper's motivation and impact claims."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The outlined Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks detail about sample size, participant diversity (e.g., range of healthcare providers' specialties or experience levels), and specific quantitative or qualitative metrics for assessing interpretability, trust, and adoption. For feasibility and reproducibility, the proposal should explicitly define evaluation protocols, such as standardized questionnaires for perceived usefulness (e.g., based on extended UTAUT model constructs like performance expectancy and effort expectancy), statistical methods for analyzing user trust changes, and control conditions (e.g., standard AI outputs without explanations). Furthermore, considering the competitive and interdisciplinary nature of AI-human factors in healthcare, the plan should address potential recruitment challenges, ethical approvals (given clinical involvement), and timescales required for iterative interface refinement and impact measurements. Enhancing the experiment plan with these concrete details will better demonstrate the practical feasibility of conducting rigorous user studies and impact assessments critical to validating the novel explainability module within a healthcare setting. Finally, specifying fallback strategies for slower or less effective explanation mechanisms within the experiment design phase will strengthen robustness and feasibility. This detailed planning directly supports the Proposed_Method and the intended measured outcomes from the Test_Case_Examples."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "To strengthen the novelty and impact beyond the currently competitive scope, consider integrating behavioral intention and acceptance modeling frameworks such as the extended UTAUT model into the evaluation phase. This could systematically quantify social influence, perceived risk, and effort expectancy factors influencing healthcare providers' adoption of explainable conversational AI. Combining these socio-technical acceptance models with the core explainability developments can uniquely position the work at the intersection of AI interpretability and healthcare technology adoption research. Moreover, embedding clinical domain adaptation techniques using concepts like social actor representation and virtual patient care scenarios can further ground explanations in user context and social dynamics, boosting real-world relevance and uptake. Such an approach would also open pathways to model and empirically analyze factors influencing self-management in chronic disease contexts or mental health professional decision support, expanding applicability. This integration is well-aligned with the listed Globally-Linked Concepts and would enhance both novelty and broader impact, addressing gaps in understanding factors affecting healthcare AI adoption while offering explainability tailored to clinical workflows."
