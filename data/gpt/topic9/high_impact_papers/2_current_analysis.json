The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Narrative Impact, Social and Cognitive Foundations', 'abstract': 'The impact of public narratives has been so broad (including effects on beliefs and behavior but extending beyond to emotion and personality), that the stakeholders in the process have been located across disciplines, institutions, governments, and, indeed, across epochs. Narrative Impact draws upon scholars in diverse branches of psychology and media research to explore the subjective experience of public narratives, the affordances of the narrative environment, and the roles played by narratives in both personal and collective spheres. The book brings together current theory and research presented primarily from an empirical psychological and communications perspective, as well as contributions from literary theory, sociology, and censorship studies. To be commensurate with the broad scope of influence of public narratives, the book includes the narrative mobilization of major social movements, the formation of self-concepts in young people, banning of texts in schools, the constraining impact of narratives on jurors in the court room, and the wide use of education entertainment to affect social changes. Taken together, the interdisciplinary nature of the book and its stellar list of contributors set it apart from many edited volumes. Narrative Impact will draw readership from various fields, including sociology, literary studies, and curriculum policy. Providing new explanatory concepts, this book: *is the first account on the psychology of narrative persuasion and brings together the relevant conceptualizations from within various sectors of psychology together with the major issues that concern cognate disciplines outside of psychology; *focuses on understanding the mechanisms that underlie the power of public narratives to achieve broad historical and social changes; *offers breakthroughs to the future: the role of \"presence\" in virtual reality narratives; the role of \"zines\" in females\\' fash'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Critical Discourse Analysis, The Critical Study of Language', 'abstract': 'Bringing together papers written by Norman Fairclough over a 25 year period, Critical Discourse Analysis represents a comprehensive and important contribution to the development of this popular field.

Research is thus the foundation for knowledge. It produces evidence and informs actions that can provide wider benefit to a society. The knowledge that researchers cultivate from a piece of research can be adopted for social and health programs that can improve the health and well-being of the individuals, their communities and the societies in which they live. As we have witnessed in all corners of the globe, research has become an endeavor that most of us in the health and social sciences cannot avoid. This Handbook is conceived to provide the foundation to readers who wish to embark on a research project in order to form knowledge that they need. The Handbook comprises four main sections: Traditional research methods sciences; Innovative research methods; Doing cross-cultural research; and Sensitive research methodology and approach. This Handbook attests to the diversity and richness of research methods in the health and social sciences. It will benefit many readers, particularly students and researchers who undertake research in health and social science areas. It is also valuable for the training needs of postgraduate students who wish to undertake research in cross-cultural settings, with special groups of people, as it provides essential knowledge not only on the methods of data collection but also salient issues that they need to know if they wish to succeed in their research endeavors.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Reframing Public Policy', 'abstract': 'Abstract In recent years a set of new ‘postempiricist’ approaches to public policy, drawing on discursive analysis and participatory deliberative practices, have come to challenge the dominant technocratic, empiricist models in policy analysis. In this book, Frank Fischer brings together this work for the first time and critically examines its implications for the field of public policy studies. He describes the theoretical, methodological and political dimensions of this emerging approach to policy research. The book includes a discussion of the social construction of policy problems, the role of interpretation and narrative analysis in policy inquiry, the dialectics of policy argumentation, and the uses of participatory policy analysis. After an introductory chapter, ten further chapters are arranged in four parts: Part I, Public Policy and the Discursive Construction of Reality (two chapters), introduces the re-emergence of interest in ideas and discourse. It then turns to the postempiricist or constructionist view of social reality, presenting public policy as a discursive construct that turns on multiple interpretations. Part II, Public Policy as Discursive Politics (two chapters), examines more specifically the nature of discursive politics and discourse theory and illustrates through a particular disciplinary debate the theoretical, methodological, and political implications of such a conceptual reframing of policy inquiry. Part III, Discursive Policy Inquiry: Resituating Empirical Analysis (four chapters), offers a postempiricist methodology for policy inquiry based on the logic of practical discourse, and explores specific methodological perspectives pertinent to such an orientation, in particular the role of interpretation in policy analysis, narrative policy analysis, and the dialectics of policy argumentation. Part IV, Deliberative Governance (two chapters), discusses the participatory implications of such a method and the role of the policy analyst as facilitator of citizen deliberation .'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Qualitative Organizational Research: Core Methods and Current Challenges', 'abstract': 'Electronic Inspection Copy available for instructors here This comprehensive text brings together in one volume both consideration of the core methods available for undertaking qualitative data collection and analysis, and discussion of common challenges faced by all researchers in conducting qualitative research.

    "current_research_landscape": "The research cluster is centrally focused on the intersection of communication research, critical language awareness, and discourse analysis applied within digital transformations of organizations and specifically the information technology industry. The core problem is how large language models (LLMs), as generative conversational AI tools, can be effectively integrated for real-time conversational interfaces in healthcare settings, addressing challenges in communication, knowledge accuracy, and organizational change. Dominant methods are qualitative and critical discourse analysis, ethnographic approaches, narrative analysis, and communication research methodologies, supported by exploratory frameworks on digital transformation and media studies. This reflects a paradigm that combines linguistic, sociotechnical, and organizational perspectives to understand and implement conversational AI in healthcare.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps include insufficient exploration of ethical, linguistic biases, and transparency issues inherent in LLM-driven conversational AI, particularly in healthcare contexts. The limitations highlighted in foundational works point to challenges in assessing accuracy, mitigating misinformation, and understanding the human-AI interaction balance. The bridge nodes emphasizing 'communication research' and 'media studies' show limited integration between discourse analytic insights and practical IT implementations within healthcare. Additionally, current research underutilizes methods for systematically evaluating the digital transformation processes in healthcare organizations when introducing such AI tools.\n\nExternally, the global GPS analysis reveals overlooked cross-disciplinary connections: for instance, the link between 'critical study of language' and 'information technology industry' with co-concepts like 'health information systems', 'electronic health records', and 'AI-generated content' is underexplored locally. Similarly, the pairing of 'Reader's Guide themes' and 'critical study of language' connects to health professions education and implementation of electronic health records, suggesting a vital opportunity for embedding LLMs into clinician training and patient communication tools. These hidden bridges indicate that integrating educational methodologies and health informatics frameworks can address existing gaps in real-time conversational AI's efficacy and safety in healthcare environments.",
