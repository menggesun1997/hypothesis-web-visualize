    "title": "Dynamic Perplexity Metrics Incorporating Discourse Moves in Digital Health Communities",
    "Problem_Statement": "Static perplexity metrics fail to capture discourse evolution and social dynamics within fast-changing digital health spaces, limiting LLM intrinsic evaluation relevance.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap of insufficient integration of emergent digital data streams and discourse moves into computational metrics, responding to Opportunity 1’s call for context-aware evaluation reflecting real-world social dynamics.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a dynamic perplexity measurement framework where perplexity is computed over evolving discourse states modeled as latent variables. The model segments dialogues by identified discourse moves and adjusts perplexity weights based on discourse progression stages (inquiry, elaboration, support). This captures not just raw likelihood but social discourse evolution.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Gather temporal dialogue datasets from digital health forums.\n2. Segment conversations by discourse move types.\n3. Develop a latent discourse state model.\n4. Compute dynamic perplexity adjusted by discourse states.\n5. Compare with traditional perplexity measures.\n6. Correlate dynamic perplexity with measures of social engagement and helpfulness.\n7. Test generalization across health topics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Conversation thread starting with \"I’m worried about side effects of medication.\"\nExpected Output: Dynamic perplexity scores drop as conversation transitions into supportive and informative moves, reflecting adaptive model understanding aligned with discourse.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If latent state modeling is complex, try category-wise perplexity weighting using pre-annotated discourse segments. Evaluate ease-of-implementation tradeoffs."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section would benefit from a clearer and more detailed explanation of the latent discourse state model. Currently, the dynamics of how discourse moves are integrated into the perplexity computation and the exact modeling choices (e.g., the nature of latent variables, transition dynamics between discourse states) are under-specified. Providing formal definitions or illustrative algorithmic steps would improve clarity and strengthen soundness by making the mechanism more transparent and reproducible, reducing ambiguity about how discourse progression modulates perplexity weights in practice. This is crucial to convincingly argue the dynamic perplexity metric's validity beyond a conceptual level and to facilitate implementation by others in the community. Consider adding mathematical formulations or pseudo-code to concretize the framework design and assumptions underpinning discourse state evolution modeling in digital health dialogues, as well as how these states translate to perplexity adjustments at each stage of the conversation progression (inquiry, elaboration, support). This would greatly improve reviewer and audience confidence in the technical soundness of the proposal's core innovation (Proposed_Method). Also, explicitly discuss how this modeling differs or improves over existing perplexity and discourse analysis approaches in the literature to better establish novelty and soundness simultaneously, addressing the NOV-COMPETITIVE context noted in the initial assessment.

          "feedback_content": "Given the competitive novelty rating and domain specificity, integrating insights from the broader field of Biomedical and Health Informatics could dramatically enhance both the impact and novelty of this work. Specifically, the authors could leverage electronic health records (EHR) or structured clinical notes as auxiliary data to inform the latent discourse state modeling, grounding discourse moves not just linguistically but also clinically. This integration could enable dynamic perplexity metrics that are sensitive to medically relevant discourse progression patterns, increasing the metric’s relevance and utility for digital health stakeholders such as clinicians, patients, and health informatics systems. Furthermore, such an integration aligns well with the motivation to incorporate emergent digital data streams and social dynamics, grounding social discourse evolution in concrete biomedical context. This would broaden the impact beyond informal health forums to clinical decision support or patient engagement monitoring systems, thus pushing the boundary of current perplexity evaluation work in health NLP. Consider collaborations or data partnerships with Biomedical Informatics groups or use publicly available health dialogue corpora linked with clinical metadata as testbeds. Additionally, connecting to recommender systems concepts could further motivate potential downstream applications, e.g., personalized content recommendation informed by dynamic discourse states.
