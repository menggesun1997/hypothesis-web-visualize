    "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of probing tools that explicitly test how LLM embeddings encode normative ethical values and rights concepts, hindering reliable assessment of social responsibility in representations.",
    "Motivation": "This idea directly confronts the external gap linking 'rights concepts' and 'machine learning' by developing specialized probes derived from normative semantic theories, a novel research direction for embedding explainability and fairness.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a set of embedding probes based on normative ethical lexicons and semantic features indicative of rights and value concepts. Implement multi-dimensional probes that assess embedding sensitivity to normative contrasts (e.g., freedom vs. restriction). Use these probes to map and visualize normative semantic subspaces within embedding geometries quantitatively.",

Develop multi-dimensional probing models sensitive to normative variation.\n4. Visualize normative semantic embeddings subspaces.\n5. Evaluate probe consistency across models and training stages.\n6. Correlate results with fairness and bias assessment benchmarks.\n7. Deploy explainability dashboards for stakeholder auditing.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Words 'justice', 'discrimination', 'freedom'.\nExpected Output: Probes reveal coherent and interpretable normative semantic vectors indicating model alignment with ethical concept relations.",

        "title": "NormativeSemanticEmbedding Probes: Empirical Foundations and Pilot Validation for Ethical Value Encoding in LLM Spaces",
        "Problem_Statement": "While large language models (LLMs) generate embeddings that capture rich semantic information, the assumption that normative ethical values and rights concepts are meaningfully and consistently encoded within these embeddings remains unvalidated. Without empirical grounding, interpreting embedding geometries as reflecting normative ethical reasoning risks misrepresentation and unreliable fairness assessments. This proposal addresses this foundational gap by first rigorously assessing the representational fidelity and stability of normative ethical concepts in LLM embeddings before extensive probe development. We also examine alignment with ethical theories to ensure the legitimacy of using embedding-based normative probes in social responsibility evaluations.",
        "Motivation": "Current research lacks systematic, empirically validated methods to reliably measure how LLM embeddings encode complex, abstract social concepts like rights and ethics, limiting explainability and fairness auditing. Prior work primarily focuses on statistical or linguistic patterns but insufficiently connects these with normative semantic content grounded in ethical theory. Our approach innovates by explicitly validating the embedding representation of normative concepts via pilot studies, followed by the design of multi-dimensional probes informed by normative semantics and guided by measures like the Davies-Bouldin and Calinski-Harabasz indices for cluster validity. Incorporating insights from civil rights laws and legal frameworks, this research pioneers a theoretically informed, empirically substantiated normative semantic probing methodology with significant implications for fairness and responsible AI governance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "The method unfolds in two phases: (1) Empirical validation of embedding representation of normative ethics concepts — selecting representative keywords drawn from normative ethical lexicons, US civil rights laws, and legal frameworks; extracting embeddings from multiple LLMs; and assessing conceptual alignment with normative theory through clustering and stability metrics (e.g., Davies-Bouldin and Calinski-Harabasz indices). This phase integrates language-based tasks and embedding similarity analyses to quantify coherence and robustness of normative semantic subspaces. (2) Development of refined multi-dimensional normative semantic probes based on results from phase one. These probes leverage deep generative models to capture nuanced normative contrasts (e.g., freedom vs. restriction) and allow visualization of normative semantic subspaces. Throughout, we iteratively refine lexicons in expert collaboration with legal scholars and ethicists, defining clear expert criteria and engagement protocols. Correlations between probe outputs and established fairness and bias benchmarks will be carefully operationalized and validated to ensure meaningful interpretability. This dual-phase approach balances theoretical rigor, empirical grounding, and practical feasibility, substantially advancing normative semantic embedding explainability beyond existing methods.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Define scope and engage with legal and ethical experts through structured workshops and surveys to construct and validate a normative ethical lexicon, establishing roles, quality control criteria, and inclusion thresholds to ensure rigor.\n2. Extract embeddings from selected LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, PaLM) for normative keywords and related constructs.\n3. Conduct pilot analyses employing clustering methods and compute Davies-Bouldin and Calinski-Harabasz indices to empirically assess embedding stability and normative conceptual alignment.\n4. Based on pilot outcomes, refine lexicons and select high-fidelity concepts for probe design.\n5. Develop multi-dimensional normative semantic probes using deep generative modeling techniques to capture normative contrasts, ensuring probes are sensitive and discriminative — define explicit validation metrics (e.g., classification accuracy, cluster separability) with predetermined thresholds.\n6. Perform consistency evaluations across different models and training stages at small scale to verify robustness.\n7. Explore correlation of probe outputs with fairness and bias benchmarks, carefully operationalizing normative dimensions to account for measurement gaps.\n8. Scope dashboard development as a prototype demonstration for stakeholder auditing, focusing on explainability features without overextension.\n9. Documentation of methodology and evaluation results to guide future full-scale deployments.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Words such as 'justice', 'discrimination', 'freedom', and legal terms sourced from US civil rights legislation e.g., 'due process', 'equal protection'.\nExpected Output: Pilot study results showing coherent, stable normative semantic clusters with favorable Davies-Bouldin and Calinski-Harabasz scores indicating meaningful embedding representation; multi-dimensional probes reveal interpretable normative contrasts aligning with ethical theory and legal frameworks; correlations with bias assessment metrics transparently reported with clear operational definitions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If normative embeddings exhibit low stability or weak alignment in pilot studies, we will iteratively refine lexicons in collaboration with experts, prioritize behavioral probing approaches that analyze model-generated normative judgments in language-based tasks, and incorporate synthetic data augmentation with deep generative models to enhance representation. Should correlations with fairness benchmarks prove tenuous, methods will focus on explainability and qualitative audit tools rather than quantitative metrics, with dashboard deployment scoped as a future extension."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that normative ethical values and rights concepts can be meaningfully and consistently encoded in LLM embeddings and quantitatively probed using semantic lexicons. However, embeddings primarily reflect statistical co-occurrences rather than normative reasoning, which may limit the validity of directly linking normative ethical theories to embedding geometries. It would strengthen the approach to explicitly discuss and empirically validate assumptions about the representational fidelity of these complex social concepts in LLM spaces before extensive probe development. Consider analyzing embedding stability and conceptual alignment with ethical theory using preliminary small-scale studies to ground this assumption firmly before full scale experimentation is pursued. Such validation will improve the soundness of the core premise and mitigate risk of spurious interpretations of probe outputs in downstream fairness analyses or auditing tools. This step is critical because misinterpreting embedding representations could undermine the entire motivation to measure social responsibility in embeddings effectively and reliably, leading to misleading audit reports or fairness assessments. Clarify and justify these foundational assumptions more thoroughly in the proposal to bolster methodological rigor and theoretical coherence in this nascent probing direction. This critique targets the 'Problem_Statement' and 'Proposed_Method' sections where the foundational premises are stated but lack explicit empirical grounding or theoretical nuance regarding embedding semantics vs. normative content encoding limitations.  \n\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan is comprehensive but ambitious, involving multiple complex stages such as lexicon construction with experts, multi-dimensional probe development, and cross-model consistency evaluation. While the plan is scientifically sound in concept, it lacks concrete details ensuring feasibility within typical resource constraints of academic research, notably: 1) The mechanism and criteria for expert collaboration in lexicon development are vague—defining roles, scope, and quality control methods would enhance confidence in this critical step. 2) The plan does not specify validation metrics or thresholds for the probe sensitivity and discriminative power, which are essential for iterative refinement or fallback decisions. 3) The deployment phase (explainability dashboards for auditing) may require significant engineering effort beyond scholarly contribution and might be better scoped as a future work or prototype demonstration. 4) Potential challenges in correlating probe outputs with existing fairness and bias benchmarks (which may not directly measure normative concept encoding) need addressing—establishing clear operationalizations and justification for such correlations will help feasibility. To strengthen feasibility, it is recommended to prioritize early-stage pilot experiments focusing on probe development and small-scale consistency checks before full visualization and deployment. Additionally, clarifying resource requirements, expert engagement models, and evaluation protocols will greatly improve the practical tractability of the plan, reducing risk of overextension or stagnation. This critique targets the 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' section, urging a tighter, more detailed operationalization of key experimental steps to ensure the project can be delivered successfully within standard research timelines and resource limits."
