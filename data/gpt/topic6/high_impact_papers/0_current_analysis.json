Reaching for the human frontier, robotics is vigorously engaged in the growing challenges of new emerging domains. Interacting, exploring, and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly touch people and their lives. The credible prospect of practical robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics as a modern scientific discipline. The ongoing vibrant expansion and strong growth of the field during the last decade has fueled this second edition of the Springer Handbook of Robotics. The first edition of the handbook soon became a landmark in robotics publishing and won the American Association of Publishers PROSE Award for Excellence in Physical Sciences & Mathematics as well as the organization’s Award for Engineering & Technology. The second edition of the handbook, edited by two internationally renowned scientists with the support of an outstanding team of seven part editors and more than 200 authors, continues to be an authoritative reference for robotics researchers, newcomers to the field, and scholars from related disciplines. The contents have been restructured to achieve four main objectives: the enlargement of foundational topics for robotics, the enlightenment of design of various types of robotic systems, the extension of the treatment on robots moving in the environment, and the enrichment of advanced robotics applications. Further to an extensive update, fifteen new chapters have been introduced on emerging topics, and a new generation of authors have joined the handbook’s team. A novel addition to the second edition is a comprehensive collection of multimedia references to more than 700 videos, which bring valuable insight into the contents. The videos can be viewed directly augmented into the text with a smartphone or tablet using a unique and specially designed app.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology', 'abstract': 'Archaeology – the study of human cultures through the analysis and interpretation of artefacts and material remains – continues to captivate and engage people on a local and global level. Internationally celebrated heritage sites such as the pyramids—both Egyptian and Mayan—Lascaux caves, and the statues of Easter Island provide insights into our ancestors and their actions and motivation. But there is much more to archaeology than famous sites. Ask any archaeologist about their job and they will touch on archaeological theory, chemistry, geology, history, classical studies, museum studies, ethical practice, and survey methods, along with the analysis and interpretation of artefacts and sites. Archaeology is a much broader subject than its public image and branches into many other fields in the social and physical sciences. This multi-volume work provides a comprehensive and systematic coverage of archaeology that is unprecedented, not only in terms of the use of multi-media,but also in terms of content. It encompasses the breadth of the subject along with key aspects that are tapped from other disciplines. It includes all time periods and regions of the world and all stages of human development. Mostly importantly, this encyclopedia includes the knowledge of leading scholars from around the world. The entries in this encyclopedia range from succinct summaries of specific sites and the scientific aspects of archaeological enquiry to detailed discussions of archaeological concepts, theories and methods, and from investigations into the social, ethical and political dimensions of archaeological practice to biographies of leading archaeologists from throughout the world. The different forms of archaeology are explored, along with the techniques used for each and the challenges, concerns and issues that face archaeologists today. The Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology has two outstanding innovations. The first is that scholars were able to submit entries in their own language. Over 300,000 words have been translated from French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Japanese, Turkish and Russian. Many of these entries are by scholars who are publishing in English for the first time. This compendium is both a print reference and an online reference work. The encyclopedia’s second major innovation is that it harnesses the capabilities of an online environment, enhancing both the presentation and dissemination of information. Most particularly, the continuous updating allowed by an online environment should ensure that the Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology is a definitive reference work for archaeology and archaeologists.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'New Horizons for a Data-Driven Economy, A Roadmap for Usage and Exploitation of Big Data in Europe', 'abstract': 'In this book readers will find technological discussions on the existing and emerging technologies across the different stages of the big data value chain. They will learn about legal aspects of big data, the social impact, and about education needs and requirements. And they will discover the business perspective and how big data technology can be exploited to deliver value within different sectors of the economy. The book is structured in four parts: Part I “The Big Data Opportunity” explores the value potential of big data with a particular focus on the European context. It also describes the legal, business and social dimensions that need to be addressed, and briefly introduces the European Commission’s BIG project. Part II “The Big Data Value Chain” details the complete big data lifecycle from a technical point of view, ranging from data acquisition, analysis, curation and storage, to data usage and exploitation. Next, Part III “Usage and Exploitation of Big Data” illustrates the value creation possibilities of big data applications in various sectors, including industry, healthcare, finance, energy, media and public services. Finally, Part IV “A Roadmap for Big Data Research” identifies and prioritizes the cross-sectorial requirements for big data research, and outlines the most urgent and challenging technological, economic, political and societal issues for big data in Europe. This compendium summarizes more than two years of work performed by a leading group of major European research centers and industries in the context of the BIG project. It brings together research findings, forecasts and estimates related to this challenging technological context that is becoming the major axis of the new digitally transformed business environment.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models', 'abstract': 'AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., BERT,\\nDALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a\\nwide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to\\nunderscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report\\nprovides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation\\nmodels, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics,\\nreasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model\\narchitectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation,\\ntheory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal\\nimpact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and\\nethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep\\nlearning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent\\ncapabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes\\nhomogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution,\\nas the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models\\ndownstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models,\\nwe currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and\\nwhat they are even capable of due to their emergent properties.

We present Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) to\\nimprove the transparency of language models. First, we taxonomize the vast\\nspace of potential scenarios (i.e. use cases) and metrics (i.e. desiderata)\\nthat are of interest for LMs. Then we select a broad subset based on coverage\\nand feasibility, noting what's missing or underrepresented (e.g. question\\nanswering for neglected English dialects, metrics for trustworthiness). Second,\\nwe adopt a multi-metric approach: We measure 7 metrics (accuracy, calibration,\\nrobustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency) for each of 16 core\\nscenarios when possible (87.5% of the time). This ensures metrics beyond\\naccuracy don't fall to the wayside, and that trade-offs are clearly exposed. We\\nalso perform 7 targeted evaluations, based on 26 targeted scenarios, to analyze\\nspecific aspects (e.g. reasoning, disinformation). Third, we conduct a\\nlarge-scale evaluation of 30 prominent language models (spanning open,\\nlimited-access, and closed models) on all 42 scenarios, 21 of which were not\\npreviously used in mainstream LM evaluation. Prior to HELM, models on average\\nwere evaluated on just 17.9% of the core HELM scenarios, with some prominent\\nmodels not sharing a single scenario in common. We improve this to 96.0%: now\\nall 30 models have been densely benchmarked on the same core scenarios and\\nmetrics under standardized conditions. Our evaluation surfaces 25 top-level\\nfindings. For full transparency, we release all raw model prompts and\\ncompletions publicly for further analysis, as well as a general modular\\ntoolkit.

    "title": "Research Landscape Map on Intrinsic Benchmarking of LLMs via Language Understanding Probes",
    "current_research_landscape": "The foundational literature illustrates a diverse but somewhat indirectly related set of high-impact works encompassing robotics, archaeology, computational intelligence, and large language model (LLM) evaluation. Central to the local knowledge skeleton are concepts such as interpretation of artifacts, archaeological theory and practice, and advanced robotic applications. These center around understanding and analyzing human culture through material remains, combined with state-of-the-art robotics research focused on developing practical, interactive robots. While robotics is emphasized as an advanced, practically applied field, archaeology is captured as a multi-disciplinary study employing systematic enquires, often supported by encyclopedic knowledge bases acting as online references. The dominant paradigms involve combining domain-specific theoretical frameworks (archaeological theory, concepts) with practical technologies (robot development, robotics applications) and comprehensive, multi-metric evaluation frameworks as seen in language models (e.g., HELM). This suggests the research cluster aims to bridge theory, rich domain knowledge, and practical system evaluation and deployment, which constitutes the intrinsic benchmarking problem under investigation.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: The critical bridge node 'interpretation of artifacts' connects archaeological theory and robotics, yet current literature shows limited integration of advanced robotics or computational intelligence approaches directly with cultural artifact interpretation. Additionally, foundational papers on LLM evaluation reveal a broad yet fragmented approach with notable underrepresented scenarios (e.g., trustworthiness, less common dialects) and lack a cohesive understanding of emergent properties and failure modes of foundation models. This highlights gaps in comprehensive intrinsic benchmarking methods that deeply understand model internal representations and reasoning capabilities beyond surface performance metrics. External/Novel Gaps: From the global context, a notable hidden bridge exists between 'archaeological theory' and 'practical robots' linked to categories such as data management, computing sciences, and engineering. The co-concepts include multi-modal sensor fusion, self-supervised learning, deep learning, and autonomous vehicles which are largely absent from the local literature. This suggests an overlooked cross-disciplinary opportunity to leverage state-of-the-art autonomous robotic sensing, learning, and fusion technologies for richer artifact interpretation and data acquisition in archaeology. Analogously, these advances could inspire novel intrinsic evaluation probes in LLMs, probing model understanding by linking multi-modal contextual data and socio-cognitive abilities drawn from material cultural analogs and ritual deposits. Hence, integrating advanced machine learning and robotics-driven sensing with language understanding benchmarking remains unexplored within the current corpus.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate multi-modal sensor fusion and self-supervised learning techniques (from Global Hidden Bridges) with archaeological theory frameworks (Local Thematic Island) to develop robotic systems capable of autonomous, context-rich artifact interpretation. This would address the internal gap in comprehensive interpretation methodologies and bring practical robots closer to supporting intrinsic benchmarking of cultural data-based knowledge representations.\n\nOpportunity 2: Leverage emergent foundation model properties identified in LLM evaluations (HELM and related works) combined with robotics-driven data acquisition methods to form new language understanding probes that simulate socio-cognitive and cultural context grounding. This fusion tackles the critical gap of underrepresented trustworthiness and reasoning evaluation scenarios in language models by rooting probes in embodied and historical knowledge analogues.\n\nOpportunity 3: Develop an interdisciplinary intrinsic benchmarking framework combining deep learning-enabled autonomous robotic sensing for archaeological materials with multi-volume, continuously updated online encyclopedic references. This would create a living benchmark environment reflecting evolving cultural and linguistic insights, thus overcoming current limitations in static or narrowly scoped language model evaluations and providing enriched multi-domain interpretability metrics."
