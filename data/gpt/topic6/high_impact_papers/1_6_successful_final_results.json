    "Problem_Statement": "Self-consistency metrics do not currently account for the social impact or benefit of model outputs in online community settings, limiting evaluations of real-world value.",
    "Motivation": "By integrating social support and community care discourse insights directly into self-consistency metrics, this idea addresses the hidden bridge between online social sciences and AI metrics, tackling a novel external gap.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Augment standard self-consistency computation by weighting output agreement scores with estimated social impact measures derived from community feedback signals, such as upvotes, replies indicating support, or linguistic markers of social value. Use a supervised model to learn optimal social impact weights. This produces a socially meaningful self-consistency metric reflecting both agreement and social benefit.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Obtain datasets from online forums with community feedback annotations.\n2. Extract social impact features from feedback signals and linguistic markers.\n3. Fine-tune model to predict social impact scores.\n4. Combine with standard self-consistency calculations.\n5. Benchmark against unweighted self-consistency.\n6. Validate correlation with human social impact evaluations.\n7. Conduct robustness tests across domain shifts.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"How can I find support when feeling lonely?\"\nExpected Output: Responses consistently promoting community care and yielding high social feedback produce higher social impact-weighted self-consistency scores than generic advice.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If feedback signals are sparse, use proxy features such as sentiment or community recognition badges. Employ unsupervised clustering to detect socially positive responses as fallback impact estimators."

        "title": "Social Impact-Weighted Self-Consistency Metrics for LLM Evaluation Using Validated Community Support Dynamics in Mental Health Discourse",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current self-consistency metrics for large language models (LLMs) inadequately capture the true social impact of model-generated responses in online community settings, particularly in sensitive domains such as mental health support, where community feedback signals like upvotes, replies, and linguistic markers may be noisy, biased, or reflect popularity instead of genuine social benefit. Without rigorous validation that these signals reliably correspond to real-world positive outcomes, evaluations risk misleading conclusions about social value.",
        "Motivation": "This proposal aims to bridge a critical gap by rigorously grounding and validating the use of community feedback signals as proxies for social impact in online support contexts, especially mental health. Unlike prior efforts that incorporate social feedback uncritically, our approach systematically verifies correlations between feedback patterns and expert-annotated social benefit indicators, strengthening the foundational assumptions behind impact-weighted self-consistency metrics. Integrating insights from biomedical and health informatics and involving mental health professionals in evaluation uniquely positions our method to better capture meaningful social value in LLM outputs, advancing evaluation metrics beyond popularity alignment toward substantive social benefit assessment.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-stage framework: First, conduct an extensive empirical validation study to assess the reliability of feedback signals (upvotes, reply patterns, linguistic markers) as proxies for social impact by comparing them against expert (mental health professionals) annotations of social benefit and harm in LLM-generated online support responses. This involves collecting a specialized dataset from mental health forums enriched with granular community feedback and expert evaluations. Next, we develop a supervised model to predict social impact scores based on validated feedback features and refined linguistic markers informed by biomedical informatics standards for patient education and support discourse. This model generates impact-weight weights for self-consistency metrics, adjusting traditional agreement scores to reflect social benefit rather than popularity alone. To address domain variability and data sparsity, we incorporate domain adaptation techniques and fallback strategies utilizing sentiment analysis and community role badges. By emphatically grounding the weighting model on rigorously validated signals and expert input, we ensure a socially meaningful self-consistency metric that better evaluates generative AI outputs' real-world value in online health information and community care.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Collection: Aggregate publicly available datasets from mental health support forums (e.g., Reddit's r/mentalhealth, patient education portals) containing community feedback signals (upvotes, replies, badges).\n2. Expert Annotation: Engage certified mental health professionals to annotate a representative subset of model-generated responses for social impact dimensions (supportiveness, harm reduction, misinformation).\n3. Validation Analysis: Statistically analyze correlations and variance between community feedback signals and expert annotations across multiple communities and topics to verify feedback reliability as social impact proxies.\n4. Feature Engineering: Extract and refine social feedback features and domain-informed linguistic markers following biomedical informatics standards.\n5. Model Training: Train supervised models to predict expert social impact scores from feedback features, incorporating uncertainty estimation and domain adaptation techniques.\n6. Integration: Develop the social impact-weighted self-consistency metric by combining standard agreement scores with learned impact weights.\n7. Benchmarking: Compare the proposed metric against unweighted self-consistency and other baselines using held-out data.\n8. Human Evaluation: Conduct blinded evaluations with mental health professionals assessing metric alignment with perceived social benefit.\n9. Robustness Testing: Test model and metric generalization across domain shifts (different online communities, varying health topics, and diverse demographic groups).\n10. Fallback Evaluation: Validate fallback proxy methods (sentiment, badges, clustering) when feedback signals are sparse or noisy.\n11. Documentation & Reproducibility: Publish datasets, annotation guidelines, and code to facilitate reproducibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: \"I’ve been feeling very isolated lately and don’t know where to turn for help.\"\nExpected Evaluation Outcome: Among generated responses, those consistently encouraging community care and offering empirically supported advice with high expert-rated social benefit and strong validated community feedback receive higher social impact-weighted self-consistency scores than generic or potentially harmful responses. \n\nConversely, generic advice responses with popularity-driven high upvotes but low expert-rated supportiveness should receive lower weights to avoid misleading metric inflation.\n\nTest cases will cover nuanced mental health scenarios including crisis communication, stigma reduction, and patient education to stress test metric sensitivity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If community feedback signals prove insufficiently reliable or sparse for certain domains or subsets, we will deploy unsupervised clustering of responses based on linguistic markers linked to supportiveness, supplemented by sentiment analysis calibrated for mental health contexts. We will also leverage community role badges and participation histories as proxy impact indicators. These fallback features will be empirically validated against expert annotations to the extent possible and integrated with uncertainty-aware weighting to mitigate overreliance. Additionally, domain adaptation models will allow the metric to generalize from richer domains to sparser ones, preserving evaluation validity when direct social feedback data is limited."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that community feedback signals (such as upvotes, replies, and linguistic markers) can be reliably mapped to meaningful social impact is not sufficiently justified. Online feedback can be noisy, biased, or reflect popularity rather than genuine social benefit. The proposal would benefit from a clearer theoretical grounding and empirical evidence that these signals robustly capture socially beneficial outcomes in diverse communities before integrating them as weights into self-consistency metrics. Without this, the validity of the socially weighted metric is questionable, threatening the soundness of the entire framework and downstream conclusions drawn from it. Consider incorporating preliminary analysis or citations that validate the correlation between feedback signals and true social impact in online support settings, especially for sensitive topics like mental health or community care discourse, where feedback may be sparse or influenced by social dynamics unrelated to impact effectiveness. This refinement would strengthen the foundational assumptions and increase confidence in the proposed method’s meaningfulness and applicability in real-world evaluations of LLM outputs in online community contexts, ensuring the metric’s social impact weighting is not conflating engagement/popularity with substantive supportiveness or harm reduction, which are the ultimate targets of impact evaluation here.  This is a critical issue to address before advancing to feasibility and experimental implementation stages in the pipeline described in Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan.  \n\nIn summary: please explicitly verify or better justify that social feedback signals serve as valid proxies of social impact in the target settings, to ensure soundness of the approach and avoid misleading evaluation results caused by noisy or proxy signals that deviate from true social good measures. This can include exploration of variance across communities, topic domains, and types of feedback and how those relate to real-world benefits or harms.  \n\nThis is the highest priority critique to fix for this proposal’s viability at peer review stage, as it underpins the entire rationale for social impact-weighted self-consistency metrics.  \n\n---\nSOU-ASSUMPTION: Problem_Statement & Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "The outlined experiment plan is comprehensive but partially optimistic in pragmatism and clarity of evaluation. Key feasibility challenges arise regarding the availability and suitability of datasets with reliable, granular community feedback annotations for social impact, which are needed to train and validate the weighting model. Many forums or online communities do not provide direct social impact labels, and reliance on proxy signals or noisy feedback may complicate supervised training and benchmarking. \n\nIt is therefore critical to explicitly address data availability and informatics challenges at the start, including a detailed strategy to obtain or construct high-quality annotated datasets, delineate criteria for data inclusion, and justify that the data is representative of the social support dynamics targeted by the metric. Moreover, the plan to \"validate correlation with human social impact evaluations\" requires clearer protocol specification—such as human evaluation design, annotator expertise (mental health professionals?), agreement metrics, and scale—to ensure external validity. \n\nAdditionally, as robustness tests against domain shifts are proposed, the experimental plan must specify which domain shifts (e.g., different types of online communities or health-related topics) will be tested and how domain adaptation techniques might be integrated or required. Without these clarifications, the feasibility and reproducibility of experiments are uncertain.\n\nTo improve, provide a more granular, practical roadmap addressing these potential data and evaluation challenges, including fallback methods as indicated but concretely tied to measurable criteria for success. This helps reviewers and practitioners assess how the complex social impact-weighted metric can be built and validated in practice, rather than remaining conceptual.\n\n\n---\nFEA-EXPERIMENT: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
