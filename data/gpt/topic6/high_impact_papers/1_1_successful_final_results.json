    "title": "Cross-Cultural Intrinsic Evaluation Framework Incorporating Dignity and Psychosocial Distress Metrics",
    "Problem_Statement": "Intrinsic LLM evaluation currently lacks sensitivity towards cultural variations in constructs like dignity and psychosocial distress, limiting fairness and relevance across diverse populations.",
    "Motivation": "The proposal targets the external gap related to underexplored multi-country evaluation frameworks integrating social science insights on dignity and distress, addressing fairness and context-awareness in LLM assessment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a multi-country benchmark portraying culture-specific expressions of dignity and psychosocial distress extracted from regional social media and clinical narratives. Develop evaluation metrics that measure LLM outputs' adherence to culturally nuanced linguistic markers and social norms. Integrate these with perplexity and self-consistency to form a composite, culture-aware intrinsic evaluation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multilingual, multicultural corpora representing dignity and psychosocial distress in at least five distinct cultures.\n2. Collaborate with cultural experts to annotate key semantic and pragmatic markers.\n3. Develop cultural marker detectors.\n4. Evaluate LLM outputs generated on culturally framed prompts using standard intrinsic metrics.\n5. Introduce weighted metrics based on cultural marker alignment.\n6. Compare composite scores with human judgments across cultures.\n7. Analyze disparities and fairness implications.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input (Japanese): \"Describe ways to respectfully decline an invitation that may cause psychosocial distress.\"\nExpected Output: Responses exhibiting culturally appropriate honorifics and indirect communication receive higher composite scores, reflecting cultural dignity norms alongside perplexity and consistency.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cultural marker detection is unreliable, fallback on unsupervised clustering to identify language style patterns by culture. Utilize crowd-sourced human evaluations to supplement metric validation."

        "title": "Dynamic Cross-Cultural Intrinsic Evaluation Framework Integrating Human-Computer Interaction and Evolving Cultural Markers for Fairness-Aware LLM Assessment",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic evaluation of large language models (LLMs) insufficiently accounts for culturally nuanced constructs such as dignity and psychosocial distress, which vary significantly across diverse populations. Existing approaches lack robust mechanisms to detect and measure these constructs reliably across multiple languages and dialects, limiting fairness, validity, and relevance in global LLM assessment.",
        "Motivation": "While prior works in fairness and cultural-aware evaluation frameworks exist, this proposal innovates by explicitly incorporating human-computer interaction theory and cultural communication principles to deepen cross-cultural interpretability and user alignment. By embedding real-world, multicultural HCI scenarios involving mental health and the coexistence of cultures, and leveraging frameworks from digital media development for dynamic evolution of cultural markers, we aim to create a scalable, adaptive, and context-rich intrinsic evaluation framework that bridges theoretical insights with practical applicability. This positions our work as a uniquely multidisciplinary and ethically aligned advancement, addressing gaps in operationalizing subjective psychosocial constructs within automated, culture-aware LLM assessment metrics.",
        "Proposed_Method": "1) Construct a continuously updated, multi-country benchmark corpus capturing culture-specific expressions of dignity and psychosocial distress sourced from social media, clinical narratives, and interactive real-world HCI scenarios reflecting cultural coexistence and mental health contexts. 2) Collaborate closely with cultural experts and HCI researchers throughout iterative data collection, annotation, and validation cycles to ensure cultural representativeness, reduce bias, and enhance semantic-pragmatic marker accuracy across languages and dialects. 3) Develop semi-supervised learning models to detect nuanced cultural markers, combining expert annotations with machine-inferred patterns to balance scalability and quality. 4) Embed digital media development frameworks to dynamically update cultural markers in response to evolving social norms and global media trends. 5) Design evaluation metrics integrating these markers with traditional perplexity and self-consistency measures, weighted by cultural relevance and aligned with HCI-informed interpretability. 6) Deploy evaluation tasks simulating multicultural human-computer interactions involving mental health communication to validate user-aligned fairness and contextual accuracy. This combination ensures robustness, adaptability, and deep interpretability, differentiating our framework from existing methods.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Initiate extensive multilingual, multicultural data collection capturing dignity and psychosocial distress expressions from diverse sources including social media, clinical texts, and HCI-based interaction simulations representing at least five culturally distinct populations. 2. Establish iterative annotation cycles engaging cultural and HCI experts to develop and refine semantic and pragmatic cultural markers, integrating ongoing feedback to mitigate annotation bias and ensure cross-cultural validity. 3. Implement a semi-supervised learning framework leveraging expert annotations and unlabeled data to train cultural marker detectors, validating model outputs with expert-in-the-loop verification to ensure reliability and reproducibility. 4. Integrate a digital media development pipeline to monitor and incorporate emerging cultural and normative shifts into marker definitions and detection models, enabling dynamic framework evolution. 5. Generate LLM outputs on culturally grounded, HCI-informed prompts reflecting real-world mental health and multicultural scenarios. 6. Evaluate outputs using composite metrics combining traditional language model evaluation (perplexity, self-consistency) and weighted cultural marker alignment scores. 7. Conduct human evaluation studies with culturally diverse participants aligned with HCI principles to assess fairness, interpretability, and usability of the composite metric. 8. Analyze disparities and feedback to iteratively enhance model calibration and underlying cultural markers, ensuring ethical and trustworthy fairness-aware assessment across cultural boundaries.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input (Japanese): \"Describe ways to respectfully decline an invitation that may cause psychosocial distress in a mixed-culture business meeting scenario.\"\nExpected Output: Responses exhibiting culturally appropriate honorific use, indirect communication styles, and sensitivity towards psychosocial distress are scored higher. The evaluation also examines alignment with human-computer interaction norms on respectful refusal, emphasizing coexistence of differing cultural expectations.\n\nInput (Brazilian Portuguese): \"Explain comforting phrases to a colleague experiencing work-related anxiety during a multicultural digital collaboration.\"\nExpected Output: Outputs weighted higher when containing culturally resonant expressions of empathy validated by local cultural experts and reflecting contemporary digital media influences on mental health communication.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should cultural marker detection via semi-supervised models face practical constraints, we will pivot to a structured semi-automated approach where expert-curated seed markers guide iterative model refinement on unlabeled data with active expert validation to maintain quality and reproducibility. The framework will incorporate crowdsourced human evaluations limited to expert-verified tasks with enhanced annotation guidelines to reduce noise. Additionally, meta-analyses comparing multiple semi-supervised and expert-driven approaches will inform selection of the most robust and scalable detection pipelines, ensuring that fallback steps still meet standards of trustworthiness and effective cultural nuance capture."

The plan should incorporate iterative validation loops with cultural experts throughout data collection and annotation phases to mitigate annotation bias and ensure cultural representativeness. Additionally, the fallback plan relying on unsupervised clustering and crowdsourced evaluations might introduce noise and reduce reproducibility; a more structured semi-supervised learning framework should be considered to balance scalability and quality. Clarifying these methodological safeguards and resource requirements will enhance feasibility confidence and experimental robustness in a multilingual multicultural setting involving sensitive psychosocial constructs, which are inherently subjective and nuanced to operationalize within automated metrics. This is critical for trustworthiness and eventual adoption of the composite evaluation metrics in fairness-aware LLM assessment contexts (Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan)."

For instance, designing evaluation tasks or prompts that reflect real-world human-computer interaction scenarios involving the coexistence of cultures and mental health problems could bridge theoretical and practical gaps. Furthermore, leveraging digital media development frameworks might facilitate dynamic updating of cultural markers to reflect evolving social norms and media trends globally. This integration would serve to broaden impact, differentiate the contribution, and foster adoption by the global academic community, aligning the framework with multi-disciplinary advances and emerging ethical AI standards (Motivation, Proposed_Method)."
