    "title": "Cross-Country Comparative Framework Linking Psychosocial Distress Expression and LLM Intrinsic Evaluation",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of frameworks to evaluate intrinsic LLM performance on culturally diverse expressions of psychosocial distress, challenging model fairness and applicability across countries.",
    "Motivation": "This idea leverages the 'groups of countries' hidden bridge by creating cross-country evaluation frameworks combining social sciences insight with LLM intrinsic metrics, filling an important external gap regarding diversity sensitivity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create parallel corpora of psychosocial distress expressions from multiple countries and languages. Design intrinsic metrics that assess LLM responses for alignment with local linguistic and cultural norms of distress expression by integrating perplexity and self-consistency with cultural norm detectors. Perform cross-country comparative benchmarking to identify performance disparities and guide localization efforts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect and preprocess distress narratives from diverse countries' social media and clinical texts.\n2. Annotate cultural linguistic features and expression norms.\n3. Train cultural norm detectors.\n4. Generate LLM outputs for distress prompts.\n5. Compute integrated intrinsic metrics combining perplexity, consistency, and cultural alignment.\n6. Compare metrics cross-country.\n7. Publish benchmark and fairness analysis reports.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input (Brazilian Portuguese): A textual narrative expressing social exclusion and anxiety.\nExpected Output: Properly localized LLM outputs scored higher by the intrinsic framework for exhibiting culturally consonant phrasing and empathy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cross-language data scarcity arises, focus on high-resource countries first and apply domain adaptation techniques. If cultural norm detector underperforms, replace with human-in-the-loop evaluations."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while comprehensive, lacks clarity on how cultural norm detectors will be trained and validated, especially considering the complexity and variability of psychosocial distress expressions across different languages and cultures. The plan should explicitly address strategies for ensuring high-quality, culturally sensitive annotations, the criteria for cultural norm detector performance, and contingency plans beyond human-in-the-loop in case of poor detector generalization. Additionally, scalability concerns arise given the requirement for data from multiple countries—details on sourcing, data privacy, and ethical considerations need further bolstering to establish practical feasibility at scale and compliance with data protection norms across jurisdictions. Expanding on these will strengthen confidence in the study's operational viability and reproducibility in a highly challenging domain and multilingual context, which is critical given the competitive nature of this research area and data resource constraints noted in the fallback plan (e.g., domain adaptation). Revising the Experiment_Plan accordingly is essential for solid feasibility assessment and successful execution of this cross-cultural LLM evaluation framework.  This includes specifying annotation protocols, sampling strategies, and resource allocation for diverse data sources and multilingual norm detector development and evaluation pipelines, thus reducing ambiguity and enhancing practical clarity for implementation."

          "feedback_content": "Given the competitive novelty rating (NOV-COMPETITIVE) and the focus on psychosocial distress expression—an area deeply linked to mental health care—the idea could substantially enhance impact and distinctiveness by integrating direct collaboration or data-sharing partnerships with international mental health care organizations or platforms. Incorporating clinically validated distress assessment tools or real-world patient-reported outcomes within the evaluation framework could provide robust external validation and deeper clinical relevance. Furthermore, leveraging such partnerships to enrich datasets and to apply findings for improving culturally adapted mental health interventions via LLMs would not only strengthen fairness and applicability claims but also align the framework tightly with global health priorities. This integration can enable bridging between cutting-edge AI fairness research and practical healthcare improvements internationally, thereby broadening innovation scope and increasing societal and academic impact beyond intrinsic evaluation metrics alone."
