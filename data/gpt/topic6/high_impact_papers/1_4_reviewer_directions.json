    "title": "Multimodal Intrinsic Evaluation Merging LLM Perplexity with Social Science-Derived Quality of Life Indicators",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing intrinsic evaluation ignores multimodal social and behavioral indicators relevant to quality of life, reducing context sensitivity of LLM metrics.",
    "Motivation": "This idea synthesizes the multidisciplinary quality-of-life framework with computational perplexity to bridge human-centered evaluation and AI intrinsic metrics by integrating multiple data modalities, addressing internal and external gaps.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multimodal evaluation metric combining LLM-generated text perplexity with features extracted from social science-derived quality of life indicators such as survey results, geographic socio-economic data, and behavioral health metrics relevant to the generated content context. Use a fusion model to output a composite intrinsic evaluation score reflecting both computational and human-centered dimensions.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collate multimodal datasets linking social, geographic, and behavioral indicators to textual data.\n2. Generate LLM text samples contextualized by these indicators.\n3. Extract relevant quality of life features.\n4. Combine perplexity scores with these features using a neural fusion model.\n5. Validate composite scores with human expert assessments.\n6. Analyze improvements over text-only metrics.\n7. Test across diverse demographic and geographic contexts.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt about community mental health services in rural vs. urban areas.\nExpected Output: Composite intrinsic scores reflect lower perplexity and higher social relevance alignment in responses sensitive to quality of life indicators distinctive to each setting.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If full multimodal fusion is infeasible, implement separate stage-wise evaluation and fuse results via rule-based heuristics. Explore transfer learning to compensate for limited multimodal data."

Clarify how these heterogeneous data modalities will be aligned temporally and semantically, how the fusion model will be trained and validated, and how it will preserve the intrinsic meaning of both perplexity scores and social indicators to justify the mechanism's soundness and effectiveness. Providing a concrete model architecture or referencing prior work in multimodal fusion would strengthen this section substantially by demonstrating clear feasibility and reasoning behind the mechanism design.\n\nPrompt to specifically elaborate on the feature extraction methods from the social datasets and the integration techniques for the final composite score to ensure robust and replicable methodology design, addressing potential confounds or biases in multimodal data fusion."

It is necessary to outline contingency plans for dataset limitations, potential domain adaptation, and data sparsity issues. Moreover, the plan should include more explicit evaluation criteria and metrics for assessing compositional score improvements over perplexity alone, including quantitative benchmarks and statistical significance testing against human expert assessments.\n\nConsider expanding the fallback strategy to involve more scalable or modular approaches, such as incremental integration or simulation studies, to ensure feasibility within realistic resource constraints and timelines."
