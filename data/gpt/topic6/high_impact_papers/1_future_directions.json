        "title": "Contextualizing Self-Consistency Metrics with Online Health Discourse Analysis",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic evaluation metrics like self-consistency and perplexity treat model outputs in isolation, lacking sensitivity to social context and discourse dynamics prevalent in online health communities. This inhibits evaluating LLMs' real-world social impact relevance, especially in digital health.",
        "Motivation": "This research addresses the external/novel gap between online spaces and social sciences, particularly integrating discourse moves and digital health concepts with intrinsic LLM evaluation metrics, as identified in the map's hidden bridges. It moves beyond static perplexity to a context-aware evaluation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid intrinsic evaluation metric that augments self-consistency with discourse move recognition modules trained on health-focused online forums. The method extracts discourse features (e.g., question, affirmation, caution) and computes context-conditioned consistency scores reflecting alignment with community norms and social support dynamics. This combines qualitative discourse analysis methodologies from social sciences with computational LLM metrics to generate socially-informed evaluation results.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets from online health forums, Reddit health communities, and digital health Q&A platforms.\n2. Annotate discourse moves using expert social science coding protocols.\n3. Fine-tune discourse move classifiers.\n4. Implement self-consistency evaluation modified to weight responses by discourse move types.\n5. Baseline against standard self-consistency and perplexity.\n6. Evaluate correlations with human social impact assessments and domain expert ratings.\n7. Perform ablation to isolate each component’s contribution.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What are safe treatments for mild anxiety during pregnancy?\" \nExpected Output: Self-consistency scores differ when model answers repeatedly caution and cite social support sources vs. generic medical advice. Higher contextual self-consistency when responses align with discourse moves encouraging community care and respect for psychosocial distress.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If discourse move recognition proves noisy, fallback to simpler sentiment analysis integration. Alternatively, use rule-based lexicons of social support terms as proxies. Conduct user studies to validate metric relevance if computational correlations falter."

        "title": "Cross-Cultural Intrinsic Evaluation Framework Incorporating Dignity and Psychosocial Distress Metrics",
        "Problem_Statement": "Intrinsic LLM evaluation currently lacks sensitivity towards cultural variations in constructs like dignity and psychosocial distress, limiting fairness and relevance across diverse populations.",
        "Motivation": "The proposal targets the external gap related to underexplored multi-country evaluation frameworks integrating social science insights on dignity and distress, addressing fairness and context-awareness in LLM assessment.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a multi-country benchmark portraying culture-specific expressions of dignity and psychosocial distress extracted from regional social media and clinical narratives. Develop evaluation metrics that measure LLM outputs' adherence to culturally nuanced linguistic markers and social norms. Integrate these with perplexity and self-consistency to form a composite, culture-aware intrinsic evaluation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multilingual, multicultural corpora representing dignity and psychosocial distress in at least five distinct cultures.\n2. Collaborate with cultural experts to annotate key semantic and pragmatic markers.\n3. Develop cultural marker detectors.\n4. Evaluate LLM outputs generated on culturally framed prompts using standard intrinsic metrics.\n5. Introduce weighted metrics based on cultural marker alignment.\n6. Compare composite scores with human judgments across cultures.\n7. Analyze disparities and fairness implications.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input (Japanese): \"Describe ways to respectfully decline an invitation that may cause psychosocial distress.\"\nExpected Output: Responses exhibiting culturally appropriate honorifics and indirect communication receive higher composite scores, reflecting cultural dignity norms alongside perplexity and consistency.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If cultural marker detection is unreliable, fallback on unsupervised clustering to identify language style patterns by culture. Utilize crowd-sourced human evaluations to supplement metric validation."

        "title": "Hybrid Qualitative-Computational Framework for LLM Evaluation Grounded in Social Support Constructs",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLM intrinsic evaluation largely ignores qualitative social constructs such as social support, resulting in assessments that lack social grounding and interpretability with respect to human-centered evaluations.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of poor integration between qualitative thematic analyses (digital data types, social support concepts) and computational uncertainty/self-consistency metrics, leveraging interdisciplinary synthesis as per Opportunity 3.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create a framework that transforms qualitative thematic codes of social support from digital communication into computational features. Integrate these with LLM self-consistency measures by weighting uncertainty estimates according to the presence and type of social support expressed. This yields nuanced intrinsic evaluations that reflect human social behavior.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Utilize datasets from online communities annotated for social support (e.g., emotional, informational).\n2. Extract thematic codes using qualitative analysis (SAGE Handbook methods).\n3. Engineer quantitative social support features.\n4. Incorporate features into self-consistency score computation, modulating scores by support presence.\n5. Benchmark against standard intrinsic metrics.\n6. Validate interpretability and alignment with human judgments.\n7. Perform sensitivity analyses.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Feeling overwhelmed by work, what should I do?\"\nExpected Output: LLM responses providing emotional and practical support yield lowered perplexity weighted by social support signaling and higher self-consistency when support is consistently reflected.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If thematic coding is expensive, implement semi-supervised learning to auto-label social support types. Test whether simplified keyword presence can approximate thematic integration."

        "Problem_Statement": "Static perplexity metrics fail to capture discourse evolution and social dynamics within fast-changing digital health spaces, limiting LLM intrinsic evaluation relevance.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap of insufficient integration of emergent digital data streams and discourse moves into computational metrics, responding to Opportunity 1’s call for context-aware evaluation reflecting real-world social dynamics.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a dynamic perplexity measurement framework where perplexity is computed over evolving discourse states modeled as latent variables. The model segments dialogues by identified discourse moves and adjusts perplexity weights based on discourse progression stages (inquiry, elaboration, support). This captures not just raw likelihood but social discourse evolution.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Gather temporal dialogue datasets from digital health forums.\n2. Segment conversations by discourse move types.\n3. Develop a latent discourse state model.\n4. Compute dynamic perplexity adjusted by discourse states.\n5. Compare with traditional perplexity measures.\n6. Correlate dynamic perplexity with measures of social engagement and helpfulness.\n7. Test generalization across health topics.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Conversation thread starting with \"I’m worried about side effects of medication.\"\nExpected Output: Dynamic perplexity scores drop as conversation transitions into supportive and informative moves, reflecting adaptive model understanding aligned with discourse.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If latent state modeling is complex, try category-wise perplexity weighting using pre-annotated discourse segments. Evaluate ease-of-implementation tradeoffs."

        "Problem_Statement": "Existing intrinsic evaluation ignores multimodal social and behavioral indicators relevant to quality of life, reducing context sensitivity of LLM metrics.",
        "Motivation": "This idea synthesizes the multidisciplinary quality-of-life framework with computational perplexity to bridge human-centered evaluation and AI intrinsic metrics by integrating multiple data modalities, addressing internal and external gaps.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multimodal evaluation metric combining LLM-generated text perplexity with features extracted from social science-derived quality of life indicators such as survey results, geographic socio-economic data, and behavioral health metrics relevant to the generated content context. Use a fusion model to output a composite intrinsic evaluation score reflecting both computational and human-centered dimensions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collate multimodal datasets linking social, geographic, and behavioral indicators to textual data.\n2. Generate LLM text samples contextualized by these indicators.\n3. Extract relevant quality of life features.\n4. Combine perplexity scores with these features using a neural fusion model.\n5. Validate composite scores with human expert assessments.\n6. Analyze improvements over text-only metrics.\n7. Test across diverse demographic and geographic contexts.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt about community mental health services in rural vs. urban areas.\nExpected Output: Composite intrinsic scores reflect lower perplexity and higher social relevance alignment in responses sensitive to quality of life indicators distinctive to each setting.",

        "Proposed_Method": "Create parallel corpora of psychosocial distress expressions from multiple countries and languages. Design intrinsic metrics that assess LLM responses for alignment with local linguistic and cultural norms of distress expression by integrating perplexity and self-consistency with cultural norm detectors. Perform cross-country comparative benchmarking to identify performance disparities and guide localization efforts.",
