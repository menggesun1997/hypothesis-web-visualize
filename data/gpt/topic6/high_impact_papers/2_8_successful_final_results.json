        "title": "Explainable Ethical Embedding Space Visualizations for Social Bias Diagnostics with Clinical Narrative and Sensor Data Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current embedding evaluation methods lack explainable visualization tools that accurately map social biases and ethical concerns embedded within large language model (LLM) representations. Furthermore, existing approaches primarily focus on generalized NLP contexts, missing critical application in sensitive domains such as healthcare, where biases in electronic health records (EHRs) and sensor data embeddings can impact clinical decision support and mental health diagnosis fairness.",
        "Motivation": "While previous work has addressed social bias visualization in NLP embeddings, novelty is limited by the narrow domain of application. Our research pioneers the integration of explainable ethical embedding visualizations within both normative semantic analysis and real-world clinical data contexts, including EHR narratives and wearable sensor-based activity recognition. This cross-disciplinary framework uniquely advances interpretability, fairness diagnostics, and ethical transparency in AI applied to healthcare, addressing urgent biases in medical AI and expanding societal impact beyond abstract bias detection. We emphasize rigorous lexicon construction, scalability, and user-centered evaluation to create a practical, reusable tool for ethical bias diagnostics across domains.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We will develop a novel visualization framework combining normative semantic ethical lexicons with embedding analyses from both language models and domain-specific clinical/sensor embeddings. Key components include: (1) construction of culturally-aware, multi-perspective normative semantic lexicons through expert crowdsourcing and automated expansion techniques, ensuring lexicon quality and coverage with transparency metrics; (2) embedding extraction from LLMs, EHR clinical narratives, and wearable sensor data from mental health assessment datasets; (3) constrained dimensionality reduction techniques such as tailored UMAP with domain-informed constraints for bias-sensitive embedding subspace projections; (4) an interactive visual analytics dashboard featuring linked views—embedding neighborhoods, bias clusters, semantic and fairness concept annotations, and guided bias insight tours for maintainable user engagement; (5) integration of interpretability and fairness validation metrics, including quantitative cluster purity, semantic coherence scores, and human-subject user studies with domain experts in AI ethics, clinical informatics, and psychiatry; (6) scalability strategies including batching, approximate nearest neighbor search, and progressive loading to ensure responsiveness with large embeddings; and (7) iterative feedback checkpoints incorporating fallback mechanisms (e.g., natural language summarizations) to enhance usability and explainability. This multi-modal, multi-domain framework distinctly advances beyond standard social bias visualizations by incorporating clinical and sensor data contexts linked to ethical principles in healthcare AI.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Construct robust normative semantic lexicons for key ethical dimensions by combining expert crowdsourcing spanning diverse cultural perspectives and automated lexicon expansion via semantic similarity and validation using lexical coverage and cultural representativeness metrics.  \n2. Collect and preprocess embeddings: extract normative semantic embeddings from LLM outputs, clinical narrative embeddings from de-identified EHR datasets relevant to depression and anxiety (e.g., notes annotated with GAD-7 scores), and temporal embeddings derived from wearable sensor-based human activity recognition related to mental health assessments.  \n3. Apply constrained dimensionality reduction (tailored UMAP with normative semantic and fairness-based constraints) separately to each embedding source, ensuring preservation of ethical semantic structures and bias-relevant variance.  \n4. Develop an interactive visual analytics dashboard integrating multiple linked views, including embedding scatterplots with bias cluster overlays, semantic annotation tooltips referencing the lexicons, and guided tours that scaffold bias exploration and interpretability for diverse users.  \n5. Define and compute quantitative validation metrics for interpretability (e.g., cluster purity aligned with normative dimensions), semantic coherence, and scalability (latency under load).  \n6. Conduct human-subject evaluations with domain experts in AI ethics, clinical informatics, and psychiatry, assessing usability, interpretability, and diagnostic effectiveness via structured protocols and think-aloud sessions.  \n7. Incorporate feedback iteratively, revisiting lexicon refinement, visualization complexity, and interaction design, deploying fallback plans such as natural language summarization anchoring if user testing indicates cognitive overload or confusion.  \n8. Demonstrate framework utility through case studies detecting embedded social biases in gendered occupational terms, racial and ethnic disparities in clinical notes, and bias patterns within sensor-based activity recognition linked to mental health states.  \n9. Document reproducible protocols for lexicon construction, embedding extraction, visualization parameterization, and human evaluation to ensure scientific rigor and community adoption.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Visualization of embeddings for gendered occupational terms extracted from LLM and their counterparts embedded in clinical narrative datasets related to depression assessment.\nExpected Output: Clear bias clusters appear across datasets, revealing consistent and domain-specific biases, with semantic explanations linked to normative ethical lexicons. Users can interactively explore embedding neighborhoods, distinguish bias sources, and receive guided tours clarifying fairness implications.\n\nInput: Embeddings derived from sensor-based human activity data in a depression diagnosis cohort.\nExpected Output: Identification of bias clusters reflecting sensor data patterns potentially affecting mental health assessment fairness, supplemented by interpretable semantic annotations and expert validation feedback highlighting ethical concerns.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should the visualizations prove cognitively overwhelming or the interactive system underperform at scale, implement adaptive guided tours that summarize critical bias insights using natural language anchors extracted from the normative semantic lexicons. Additionally, provide simplified views that aggregate bias clusters and reduce dimensionality complexity. If lexicon construction reveals insufficient coverage or cultural representativeness, prioritize iterative lexicon expansion leveraging active expert feedback and incremental annotation strategies to enhance lexicon robustness before full deployment."

In particular, creating robust normative semantic lexicons is known to be complex due to the subjectivity and cultural variance of ethical concepts; more clarity on methods to ensure lexicon quality and coverage is needed. Additionally, the plan should specify metrics and criteria for validating interpretability and effectiveness of the visualizations, especially when engaging domain experts. To enhance feasibility, the plan should also consider scalability aspects of embedding extraction and dimensionality reduction for large LLMs, and how interactive tools will maintain responsiveness. Incorporating checkpoints for iterative validation and fallback plan deployment based on user testing outcomes would strengthen the scientific rigor and practicality of the experimental workflow. Please elaborate these aspects in the step-by-step plan for stronger feasibility assurance and reproducibility of your framework outputs and human-subject evaluations, which are crucial in this sensitive domain of ethical bias diagnostics and explainability tools integration with LLM embeddings."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the currently social bias–centric framing, enhance the impact and novelty by integrating your explainable ethical embedding visualizations with an application domain from the globally linked concepts, such as electronic health records or diagnosis of depression. For example, embedding representations from patient notes or sensor-based human activity recognition data could be analyzed for hidden social biases or ethical fairness concerns in clinical decision support. This integration would create a novel cross-disciplinary tool that helps diagnose biases not only abstractly in language models but concretely in sensitive healthcare data contexts. Such expansion would increase the broader societal impact by addressing fairness in medical AI applications, attract interdisciplinary interest, and differentiate your work more strongly from existing bias visualization methods that remain limited to generalized NLP embeddings. Explicitly illustrate how your framework can be extended or customized to support normative and fairness analyses in clinical narrative embeddings or sensor data embeddings used in mental health assessment, aligning with ethical principles in healthcare AI."
