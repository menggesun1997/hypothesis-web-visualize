    "title": "Cross-Cultural Intrinsic Evaluation Framework Incorporating Dignity and Psychosocial Distress Metrics",
    "Problem_Statement": "Intrinsic LLM evaluation currently lacks sensitivity towards cultural variations in constructs like dignity and psychosocial distress, limiting fairness and relevance across diverse populations.",
    "Motivation": "The proposal targets the external gap related to underexplored multi-country evaluation frameworks integrating social science insights on dignity and distress, addressing fairness and context-awareness in LLM assessment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a multi-country benchmark portraying culture-specific expressions of dignity and psychosocial distress extracted from regional social media and clinical narratives. Develop evaluation metrics that measure LLM outputs' adherence to culturally nuanced linguistic markers and social norms. Integrate these with perplexity and self-consistency to form a composite, culture-aware intrinsic evaluation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multilingual, multicultural corpora representing dignity and psychosocial distress in at least five distinct cultures.\n2. Collaborate with cultural experts to annotate key semantic and pragmatic markers.\n3. Develop cultural marker detectors.\n4. Evaluate LLM outputs generated on culturally framed prompts using standard intrinsic metrics.\n5. Introduce weighted metrics based on cultural marker alignment.\n6. Compare composite scores with human judgments across cultures.\n7. Analyze disparities and fairness implications.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input (Japanese): \"Describe ways to respectfully decline an invitation that may cause psychosocial distress.\"\nExpected Output: Responses exhibiting culturally appropriate honorifics and indirect communication receive higher composite scores, reflecting cultural dignity norms alongside perplexity and consistency.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cultural marker detection is unreliable, fallback on unsupervised clustering to identify language style patterns by culture. Utilize crowd-sourced human evaluations to supplement metric validation."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while comprehensive, may underestimate the complexity of ensuring reliable and valid cultural marker detection across diverse languages and dialects. The plan should incorporate iterative validation loops with cultural experts throughout data collection and annotation phases to mitigate annotation bias and ensure cultural representativeness. Additionally, the fallback plan relying on unsupervised clustering and crowdsourced evaluations might introduce noise and reduce reproducibility; a more structured semi-supervised learning framework should be considered to balance scalability and quality. Clarifying these methodological safeguards and resource requirements will enhance feasibility confidence and experimental robustness in a multilingual multicultural setting involving sensitive psychosocial constructs, which are inherently subjective and nuanced to operationalize within automated metrics. This is critical for trustworthiness and eventual adoption of the composite evaluation metrics in fairness-aware LLM assessment contexts (Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment marks this idea as NOV-COMPETITIVE due to closely linked existing research in fairness and cultural-aware evaluation, a strategic enhancement would be to explicitly integrate concepts from human-computer interaction theory and cultural communication to deepen cross-cultural interpretability and user alignment. For instance, designing evaluation tasks or prompts that reflect real-world human-computer interaction scenarios involving the coexistence of cultures and mental health problems could bridge theoretical and practical gaps. Furthermore, leveraging digital media development frameworks might facilitate dynamic updating of cultural markers to reflect evolving social norms and media trends globally. This integration would serve to broaden impact, differentiate the contribution, and foster adoption by the global academic community, aligning the framework with multi-disciplinary advances and emerging ethical AI standards (Motivation, Proposed_Method)."
