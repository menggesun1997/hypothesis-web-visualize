    "title": "EthicalNormEmbed: Embedding Space Analysis for Bias and Fairness via Normative Semantic Frameworks",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current embedding evaluation frameworks neglect normative and ethical dimensions, resulting in blind spots regarding biases, fairness, and social responsibility implicitly encoded in LLM embeddings.",
    "Motivation": "Fulfills the external gap connecting 'rights concepts', 'machine learning', and 'direction of science', by embedding ethical, semantic, and normative frameworks into embedding diagnostics. This transforms embedding evaluation into a tool for social responsibility and explainability in AI representations.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an embedding evaluation framework enriched with normative semantic analyzers that detect and quantify biases and fairness issues. Construct a semantic embedding subspace aligned with ethical concepts derived from normative theories (e.g., Rawlsian justice, rights-based ontologies). Introduce an 'Ethical Embedding Diagnostic' (EED) that measures biases by assessing deviations from normative semantic baselines within embeddings using explainable AI techniques.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate datasets annotated with ethically relevant attributes (gender, ethnicity, rights-related topics).\n2. Extract embeddings from multiple LLMs.\n3. Define normative semantic subspaces via symbolic and distributional semantics.\n4. Quantify deviations in embeddings along these subspaces using EED.\n5. Correlate EED results with standard bias benchmarks.\n6. Implement explainability modules to visualize bias loci in embedding space.\n7. Evaluate impact on downstream fairness-sensitive tasks (e.g., hiring recommendation systems).",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence pairs differing only in gender references.\nExpected Output: Embeddings showing minimal bias differences as measured by low EED, demonstrating fair representation. If biases detected, framework highlights semantic dimensions causing inequity.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If normative semantic alignment is challenging, incorporate adversarial debiasing during embedding fine-tuning or expand ethical concept lexicons. Alternatively, use counterfactual data augmentation to enhance bias detection sensitivity."
