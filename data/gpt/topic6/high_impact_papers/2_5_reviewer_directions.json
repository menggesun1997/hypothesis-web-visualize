    "title": "NormativeSemanticEmbedding Probes: Testing Ethical Value Encoding in LLM Spaces",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of probing tools that explicitly test how LLM embeddings encode normative ethical values and rights concepts, hindering reliable assessment of social responsibility in representations.",
    "Motivation": "This idea directly confronts the external gap linking 'rights concepts' and 'machine learning' by developing specialized probes derived from normative semantic theories, a novel research direction for embedding explainability and fairness.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a set of embedding probes based on normative ethical lexicons and semantic features indicative of rights and value concepts. Implement multi-dimensional probes that assess embedding sensitivity to normative contrasts (e.g., freedom vs. restriction). Use these probes to map and visualize normative semantic subspaces within embedding geometries quantitatively.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Construct normative ethical lexicons with expert collaboration.\n2. Extract LLM embeddings for probe keywords and constructs.\n3. Develop multi-dimensional probing models sensitive to normative variation.\n4. Visualize normative semantic embeddings subspaces.\n5. Evaluate probe consistency across models and training stages.\n6. Correlate results with fairness and bias assessment benchmarks.\n7. Deploy explainability dashboards for stakeholder auditing.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Words 'justice', 'discrimination', 'freedom'.\nExpected Output: Probes reveal coherent and interpretable normative semantic vectors indicating model alignment with ethical concept relations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If probes have low discriminative power, iteratively refine lexicons or incorporate behavioral probing via model-generated text reflecting normative judgments."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that normative ethical values and rights concepts can be meaningfully and consistently encoded in LLM embeddings and quantitatively probed using semantic lexicons. However, embeddings primarily reflect statistical co-occurrences rather than normative reasoning, which may limit the validity of directly linking normative ethical theories to embedding geometries. It would strengthen the approach to explicitly discuss and empirically validate assumptions about the representational fidelity of these complex social concepts in LLM spaces before extensive probe development. Consider analyzing embedding stability and conceptual alignment with ethical theory using preliminary small-scale studies to ground this assumption firmly before full scale experimentation is pursued. Such validation will improve the soundness of the core premise and mitigate risk of spurious interpretations of probe outputs in downstream fairness analyses or auditing tools. This step is critical because misinterpreting embedding representations could undermine the entire motivation to measure social responsibility in embeddings effectively and reliably, leading to misleading audit reports or fairness assessments. Clarify and justify these foundational assumptions more thoroughly in the proposal to bolster methodological rigor and theoretical coherence in this nascent probing direction. This critique targets the 'Problem_Statement' and 'Proposed_Method' sections where the foundational premises are stated but lack explicit empirical grounding or theoretical nuance regarding embedding semantics vs. normative content encoding limitations.  \n\n\n"

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan is comprehensive but ambitious, involving multiple complex stages such as lexicon construction with experts, multi-dimensional probe development, and cross-model consistency evaluation. While the plan is scientifically sound in concept, it lacks concrete details ensuring feasibility within typical resource constraints of academic research, notably: 1) The mechanism and criteria for expert collaboration in lexicon development are vague—defining roles, scope, and quality control methods would enhance confidence in this critical step. 2) The plan does not specify validation metrics or thresholds for the probe sensitivity and discriminative power, which are essential for iterative refinement or fallback decisions. 3) The deployment phase (explainability dashboards for auditing) may require significant engineering effort beyond scholarly contribution and might be better scoped as a future work or prototype demonstration. 4) Potential challenges in correlating probe outputs with existing fairness and bias benchmarks (which may not directly measure normative concept encoding) need addressing—establishing clear operationalizations and justification for such correlations will help feasibility. To strengthen feasibility, it is recommended to prioritize early-stage pilot experiments focusing on probe development and small-scale consistency checks before full visualization and deployment. Additionally, clarifying resource requirements, expert engagement models, and evaluation protocols will greatly improve the practical tractability of the plan, reducing risk of overextension or stagnation. This critique targets the 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' section, urging a tighter, more detailed operationalization of key experimental steps to ensure the project can be delivered successfully within standard research timelines and resource limits."
