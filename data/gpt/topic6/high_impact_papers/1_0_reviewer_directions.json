    "title": "Contextualizing Self-Consistency Metrics with Online Health Discourse Analysis",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic evaluation metrics like self-consistency and perplexity treat model outputs in isolation, lacking sensitivity to social context and discourse dynamics prevalent in online health communities. This inhibits evaluating LLMs' real-world social impact relevance, especially in digital health.",
    "Motivation": "This research addresses the external/novel gap between online spaces and social sciences, particularly integrating discourse moves and digital health concepts with intrinsic LLM evaluation metrics, as identified in the map's hidden bridges. It moves beyond static perplexity to a context-aware evaluation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid intrinsic evaluation metric that augments self-consistency with discourse move recognition modules trained on health-focused online forums. The method extracts discourse features (e.g., question, affirmation, caution) and computes context-conditioned consistency scores reflecting alignment with community norms and social support dynamics. This combines qualitative discourse analysis methodologies from social sciences with computational LLM metrics to generate socially-informed evaluation results.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets from online health forums, Reddit health communities, and digital health Q&A platforms.\n2. Annotate discourse moves using expert social science coding protocols.\n3. Fine-tune discourse move classifiers.\n4. Implement self-consistency evaluation modified to weight responses by discourse move types.\n5. Baseline against standard self-consistency and perplexity.\n6. Evaluate correlations with human social impact assessments and domain expert ratings.\n7. Perform ablation to isolate each component’s contribution.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What are safe treatments for mild anxiety during pregnancy?\" \nExpected Output: Self-consistency scores differ when model answers repeatedly caution and cite social support sources vs. generic medical advice. Higher contextual self-consistency when responses align with discourse moves encouraging community care and respect for psychosocial distress.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If discourse move recognition proves noisy, fallback to simpler sentiment analysis integration. Alternatively, use rule-based lexicons of social support terms as proxies. Conduct user studies to validate metric relevance if computational correlations falter."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that discourse moves such as question, affirmation, and caution can be reliably recognized and meaningfully weighted in self-consistency metrics needs stronger empirical justification upfront. Online health discourse is highly diverse and noisy, and the social impact relevance of these discourse moves might vary significantly across communities. The proposal should explicitly clarify and support why conditioning self-consistency on these specific discourse moves will systematically improve evaluation of LLM outputs in digital health, distinguishing this from simpler sentiment or thematic weighting approaches. Addressing this will strengthen the soundness of the foundational premise underlying the method's expected benefits and avoid overgeneralization risks inherent in social discourse modeling for LLM evaluation purposes. Consider elaborating on theoretical or preliminary qualitative evidence that links discourse moves to user perception of social support and health communication effectiveness, beyond the current social sciences coding references, to solidify this assumption's validity and clarity in the Proposed_Method section of the proposal."
