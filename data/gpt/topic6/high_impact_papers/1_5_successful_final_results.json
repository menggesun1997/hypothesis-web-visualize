    "title": "Cross-Country Comparative Framework Linking Psychosocial Distress Expression and LLM Intrinsic Evaluation",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of frameworks to evaluate intrinsic LLM performance on culturally diverse expressions of psychosocial distress, challenging model fairness and applicability across countries.",
    "Motivation": "This idea leverages the 'groups of countries' hidden bridge by creating cross-country evaluation frameworks combining social sciences insight with LLM intrinsic metrics, filling an important external gap regarding diversity sensitivity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create parallel corpora of psychosocial distress expressions from multiple countries and languages. Design intrinsic metrics that assess LLM responses for alignment with local linguistic and cultural norms of distress expression by integrating perplexity and self-consistency with cultural norm detectors. Perform cross-country comparative benchmarking to identify performance disparities and guide localization efforts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect and preprocess distress narratives from diverse countries' social media and clinical texts.\n2. Annotate cultural linguistic features and expression norms.\n3. Train cultural norm detectors.\n4. Generate LLM outputs for distress prompts.\n5. Compute integrated intrinsic metrics combining perplexity, consistency, and cultural alignment.\n6. Compare metrics cross-country.\n7. Publish benchmark and fairness analysis reports.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input (Brazilian Portuguese): A textual narrative expressing social exclusion and anxiety.\nExpected Output: Properly localized LLM outputs scored higher by the intrinsic framework for exhibiting culturally consonant phrasing and empathy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cross-language data scarcity arises, focus on high-resource countries first and apply domain adaptation techniques. If cultural norm detector underperforms, replace with human-in-the-loop evaluations."

        "title": "Cross-Country Comparative Framework Linking Psychosocial Distress Expression and LLM Intrinsic Evaluation with Clinical Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current frameworks inadequately evaluate intrinsic LLM performance on culturally diverse expressions of psychosocial distress, limiting model fairness and applicability across different countries. Furthermore, existing approaches lack integration with clinically validated mental health assessments, weakening real-world relevance and external validation.",
        "Motivation": "Building on the bridge of 'groups of countries' and cultural diversity in psychosocial distress expression, this proposal fundamentally advances intrinsic LLM evaluation by incorporating rigorous cultural norm detectors co-developed with mental health professionals and embedding clinically validated distress assessment tools. This clinical integration, combined with a scalable and ethically compliant annotation and data strategy, addresses the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty challenge by tightly linking AI fairness with global mental health priorities. Leveraging international mental health collaboration not only deepens clinical relevance and dataset richness but also enables translational opportunities to improve culturally adapted AI-enabled mental health interventions, thus broadening scientific and societal impact beyond intrinsic model evaluation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "1. Collaborate with international mental health organizations and platforms to acquire diverse, ethically sourced psychosocial distress narratives, including patient-reported outcomes and clinically validated distress assessments (e.g., culturally adapted scales).\n2. Collect parallel corpora from multiple countries and languages, ensuring compliance with global data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) and ethical guidelines via standardized protocols.\n3. Develop culturally sensitive annotation protocols co-designed with clinical experts and cultural psychologists to identify linguistic features and psychosocial distress expression norms; ensure high inter-annotator agreement through iterative training and validation cycles.\n4. Train and validate cultural norm detectors using multi-source data, applying rigorous performance criteria (e.g., F1 scores, cross-validation across cultures) and incorporating explainability methods to verify alignment with cultural nuances.\n5. Implement fallback contingency strategies beyond human-in-the-loop, including semi-supervised domain adaptation, cross-lingual transfer learning, and active learning to address detector generalization challenges.\n6. Generate LLM outputs for distress prompts and compute integrated intrinsic metrics combining perplexity, self-consistency, cultural alignment scores from norm detectors, and clinical distress concordance metrics.\n7. Perform cross-country benchmarking with statistical fairness analysis, correlating intrinsic metrics with clinical validation outcomes.\n8. Publish an open-access benchmark suite and comprehensive fairness reports, accompanied by guidance for culturally tailored LLM deployment in mental health contexts.\n9. Establish a feedback loop with mental health partners to iteratively refine models and evaluation framework towards real-world intervention support.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Step 1: Establish partnerships with international mental health organizations to access culturally diverse, ethically compliant datasets including patient narratives and outcome measures.\nStep 2: Design and pilot culturally sensitive annotation protocols with mental health professionals; recruit and train multilingual annotators. Perform pilot annotations and compute inter-annotator agreement (target Cohen's Kappa > 0.75).\nStep 3: Scale annotation using stratified sampling to cover diverse demographics and distress types; iteratively refine based on quality checks.\nStep 4: Train cultural norm detectors on annotated data using transformer-based models with explainability layers; evaluate via cross-validation within and across languages.\nStep 5: Apply semi-supervised and domain adaptation techniques to improve detector robustness; monitor performance drop with pre-defined thresholds.\nStep 6: Generate LLM distress-related outputs; score with integrated intrinsic framework combining perplexity, self-consistency, cultural norm alignment, and clinical distress concordance.\nStep 7: Conduct fairness and performance benchmarking across countries; perform statistical analyses linking intrinsic scores to clinical validity.\nStep 8: Document methods, datasets, and results; release benchmark and tools for community use ensuring compliance with privacy and ethical norms.\nStep 9: Engage mental health partners to assess translational potential and refine framework in iterative cycles.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input (Brazilian Portuguese): A social media narrative expressing feelings of social exclusion and anxiety, linked with clinical distress assessment indicating moderate anxiety level.\nExpected Output: LLM generates empathetic, culturally resonant responses validated by high scores in perplexity, self-consistency, and cultural norm detector alignment, which also correlate with clinical distress concordance metrics.\n\nInput (Japanese): A clinical text describing psychosomatic complaints with subtle cultural expressions of distress.\nExpected Output: LLM produces responses respecting local indirect communication styles, scored favorably by cultural norm detectors and confirmed by matched clinical assessment correlations.\n\nInput (English - UK): Patient-reported outcome narratives collected via mental health app.\nExpected Output: LLM outputs reflect culturally typical distress expressions and maintain clinically relevant nuances, verified through integrated intrinsic and clinical concordance evaluations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If cross-country multilingual data scarcity occurs, focus initial work on well-resourced languages and countries with existing mental health data partnerships. To address cultural norm detector limitations, implement semi-supervised learning, cross-lingual transfer, and active learning to improve generalization systematically rather than relying solely on human-in-the-loop. Where detectors underperform, integrate additional clinical validation layers using patient-reported outcomes and simple automated proxy metrics. For data privacy or ethical challenges, adopt synthetic data augmentation aligned with real-world distribution and utilize federated learning approaches to mitigate direct data sharing issues."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while comprehensive, lacks clarity on how cultural norm detectors will be trained and validated, especially considering the complexity and variability of psychosocial distress expressions across different languages and cultures. The plan should explicitly address strategies for ensuring high-quality, culturally sensitive annotations, the criteria for cultural norm detector performance, and contingency plans beyond human-in-the-loop in case of poor detector generalization. Additionally, scalability concerns arise given the requirement for data from multiple countries—details on sourcing, data privacy, and ethical considerations need further bolstering to establish practical feasibility at scale and compliance with data protection norms across jurisdictions. Expanding on these will strengthen confidence in the study's operational viability and reproducibility in a highly challenging domain and multilingual context, which is critical given the competitive nature of this research area and data resource constraints noted in the fallback plan (e.g., domain adaptation). Revising the Experiment_Plan accordingly is essential for solid feasibility assessment and successful execution of this cross-cultural LLM evaluation framework.  This includes specifying annotation protocols, sampling strategies, and resource allocation for diverse data sources and multilingual norm detector development and evaluation pipelines, thus reducing ambiguity and enhancing practical clarity for implementation."

          "feedback_content": "Given the competitive novelty rating (NOV-COMPETITIVE) and the focus on psychosocial distress expression—an area deeply linked to mental health care—the idea could substantially enhance impact and distinctiveness by integrating direct collaboration or data-sharing partnerships with international mental health care organizations or platforms. Incorporating clinically validated distress assessment tools or real-world patient-reported outcomes within the evaluation framework could provide robust external validation and deeper clinical relevance. Furthermore, leveraging such partnerships to enrich datasets and to apply findings for improving culturally adapted mental health interventions via LLMs would not only strengthen fairness and applicability claims but also align the framework tightly with global health priorities. This integration can enable bridging between cutting-edge AI fairness research and practical healthcare improvements internationally, thereby broadening innovation scope and increasing societal and academic impact beyond intrinsic evaluation metrics alone."
