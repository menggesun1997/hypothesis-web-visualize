        "title": "Robotic Semiotic Interpretation Framework for Artifact-Driven LLM Probes",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic benchmarking of LLMs lacks integration of embodied, multi-sensory artifact interpretation to probe cultural context understanding. This results in superficial assessments of model socio-cognitive depth, trustworthiness, and contextual reasoning. Bridging robotics and archaeological semantics can enable intrinsic benchmarking that closely reflects human material culture interpretation, overcoming current limitations.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the critical internal gap of limited integration between advanced robotics and artifact interpretation and the external gap identified in hidden bridges linking archaeological theory and practical robots. This novel framework augments intrinsic LLM benchmarking by grounding probes in embodied, multi-modal artifact semantics via robotic sensing and reasoning.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an embodied robotic system equipped with multi-modal sensor fusion (visual, tactile, spectral imaging) to autonomously explore and interpret cultural artifacts. Integrate self-supervised learning modules that translate sensor data into structured semantic representations aligned with archaeological theory. Then generate intrinsic probes for LLMs based on these semantic artifact interpretations, forcing models to answer culturally grounded questions derived from real-world robotic observations.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect a dataset of artifacts with extensive multi-modal sensor recordings (e.g., 3D scans, spectra, tactile feedback).\n2. Develop a robotic platform with integrated sensors and autonomous exploration algorithms.\n3. Train vision-tactile self-supervised models to extract artifact features and semantic embeddings.\n4. Map embedding outputs to archaeological theoretical concepts.\n5. Design LLM probes (questions) from the interpreted semantic content.\n6. Evaluate LLM answers against expert annotations using metrics like semantic similarity, cultural accuracy, and trustworthiness.\n7. Compare with baseline intrinsic benchmarking approaches lacking embodied inputs.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multi-sensor data from a pottery shard collected by the robot. Generated probe: \"Based on the detected rim curvature and pigment patterns, which cultural period does this artifact most likely belong to, and what function might it have served?\" Expected output: LLM responds with a culturally precise explanation referencing known archaeological classifications and socio-functional roles.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If robotic sensing integration is too noisy or inconclusive, fallback to high-fidelity simulated artifact sensor data to train and test the probing framework. Additionally, perform ablations removing certain sensors to identify critical modalities and simplify the system. Also, test direct textual descriptions of artifacts to validate probe generation before full robotic embodiment."

        "title": "Multi-Modal Autonomous Artifact Sensing to Enhance LLM Cultural Reasoning Probes",
        "Problem_Statement": "Intrinsic benchmarking of LLMs currently underrepresents multi-modal, culture-rich scenarios which challenge foundation models' reasoning with embodied and contextualized knowledge. Existing evaluations inadequately link language understanding with sensory and spatial artifact contexts prevalent in human cultural cognition.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the external gap involving missing autonomous robotic sensing and fusion technologies in LLM intrinsic benchmark development, specifically leveraging hidden bridges between multi-modal sensor fusion, self-supervised learning, and archaeological frameworks to create richer socio-cognitive probes.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a pipeline that treats multi-modal autonomous robotic artifact sensing outputs as foundational embeddings to synthesize enriched language understanding probes. This pipeline includes multi-sensor data fusion, embedding artifact context into vector spaces, and generating LLM prompts that require multi-modal grounding and socio-cultural reasoning.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Aggregate multi-modal sensor datasets of cultural artifacts including visual, infrared, and tactile data.\n2. Employ deep multi-modal fusion networks with self-supervised objectives to learn joint embeddings.\n3. Develop an artifact context embedding space linked to archaeological theories.\n4. Automate LLM prompt generation based on embeddings to test cultural reasoning tasks.\n5. Benchmark LLMs against standard and enriched probe sets measuring reasoning, trustworthiness, and emergent property understanding.\n6. Conduct ablation studies to evaluate impact of each sensor modality.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A fused embedding vector representing combined visual and spectral properties of an ancient inscription. Probe: \"Identify the probable socio-political significance of the depicted symbols based on multi-modal sensory context.\" Output: LLM explains in historically contextualized language, citing plausible symbolic meanings with reasoning.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the multi-modal fusion struggles to create informative embeddings, shift focus to modality-specific embeddings combined through simpler concatenation strategies. Alternatively, use synthetic artifact simulation datasets to enhance training before applying real data."

        "title": "Socio-Cognitive Grounding Probes for LLMs Based on Robotic Archaeological Exploration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current language understanding probes for LLMs lack grounding in embodied cultural knowledge and socio-cognitive contexts, limiting assessment of models’ trustworthiness and reasoning under real-world, material culture-inspired conditions.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap in model evaluation for reasoning and trustworthiness, and the novel opportunity to fuse emergent LLM properties with robotics-driven data acquisition, by synthesizing culturally and historically grounded socio-cognitive probes derived from robotic exploration of material artifacts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Deploy autonomous robots to explore archaeological sites, collecting multi-modal sensor data and contextual metadata. Translate these experiences into language model probes that demand socio-cognitive processing—inferring ritualistic, societal, or symbolic meaning—reflective of the artifacts' cultural roles. Integrate these probes into LLM benchmarking suites to measure deeper understanding and emergent reasoning capabilities.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop robotic exploration strategy for archaeological sites recording sensor data and environmental context.\n2. Collect curated multimodal datasets aligned with specific cultural hypotheses (e.g., ritual significance).\n3. Annotate datasets with expert socio-cognitive interpretations.\n4. Construct LLM prompts that require integrating multi-modal knowledge and reasoning.\n5. Evaluate LLMs on these probes with metrics for cultural coherence, reasoning chains, and confidence calibration.\n6. Contrast results with traditional benchmarking datasets lacking socio-cognitive grounding.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Robot-collected sensor data from a burial urn associated with funerary rites. Probe: \"Based on the shape, material, and location, infer the sociocultural beliefs reflected in this artifact's use.\" Output: LLM provides a historically grounded interpretation discussing ritualistic burial customs and societal values inferred from the data.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If socio-cognitive grounding is too difficult initially, start with simpler cultural context probes derived from static multi-modal datasets. Also, introduce incremental complexity in probe design, moving from descriptive to interpretive questions as model capabilities improve."

        "title": "Living Multi-Domain Intrinsic Benchmarking Environment for Cultural and Linguistic Dynamicity",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing intrinsic benchmarking frameworks for LLMs rely on static or narrowly scoped datasets that fail to reflect the evolving nature of cultural knowledge, linguistic diversity, and interpretive frameworks, limiting real-world robustness and adaptability evaluations.",
        "Motivation": "Directly addresses the high-potential innovation opportunity to develop a continuously updated, interdisciplinary benchmark environment merging autonomous robotic sensing with dynamic encyclopedic references, overcoming static evaluation limitations and enriching multi-domain interpretability metrics.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create a continuously integrated benchmarking platform combining live data streams from autonomous archaeological robotic explorations with dynamically updated online encyclopedic knowledge bases. This platform auto-generates new intrinsic probes reflecting current cultural insights and linguistic changes, providing LLMs with evolving, context-rich evaluation challenges that measure interpretability, adaptability, and robustness over time.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Establish robotic sensor data pipelines feeding artifact and environmental data into the platform.\n2. Integrate APIs to online encyclopedias and cultural databases enabling live knowledge updates.\n3. Design algorithms for automatic probe generation merging live sensor insights with updated knowledge.\n4. Evaluate LLMs periodically on the evolving probe sets.\n5. Measure changes in interpretability metrics, adaptability, and trustworthiness.\n6. Compare results to static benchmark baselines.\n7. Collect expert feedback to refine probe relevance.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Newly discovered set of multi-modal artifact data merged with latest archaeological theory updates from the encyclopedia. Generated probe: \"Explain how recent reinterpretations of the artifact’s symbolic motifs reshape prior cultural understanding and what implications this has for the historical timeline.\" Expected Output: LLM demonstrates updated reasoning incorporating new knowledge, showing improved adaptability and grounding.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time integration proves challenging, begin with periodic batch updates and semi-automated probe generation. Validate the concept with offline datasets representing temporal snapshots to simulate evolving benchmarks."

        "title": "Self-Supervised Multi-Modal Embedding Alignment for Intrinsic LLM Artefact Probing",
        "Problem_Statement": "There is a fragmented understanding of how large language models internally represent complex multi-modal cultural artifacts, limiting intrinsic benchmarking approaches that seek to understand foundational language cognition influenced by embodied perception and cultural context.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap in comprehensive intrinsic benchmarking methods by integrating advanced self-supervised learning techniques from autonomous robotics and multi-modal sensor fusion to generate aligned embeddings that bridge sensory artifact data and language model internal representations in novel ways.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Train self-supervised multi-modal embedding models that jointly encode robotic sensory data of artifacts and corresponding textual archaeological descriptions. This alignment enables the direct probing of LLM latent representations using multi-modal context vectors, revealing emergent reasoning patterns and model failure modes with respect to embodied cultural knowledge.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Gather paired datasets of artifact sensory inputs and expert textual descriptions.\n2. Develop self-supervised contrastive or masked prediction models to learn joint embeddings.\n3. Probe LLM internal states by mapping latent activations to these embedding spaces.\n4. Design intrinsic benchmark tasks that test consistency and alignment between LLM outputs and robotic sensory contexts.\n5. Evaluate model performance using metrics like alignment loss, representational similarity analysis, and probing accuracy.\n6. Compare with baseline non-aligned probing techniques.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Robotic visual and tactile recordings of an ancient coin and corresponding textual description. Probe: \"Assess if LLM latent representations consistently encode the coin’s cultural era and usage context.\" Expected output: Quantitative alignment scores reveal the presence or absence of multimodal grounding in language representations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If self-supervised alignment underperforms, consider supervised fine-tuning with curated labeled pairs or pre-training on synthetic multi-modal artifact-text datasets to improve embedding quality. Alternatively, explore variational methods to capture embedding uncertainty."
