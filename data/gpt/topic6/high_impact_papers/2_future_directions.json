        "title": "ModalSemanticsEmbed: Embedding Representations Aligned with Modal Ontology Structures",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current embedding evaluation methods fail to integrate modal and ontological aspects of knowledge representation, lacking metrics that assess whether embeddings encode modal operators and relations reflective of world structures. Without such integration, embeddings may not capture structured, hierarchical, or normative semantic information critical for meaningful representation.",
        "Motivation": "This project directly addresses the internal gap of insufficient integration between metaphysical/modal structures and empirical embedding evaluation. By bridging modal logic frameworks ('modal questions' and 'modal operators') with embedding space analysis, we pioneer metrics that operationalize ontological semantics, extending beyond statistical similarity to structural semantic fidelity.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid framework that maps modal logic operators and relational modal semantics into embedding space construals. Specifically, construct modal logic-guided transformations to generate synthetic datasets of modal relations, and then design embedding evaluation metrics that test for preservation of these modal structures. Introduce 'Modal Relation Preservation Score' (MRPS) to quantitatively assess whether embeddings maintain accessibility relations and modal epistemic states relevant to knowledge hierarchies. Integrate symbolic modal logic processing into the embedding evaluation pipeline, enabling direct comparison of modal relations vis-à-vis geometric embedding distances and directions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect benchmark datasets with explicit modal semantic annotations (e.g., corpora annotated with necessity, possibility, counterfactuals).\n2. Select pre-trained LLMs (GPT variants, BERT-based models) and extract embedding spaces.\n3. Implement modal relation extraction pipelines and generate synthetic modal relation examples.\n4. Define and compute MRPS for model embeddings.\n5. Compare MRPS with standard embedding similarity metrics and probing results.\n6. Perform ablation studies to examine contribution of modal embedding dimensions.\n7. Validate on downstream tasks requiring modal reasoning (e.g., modal question answering).",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence pair 'It is necessary that all humans are mortal' vs. 'Some humans might be immortal.'\nExpected Output: Embedding pairs represent contrasting modal states where MRPS quantifies preservation of necessity vs. possibility relations; a high MRPS indicates embeddings structurally reflect these modal distinctions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If modal relation preservation metrics do not outperform existing methods, shift to designing auxiliary tasks that fine-tune embeddings explicitly on modal logic knowledge to improve representation quality. Alternatively, explore graph neural networks to better encode modal accessibility graphs before embedding extraction."

        "title": "CrossDomain Semantic Fidelity Benchmarks for LLM Embeddings",
        "Problem_Statement": "Embeddings inadequately capture consistent semantic grounding across heterogeneous scientific domains such as chemistry, biology, and physics, leading to unreliable cross-domain inference and representation quality assessments.",
        "Motivation": "This addresses the internal gap of limited cross-domain semantic evaluation by leveraging foundational scientific datasets ('Handbook of Chemistry' cluster) to create rigorous, domain-grounded benchmarks. We extend current embedding analysis beyond isolated domains to a unified cross-disciplinary semantic assessment framework.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a suite of embedding evaluation benchmarks combining curated datasets from multiple scientific domains with known cross-domain semantic correspondences and contrasts. Employ advanced pattern recognition techniques to extract domain-specific semantic relations and then evaluate how well embeddings from LLMs maintain these relations jointly. Introduce a 'Semantic Concordance Index' (SCI) that measures embedding fidelity across domain boundaries, weighting domain relevance and conceptual overlap.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Aggregate multi-domain curated datasets with aligned semantic entities (e.g., molecular structures in chemistry linked to biological functions).\n2. Extract embeddings from state-of-the-art LLMs.\n3. Develop algorithms to detect known cross-domain relationships (e.g., elemental properties impacting biological processes) within embedding space.\n4. Calculate SCI and compare across LLMs.\n5. Perform human expert validation of cross-domain semantic coherence.\n6. Benchmark against existing single-domain embedding evaluation methods.\n7. Test on downstream cross-domain reasoning tasks, like biomedical knowledge inference.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Concepts 'Hemoglobin' (biology) and 'Iron' (chemistry) embeddings.\nExpected Output: Embeddings should demonstrate proximity and relational consistency reflecting their real-world chemical-biological link (e.g., iron's critical role in hemoglobin function), achieving a high SCI score.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If SCI proves insufficiently sensitive, incorporate generative probing tasks to test embeddings’ ability to contextualize cross-domain entities in generated text. Alternatively, extend benchmarks with expert-curated cross-domain analogies."

        "Motivation": "Fulfills the external gap connecting 'rights concepts', 'machine learning', and 'direction of science', by embedding ethical, semantic, and normative frameworks into embedding diagnostics. This transforms embedding evaluation into a tool for social responsibility and explainability in AI representations.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an embedding evaluation framework enriched with normative semantic analyzers that detect and quantify biases and fairness issues. Construct a semantic embedding subspace aligned with ethical concepts derived from normative theories (e.g., Rawlsian justice, rights-based ontologies). Introduce an 'Ethical Embedding Diagnostic' (EED) that measures biases by assessing deviations from normative semantic baselines within embeddings using explainable AI techniques.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate datasets annotated with ethically relevant attributes (gender, ethnicity, rights-related topics).\n2. Extract embeddings from multiple LLMs.\n3. Define normative semantic subspaces via symbolic and distributional semantics.\n4. Quantify deviations in embeddings along these subspaces using EED.\n5. Correlate EED results with standard bias benchmarks.\n6. Implement explainability modules to visualize bias loci in embedding space.\n7. Evaluate impact on downstream fairness-sensitive tasks (e.g., hiring recommendation systems).",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence pairs differing only in gender references.\nExpected Output: Embeddings showing minimal bias differences as measured by low EED, demonstrating fair representation. If biases detected, framework highlights semantic dimensions causing inequity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If normative semantic alignment is challenging, incorporate adversarial debiasing during embedding fine-tuning or expand ethical concept lexicons. Alternatively, use counterfactual data augmentation to enhance bias detection sensitivity."

This proposes embedding metrics inspired by human knowledge acquisition and normative reasoning developmental stages, which is a novel direction addressing both internal and external gaps.",

Map developmental psychology constructs onto embedding geometry patterns to assess embedding maturity and normative knowledge encoding. Develop 'Developmental Semantic Fidelity Index' (DSFI) as a quantitative measure.",

Generate synthetic and real-world datasets reflecting knowledge complexity levels.\n3. Extract embeddings from multiple LLMs.\n4. Analyze embedding geometries for developmental stage markers (e.g., hierarchical clustering, modal necessity encoding).\n5. Compute DSFI and correlate with model size and training progress.\n6. Perform longitudinal analysis tracking embedding evolution during fine-tuning.\n7. Validate on cognitive reasoning tasks reliant on normative understanding.",

        "Motivation": "Addresses internal and external gaps by using domain-specific ontology and handbook data to rigorously ground embedding evaluations, combining 'direction of science' with pattern recognition techniques. This ensures cross-domain fidelity and explainability in scientific representation within embeddings.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create a pipeline integrating domain ontologies (e.g., chemical ontologies from Handbook of Chemistry) with pattern recognition techniques to evaluate embeddings for intra-domain semantic consistency and accuracy. Develop an Explainable Domain Embedding Assessment (EDEA) toolkit that aligns embedding clusters with ontology nodes and quantitatively measures domain knowledge coverage and semantic precision.",
