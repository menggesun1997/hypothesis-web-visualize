        "title": "Cross-modal Behavioral Consistency via Multimodal Generative Adversarial Embeddings",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic evaluation metrics for LLMs often rely on surface-level textual consistency measures, lacking depth in understanding nuanced behavioral consistency across multiple modalities and adversarial perturbations.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the internal gap of insufficient robustness testing tools that incorporate learned representations and advanced ML frameworks, this project fuses biomedical-inspired generative adversarial models with multimodel inference. It leverages the hidden bridge between biomedical sciences and information-theoretic approaches to enhance evaluations beyond traditional methods.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a framework that integrates multimodal generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained on text, audio, and image data to generate challenging adversarial scenarios. Use deep embedded clustering on GAN outputs to extract semantics-aware embeddings of LLM responses. Then, perform multimodel inference comparing these embeddings across perturbed and original prompts to quantify behavioral consistency. This approach captures not only textual fidelity but robust semantic and conceptual consistency under adversarial conditions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect a multimodal benchmark dataset combining text questions, relevant images, and audio cues. 2. Train multimodal GANs to generate subtle adversarial perturbations in each modality. 3. Generate embeddings using deep clustering of LLM outputs under these perturbations. 4. Perform multimodel Bayesian inference to assess consistency metrics. 5. Compare against traditional text-only robustness metrics. 6. Use biomedical-inspired statistical tests for validation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input prompt: \"Describe the effects of insulin on blood glucose regulation.\" Perturbed input (adversarial image slightly modified to confuse context) to LLM. Expected output: Behavioral consistency score remains high indicating stable, semantically coherent responses despite perturbations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal GAN training proves unstable, simplify to text-image modalities or use pretrained embeddings like CLIP for adversarial scenario generation. Alternatively, implement rule-based adversarial perturbations while retaining the multimodel inference framework."

        "title": "Ethically Anchored Behavioral Consistency Metrics for LLMs in Socio-Legal Contexts",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing intrinsic evaluation methods do not incorporate ethical, legal, or mental health considerations, leading to evaluation methods disconnected from societal impact and co-production of science principles.",
        "Motivation": "Filling the external gap linking biomedical sciences to sociopolitical frameworks, this idea innovates by embedding ethical and socio-legal safeguards directly into behavioral consistency checks, creating a socially responsible evaluation paradigm.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a multi-layer evaluation framework that integrates behavioral consistency tests with an ethical constraint layer derived from socio-legal ontologies and mental health impact models. Develop modules that score LLM outputs for alignment with ethical guidelines, socio-legal admissibility, and mental health risk, alongside traditional robustness metrics. Incorporate feedback loops that adjust evaluation weights based on societal impact severity.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate or develop a dataset of text prompts with labeled socio-ethical and legal considerations. 2. Encode these considerations into formal ontologies and scoring algorithms. 3. Deploy existing LLMs and evaluate outputs on combined behavioral and ethical consistency metrics. 4. Benchmark against conventional evaluation methods. 5. Conduct expert review to validate socio-legal relevance of scores.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input prompt: \"Advise a user on managing mental health during a crisis.\" Expected output: High behavioral consistency with zero scores on potential ethical violations or misinformation, ensuring safe and responsible content generation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If formal ontologies are too coarse, integrate crowd-sourced human evaluations to calibrate ethical scores. Alternatively, focus on subsets of ethical domains such as misinformation or privacy for initial validation."

        "Problem_Statement": "Behavioral consistency validation lacks deep theoretical grounding, limiting understanding of generalization, explainability, and trustworthiness in LLM robustness assessments.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the hidden bridge connecting information-theoretic approaches and mysteries of state, this project innovates by utilizing VC theory and learning algorithm behavior to formulate explainable, statistically rigorous metrics beyond empirical performance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a new class of robustness evaluation metrics derived from estimating the VC-dimension and capacity measures of LLM decision boundaries through behavioral testing. Implement theoretical analysis correlating these measures with generalization bounds and confidence intervals. Integrate these with interpretability tools to provide explainable evaluation reports linking LLM architecture to behavioral stability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Define behavioral tests targeting various perturbation levels on LLM inputs. 2. Develop algorithms to approximate VC-dimension-related metrics from observed responses. 3. Validate theoretical predictions against empirical robustness on benchmark datasets. 4. Compare with standard explainability and robustness metrics. 5. Publish an open-source tool for community validation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Test on prompts with varied complexity (e.g., \"Translate a legal contract clause\" vs. \"Summarize a scientific abstract\") and measure derived VC-related robustness. Expected outputs: interpretable scores indicating the theoretical generalization capacity and robustness confidence.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If estimating VC-dimension proves intractable, use proxy measures such as Rademacher complexity or margin distributions. Alternatively, focus on simplified LLM components or smaller models to validate methodology."

        "Motivation": "Filling the internal gap of multimodel inference frameworks applicable to LLM evaluation, leveraging biomedical models that capture spatial and temporal dependencies, this project brings novel rigor to LLM robustness assessment.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create an evaluation suite that simulates biomedical spatial-temporal contexts (e.g., disease spread models) as complex prompt scenarios to test LLM responses. Use multimodel inference combining outputs from different LLM architectures and prompt variants, employing robust statistical comparison to detect behavioral inconsistencies and infer uncertainty with biomedical modeling analogs.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Design synthetic biomedical scenario prompts modeled on spatial epidemiology. 2. Query multiple LLMs architectures with variations. 3. Apply multimodel statistical tests to compare response distributions. 4. Measure robustness via consistency scores and uncertainty quantification. 5. Cross-validate with domain experts for semantic accuracy and meaningfulness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Prompt describing hypothetical infection spread in a population; expected LLM responses should maintain consistent and robust modeling perspectives despite prompt tweaking, reflected in low uncertainty and high behavioral consistency.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If synthetic biomedical scenarios do not induce meaningful behavioral variation, pivot to real clinical trial summary data or patient health record de-identifications to sustain evaluation relevance."
