Since then mathematical biology and medicine has grown at an astonishing rate and has established itself as a distinct discipline. Mathematical modelling is now being applied in every major discipline in the biomedical sciences. Though the field has become increasingly large and specialized, this book remains important as a text that introduces some of the exciting problems which arise in the biomedical sciences and gives some indication of the wide spectrum of questions that modelling can address. Due to the tremendous development in recent years, this new edition is being published in two volumes. This second volume covers spatial models and biomedical applications. For this new edition, Murray covers certain items in depth, introducing new applications such as modelling growth and control of brain tumours, bacterial patterns, wound healing and wolf territoriality. In other areas, he discusses basic modelling concepts and provides further references as needed. He also provides even closer links between models and experimental data throughout the text. Graduate students and researchers will find this book invaluable as it gives an excellent background from which to begin genuinely practical interdisciplinary research in the biomedical sciences.\"}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Model Selection and Multimodel Inference, A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach', 'abstract': 'We wrote this book to introduce graduate students and research workers in various scienti?c disciplines to the use of information-theoretic approaches in the analysis of empirical data. These methods allow the data-based selection of a “best” model and a ranking and weighting of the remaining models in a pre-de?ned set. Traditional statistical inference can then be based on this selected best model. However, we now emphasize that information-theoretic approaches allow formal inference to be based on more than one model (m- timodel inference). Such procedures lead to more robust inferences in many cases, and we advocate these approaches throughout the book. The second edition was prepared with three goals in mind. First, we have tried to improve the presentation of the material. Boxes now highlight ess- tial expressions and points. Some reorganization has been done to improve the ?ow of concepts, and a new chapter has been added. Chapters 2 and 4 have been streamlined in view of the detailed theory provided in Chapter 7. S- ond, concepts related to making formal inferences from more than one model (multimodel inference) have been emphasized throughout the book, but p- ticularly in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Third, new technical material has been added to Chapters 5 and 6. Well over 100 new references to the technical literature are given. These changes result primarily from our experiences while giving several seminars, workshops, and graduate courses on material in the ?rst e- tion.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Whatever next? Predictive brains, situated agents, and the future of cognitive science', 'abstract': 'Brains, it has recently been argued, are essentially prediction machines. They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing. Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success. This target article critically examines this \"hierarchical prediction machine\" approach, concluding that it offers the best clue yet to the shape of a unified science of mind and action. Sections 1 and 2 lay out the key elements and implications of the approach. Section 3 explores a variety of pitfalls and challenges, spanning the evidential, the methodological, and the more properly conceptual. The paper ends (sections 4 and 5) by asking how such approaches might impact our more general vision of mind, experience, and agency.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Handbook of Adhesion Technology', 'abstract': 'Adhesives have been used for thousands of years, but until 100 years ago, the vast majority was from natural products such as bones, skins, fish, milk, and plants. Since about 1900, adhesives based on synthetic polymers have been introduced, and today, there are many industrial uses of adhesives and sealants. It is difficult to imagine a product—in the home, in industry, in transportation, or anywhere else for that matter—that does not use adhesives or sealants in some manner. The Handbook of Adhesion Technology is intended to be the definitive reference in the field of adhesion. Essential information is provided for all those concerned with the adhesion phenomenon. Adhesion is a phenomenon of interest in diverse scientific disciplines and of importance in a wide range of technologies. Therefore, this handbook includes the background science (physics, chemistry and materials science), engineering aspects of adhesion and industry specific applications. It is arranged in a user-friendly format with ten main sections: theory of adhesion, surface treatments, adhesive and sealant materials, testing of adhesive properties, joint design, durability, manufacture, quality control, applications and emerging areas. Each section contains about five chapters written by internationally renowned authors who are authorities in their fields. This book is intended to be a reference for people needing a quick, but authoritative, description of topics in the field of adhesion and the practical use of adhesives and sealants. Scientists and engineers of many different backgrounds who need to have an understanding of various aspects of adhesion technology will find it highly valuable. These will include those working in research or design, as well as others involved with marketing services. Graduate students in materials, processes and manufacturing will also want to consult it.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Introduction to Discrete Event Systems', 'abstract': 'Introduction to Discrete Event Systems is a comprehensive introduction to the field of discrete event systems, offering a breadth of coverage that makes the material accessible to readers of varied backgrounds.

Distinctive features of the second edition include: more detailed treatment of equivalence of automata, event diagnosis, and decentralized event diagnosis expanded treatment of centralized and decentralized control of partially-observed systems new sections on timed automata with guards (in the Alur-Dill formalism) and hybrid automata an introduction to hybrid systems updated coverage of discrete event simulation, including new software tools available recent developments in sensitivity analysis for discrete event systems as well as hybrid systems This textbook is valuable to advanced-level students and researchers in a variety of disciplines where the study of discrete event systems is relevant: control, communications, computer engineering, computer science, manufacturing engineering, operations research, and industrial engineering.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Fault Detection and Diagnosis in Industrial Systems', 'abstract': 'Early and accurate fault detection and diagnosis for modern chemical plants can minimise downtime, increase the safety of plant operations, and reduce manufacturing costs. The process monitoring techniques that have been most effective in practice are based on models constructed almost entirely from process data. The goal of the book is to present the theoretical background and practical techniques for data-driven process monitoring. Process monitoring techniques presented include: Data-driven methods - principal component analysis, Fisher discriminant analysis, partial least squares and canonical variate analysis; Analytical Methods - parameter estimation, observer-based methods and parity relations; Knowledge-based methods - causal analysis, expert systems and pattern recognition. The text demonstrates the application of all of the data-driven process monitoring techniques to the Tennessee Eastman plant simulator - demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in detail. This aids the reader in selecting the right method for his process application. Plant simulator and homework problems in which students apply the process monitoring techniques to a non-trivial simulated process, and can compare their performance with that obtained in the case studies in the text are included. A number of additional homework problems encourage the reader to implement and obtain a deeper understanding of the techniques. The reader will obtain a background in data-driven techniques for fault detection and diagnosis, including the ability to implement the techniques and to know how to select the right technique for a particular application.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Recommender Systems Handbook', 'abstract': 'The explosive growth of e-commerce and online environments has made the issue of information search and selection increasingly serious; users are overloaded by options to consider and they may not have the time or knowledge to personally evaluate these options. Recommender systems have proven to be a valuable way for online users to cope with the information overload and have become one of the most powerful and popular tools in electronic commerce. Correspondingly, various techniques for recommendation generation have been proposed. During the last decade, many of them have also been successfully deployed in commercial environments. Recommender Systems Handbook, an edited volume, is a multi-disciplinary effort that involves world-wide experts from diverse fields, such as artificial intelligence, human computer interaction, information technology, data mining, statistics, adaptive user interfaces, decision support systems, marketing, and consumer behavior. Theoreticiansand practitioners from these fields continually seek techniques for more efficient, cost-effective and accurate recommender systems. This handbook aims to impose a degree of order on this diversity, by presenting a coherent and unified repository of recommender systems’ major concepts, theories, methodologies, trends, challenges and applications. Extensive artificial applications, a variety of real-world applications, and detailed case studies are included.

This book looks in detail at a wide selection of mathematical models in physiology, showing how physiological problems can be formulated and studied mathematically, and how such models give rise to interesting and challenging mathematical questions. With its coverage of many recent models it gives an overview of the field, while many older models are also discussed, to put the modern work in context. In this second edition the coverage of basic principles has been expanded to include such topics as stochastic differential equations, Markov models and Gibbs free energy, and the selection of models has also been expanded to include some of the basic models of fluid transport, respiration/perfusion, blood diseases, molecular motors, smooth muscle, neuroendrocine cells, the baroreceptor loop, turboglomerular oscillations, blood clotting and the retina. Owing to this extensive coverage, the second edition is published in two volumes. This first volume deals with the fundamental principles of cell physiology and the second with the physiology of systems. The book includes detailed illustrations and numerous excercises with selected solutions. The emphasis throughout is on the applications; because of this interdisciplinary approach, this book will be of interest to students and researchers, not only in mathematics, but also in bioengineering, physics, chemistry, biology, statistics and medicine.

    "title": "Research Landscape Map: Intrinsic Evaluation of LLMs via Behavioral Consistency Checks and Robustness Tests",
    "current_research_landscape": "The research cluster is centered around applying mathematical biology models and information-theoretic approaches to problems within biomedical sciences, emphasizing inference and robust, multimodel statistical methods. The core problem being addressed revolves around developing rigorous ways to evaluate, verify, and interpret complex systems and models—here analogous to intrinsic evaluation of LLMs—through behavioral consistency and robustness. Key conceptual focuses include modeling biological and social phenomena (e.g., wolf territories, bacterial patterns, social order) and developing inference frameworks that balance traditional statistical inference with robust, multimodel, information-theoretic approaches. Hence, the dominant methods are mathematical modeling, information-theoretic inference, multimodel comparison, and robust statistical testing, grounded in applied biomedical contexts from the foundational literature. Three thematic islands emerge: (1) biomedical sciences with spatial and application-driven modeling, (2) information-theoretic and multimodel/statistical inference methods providing robust evaluation frameworks, and (3) sociopolitical constructs of science and knowledge, representing underlying epistemic and social orders of scientific inquiry. Bridge nodes like 'information-theoretic approach' and 'inference' connect these clusters, highlighting the role of inference as a conceptual and methodological bridge between applied modeling and epistemic/social contexts.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps include limited integration of robust multimodel inferential frameworks with practical biomedical applications that can handle the complexity and uncertainty inherent in large, intricate systems such as LLMs; foundational works acknowledge the challenges in moving beyond traditional single-model inference toward true multimodel robustness in real data contexts. Another internal gap is the lack of direct linkage between epistemic/social frameworks ('mysteries of state', 'co-production of science') and computational behavioral tests; i.e., social order and scientific merit concepts remain abstract and disconnected from practical evaluation metrics like behavioral consistency checks. Externally, the 'Global Context & Hidden Bridges' reveal overlooked opportunities: (1) The intersection between biomedical sciences and information-theoretic approaches is enriched by concepts like deep embedded clustering, generative adversarial networks, and learned representations, suggesting that advanced machine learning techniques can be leveraged to improve behavior-based evaluation metrics and robustness in LLMs. (2) The link between biomedical sciences and the sociopolitical 'mysteries of state' concepts suggests the need to incorporate ethical safeguards, socio-legal frameworks, and mental health considerations into intrinsic evaluation paradigms, an aspect absent in current technical evaluations. (3) The connection between information-theoretic approaches and mysteries of state highlights underexplored theoretical grounds such as generalization error analysis, theoretical bounds from VC theory, and learning algorithm behaviors which may inform more principled behavioral consistency checks improving explainability and trustworthiness. These hidden bridges provide rich cross-disciplinary avenues to enrich intrinsic evaluation of LLMs beyond conventional statistics and biomedical modeling.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate advanced machine learning embeddings and generative adversarial frameworks (from the 'biomedical sciences' and 'information-theoretic approach' bridge) with multimodel inference strategies to develop LLM intrinsic evaluation methods that better capture nuanced behavioral consistencies and robustness against adversarial perturbations. This addresses the limitation of current evaluation tools lacking depth in learned representation analysis and robustness testing.\n\nOpportunity 2: Embed ethical, socio-legal, and mental health safeguarding principles (from the 'biomedical sciences' and 'mysteries of state' bridge) into the design of behavioral consistency checks for LLMs. This novel approach aligns evaluation methods with societal impact assessment, addressing critical gaps in social order and co-production theories' absence in intrinsic evaluations.\n\nOpportunity 3: Leverage theoretical advances in generalization error analysis and learning algorithm behavior (from the 'information-theoretic approach' and 'mysteries of state' bridge) to construct explainable, theory-grounded metrics for robustness tests of LLMs. This can provide principled, statistically rigorous evaluation criteria beyond empirical performance, addressing gaps in theoretical underpinning of behavioral consistency validation methods."
