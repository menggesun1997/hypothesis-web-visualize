    "Problem_Statement": "Existing intrinsic evaluation ignores multimodal social and behavioral indicators relevant to quality of life, reducing context sensitivity of LLM metrics.",
    "Motivation": "This idea synthesizes the multidisciplinary quality-of-life framework with computational perplexity to bridge human-centered evaluation and AI intrinsic metrics by integrating multiple data modalities, addressing internal and external gaps.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multimodal evaluation metric combining LLM-generated text perplexity with features extracted from social science-derived quality of life indicators such as survey results, geographic socio-economic data, and behavioral health metrics relevant to the generated content context. Use a fusion model to output a composite intrinsic evaluation score reflecting both computational and human-centered dimensions.",

        "title": "Multimodal Intrinsic Evaluation Merging LLM Perplexity with Social Science-Derived Quality of Life Indicators",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing intrinsic evaluation metrics for large language models (LLMs) predominantly rely on computational measures such as perplexity, which lack sensitivity to rich multimodal social and behavioral indicators related to human quality of life. This gap reduces the contextual relevance and real-world applicability of intrinsic evaluation scores, limiting their ability to reflect meaningful human-centered dimensions.",
        "Motivation": "While traditional LLM intrinsic metrics focus on text-based statistical properties, they insufficiently capture the human-centric, social, and behavioral context pertinent to text generation quality. Incorporating a multidisciplinary quality-of-life framework, derived from social science indicators such as socioeconomic, geographic, and behavioral health data, alongside perplexity, provides a novel and more holistic evaluation paradigm. This research uniquely advances the intrinsic evaluation landscape by developing a rigorously interpretable, multimodal fusion approach that integrates heterogeneous data sources, enhancing evaluation fidelity and bridging computational metrics with responsible AI concerns in natural language processing. This methodological fusion draws inspiration from biomedical informatics and responsible AI principles, establishing a more human-centered benchmark for LLM assessment that is also transparent, interpretable, and replicable.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a detailed multimodal intrinsic evaluation framework that integrates LLM-generated text perplexity scores with quantitatively extracted features from validated social science-derived quality of life indicators (e.g., national survey results on well-being, geographic socio-economic indices, behavioral health statistics) contextualized to the text content domain. Feature extraction includes standardized normalization, temporal alignment by timestamp, and semantic alignment using ontologies such as the WHO Quality of Life framework and geographical metadata linking. We utilize a hierarchical late fusion architecture: initially, modality-specific feature embeddings are generated — perplexity is normalized and scaled; social indicators undergo dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA or autoencoders) and bias-mitigated transformation; then, these embeddings feed into a transparent, interpretable neural fusion model based on attention mechanisms (e.g., multimodal Transformer encoders) to learn cross-modal interactions. The model is trained via supervised regression to predict human expert assessment scores using a labeled dataset of text samples paired with corresponding social indicators. Interpretability is ensured by incorporating attention visualization and feature importance scoring, enabling auditability of which modalities and features drive the final composite score. Prior work such as \"Late Fusion Models in Multimodal Healthcare Informatics\" guides architectural choices, ensuring feasibility and domain alignment. The final composite intrinsic score reflects a robust, human-centered evaluation metric retaining the original meaning of perplexity while enriching it with socially and behaviorally grounded data.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Sourcing aligned multimodal datasets linking textual content with social, geographic, and behavioral indicators: Identify public datasets (e.g., community health surveys, census data) enriched with timestamps and geographic tags.\n2. If gaps exist, apply domain adaptation and data augmentation techniques to simulate missing multimodal links, and explore transfer learning from biomedical datasets as analogues.\n3. Generate LLM text samples contextualized by selected social and behavioral indicators.\n4. Extract and normalize quality of life features; apply dimensionality reduction and confound-bias mitigation.\n5. Compute perplexity scores for generated texts.\n6. Train the hierarchical late fusion model with attention-based interpretability on a dataset labeled by human experts scoring text relevance and contextual alignment.\n7. Evaluate model performance quantitatively against perplexity-only baselines using metrics such as Pearson correlation, RMSE, and statistical significance testing of score improvements.\n8. Validate interpretability via user studies with domain experts.\n9. Perform cross-demographic and cross-geographic generalization tests.\n10. Develop fallback modular integration strategies involving stage-wise evaluation and rule-based fusion heuristics if full fusion proves infeasible within resource constraints.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt concerning equitable access to community mental health services comparing rural and urban populations, referencing geographic and socio-economic indicators.\nExpected Output: The composite intrinsic evaluation score reflects lower perplexity for contextually accurate responses, while the fused score adjusts significantly based on social indicators capturing known disparities, showing enhanced alignment with human expert assessments of social relevance and quality of life sensitivity.\nAdditional test cases include prompts related to pandemic behavioral health impacts and spatially linked poverty indices, demonstrating the model’s ability to integrate cross-modal data and provide interpretable fused scores.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "To address potential data scarcity and alignment challenges, we plan modular fallback strategies: (i) implement separate unimodal intrinsic evaluations with perplexity and social indicator scores computed independently, then fused via transparent rule-based heuristics (e.g., weighted averaging with learned weights from limited labeled data);\n(ii) employ simulation and synthetic data generation to augment sparse modalities;\n(iii) apply incremental integration starting with minimal multimodal fusion and progressively incorporate additional indicators;\n(iv) exploit transfer learning from biomedical and health informatics multimodal fusion models to bootstrap training;\n(v) conduct simulation studies to test fusion mechanisms under controlled data conditions. This ensures the framework’s scalability, feasibility, and adaptability to resource constraints and data availability."
