Since the 1960s two overlapping but fairly distinct research communities and traditions have developed concerning ideas about the quality of life, individually and collectively, one with a fairly narrow focus on health-related issues and one with a quite broad focus. In many ways, the central issues of these fields have roots extending to the observations and speculations of ancient philosophers, creating a continuous exploration by diverse explorers in diverse historic and cultural circumstances over several centuries of the qualities of human existence. What we have not had so far is a single, multidimensional reference work connecting the most salient and important contributions to the relevant fields. Entries are organized alphabetically and cover basic concepts, relatively well established facts, lawlike and causal relations, theories, methods, standardized tests, biographic entries on significant figures, organizational profiles, indicators and indexes of qualities of individuals and of communities of diverse sizes, including rural areas, towns, cities, counties, provinces, states, regions, countries and groups of countries.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Guidelines for the use of flow cytometry and cell sorting in immunological studies (second edition)', 'abstract': 'These guidelines are a consensus work of a considerable number of members of the immunology and flow cytometry community.

Notably, there are comprehensive sections of all major immune cell types with helpful Tables detailing phenotypes in murine and human cells. The latest flow cytometry techniques and applications are also described, featuring examples of the data that can be generated and, importantly, how the data can be analysed. Furthermore, there are sections detailing tips, tricks and pitfalls to avoid, all written and peer-reviewed by leading experts in the field, making this an essential research companion.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Handbook of Research on Science Education', 'abstract': 'Building on the foundation set in Volume I—a landmark synthesis of research in the field—Volume II is a comprehensive, state-of-the-art new volume highlighting new and emerging research perspectives.

This report\\nprovides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation\\nmodels, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics,\\nreasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model\\narchitectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation,\\ntheory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal\\nimpact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and\\nethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep\\nlearning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent\\ncapabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes\\nhomogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution,\\nas the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models\\ndownstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models,\\nwe currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and\\nwhat they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these\\nquestions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will\\nrequire deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their\\nfundamentally sociotechnical nature.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Encyclopedia of Autism Spectrum Disorders', 'abstract': 'This major reference work breaks new ground as an electronic resource for students, educators, researchers, and professionals.

Each thematic section ends with a critical note to foster the fruitful discussion. In addition the final section of the book is dedicated to applications of 4E cognition approaches in disciplines such as psychiatry and robotics.

Today's widely available, sophisticated measuring systems have allowed us to conduct a wealth of new research on facial behavior that has contributed enormously to our understanding of the relationship between facial expression and human psychology. The chapters in this volume present the state-of-the-art in this research. They address key topics and questions, such as the dynamic and morphological differences between voluntary and involuntary expressions, the relationship between what people show on their faces and what they say they feel, whether it is possible to use facial behavior to draw distinctions among psychiatric populations, and how far research on automating facial measurement has progressed.\"}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Encyclopedia of Sciences and Religions', 'abstract': '\"To all who love the God with a 1000 names and respect science” \\xa0 In the last quarter century, the academic field of Science and Theology (Religion) has attracted scholars from a wide variety of disciplines. The question is, which disciplines are attracted and what do these disciplines have to contribute to the debate? In order to answer this question, the encyclopedia maps the (self)-identified disciplines and religious traditions that participate or might come to participate in the Science and Religion debate. This is done by letting each representative of a discipline and tradition answer specific chosen questions. They also need to identify the discipline in relation to the Science and Religion debate. Understandably representatives of several disciplines and traditions answered in the negative to this question. Nevertheless, they can still be important for the debate; indeed, scholars and scientists who work in the field of Science and Theology (Religion) may need knowledge beyond their own specific discipline. Therefore the encyclopedia also includes what are called general entries. Such entries may explain specific theories, methods, and topics. The general aim is to provide a starting point for new lines of inquiry. It is an invitation for fresh perspectives on the possibilities for engagement between and across sciences (again which includes the social and human sciences) and religions and theology. This encyclopedia is a comprehensive reference work for scholars interested in the topic of ‘Science and Religion.’ It covers the widest spectrum possible of academic disciplines and religious traditions worldwide, with the intent of laying bare similarities and differences that naturally emerge within and across disciplines and religions today. The A–Z format throughout affords easy and user-friendly access to relevant information.Additionally, a systematic question-answer format across all Sciences and Religions entries affords efficient identification of specific points of agreement, conflict, and disinterest across and between sciences and religions. The extensive cross-referencing between key words, phrases, and technical language used in the entries facilitates easy searches. We trust that all of the entries have something of value for any interested reader. \\xa0 Anne L.C.

    "current_research_landscape": "The foundational papers emphasize broad thematic coverage of quality of life, qualitative data collection methods, and the role of multidisciplinary scholarly research across social sciences, health, and behavioral domains. The local knowledge skeleton further reveals this research cluster centrally focuses on comprehensive data collection techniques (e.g., SAGE Handbook), varied types of data particularly from digital and online spaces, and multidimensional concepts of quality of human existence across social and geographical strata (e.g., rural areas, groups of countries). The central problem addressed revolves around understanding and measuring complex, multidimensional constructs such as quality of life and human experience through diverse, often qualitative data sources obtained in evolving contexts like online spaces. Dominant methods include qualitative data collection and analysis (with deep attention to types and contexts of data), interdisciplinary frameworks spanning social sciences, health sciences, and sustainable development, and systemic approaches to integrating data from heterogeneous sources to produce meaningful, context-sensitive evaluations.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite extensive methodological resources, the foundational works indicate gaps in fully integrating emergent digital and online data streams into established qualitative data frameworks, limiting adaptability to fast-evolving sociotechnical environments. The local 'groups of countries' node acts as a bridge but signals underexplored cross-country comparative frameworks that effectively marry thematic islands such as digital data collection (online spaces) and quality of human existence. Additionally, the foundational works lack explicit linkage to direct computational metrics, such as those used for intrinsic evaluation of LLMs (e.g., perplexity, self-consistency), indicating a gap in bridging human-centered qualitative evaluations with emerging AI evaluation paradigms. External/Novel Gaps: The global GPS analysis highlights 'hidden bridges' between online spaces and social sciences—especially around topics like digital health initiatives, communities of care, and discourse moves—as well as between social sciences and quality of human existence involving concepts like social support, dignity, and psychosocial distress. These overlooked cross-disciplinary links offer a fertile ground to extend intrinsic LLM evaluation by contextualizing perplexity and self-consistency metrics within richer human experience and behavior models derived from social science and health research. In particular, integrating discourse analysis from online social platforms with systemic quality-of-life constructs could address limitations in current LLM intrinsic evaluation that often lacks holistic context understanding and social impact sensitivity.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Leverage the 'online spaces' and 'social sciences' hidden bridge by integrating discourse moves and digital health concepts with qualitative data collection methods (SAGE Handbook) to develop context-aware intrinsic evaluation metrics for LLMs that reflect real-world social dynamics and usage patterns, thus overcoming limitations in static or decontextualized perplexity measurements.\n\nOpportunity 2: Develop cross-cultural and multi-country evaluation frameworks (bridged by 'groups of countries') that combine social sciences' insights on dignity, psychosocial distress, and social support with intrinsic LLM evaluation metrics. This would enable evaluations sensitive to diverse quality-of-life constructs, improving model fairness and relevance across populations.\n\nOpportunity 3: Create hybrid methodological paradigms connecting the rich qualitative thematic parts of data analysis (including types of data from digital and internet domains) with principled computational uncertainty and self-consistency measures from AI foundation model evaluation. This cross-methodological fusion addresses the internal gap of lacking explicit integration of human-centered evaluative frameworks with AI intrinsic metrics, pushing toward more interpretable and socially grounded LLM assessment tools."
