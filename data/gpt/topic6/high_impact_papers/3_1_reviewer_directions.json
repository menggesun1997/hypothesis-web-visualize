    "title": "Ethically Anchored Behavioral Consistency Metrics for LLMs in Socio-Legal Contexts",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing intrinsic evaluation methods do not incorporate ethical, legal, or mental health considerations, leading to evaluation methods disconnected from societal impact and co-production of science principles.",
    "Motivation": "Filling the external gap linking biomedical sciences to sociopolitical frameworks, this idea innovates by embedding ethical and socio-legal safeguards directly into behavioral consistency checks, creating a socially responsible evaluation paradigm.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a multi-layer evaluation framework that integrates behavioral consistency tests with an ethical constraint layer derived from socio-legal ontologies and mental health impact models. Develop modules that score LLM outputs for alignment with ethical guidelines, socio-legal admissibility, and mental health risk, alongside traditional robustness metrics. Incorporate feedback loops that adjust evaluation weights based on societal impact severity.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate or develop a dataset of text prompts with labeled socio-ethical and legal considerations. 2. Encode these considerations into formal ontologies and scoring algorithms. 3. Deploy existing LLMs and evaluate outputs on combined behavioral and ethical consistency metrics. 4. Benchmark against conventional evaluation methods. 5. Conduct expert review to validate socio-legal relevance of scores.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input prompt: \"Advise a user on managing mental health during a crisis.\" Expected output: High behavioral consistency with zero scores on potential ethical violations or misinformation, ensuring safe and responsible content generation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If formal ontologies are too coarse, integrate crowd-sourced human evaluations to calibrate ethical scores. Alternatively, focus on subsets of ethical domains such as misinformation or privacy for initial validation."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an innovative multi-layer evaluation framework integrating behavioral consistency with ethical constraints; however, the mechanisms for encoding socio-legal ontologies and mental health impact models into operational scoring algorithms lack sufficient clarity and grounding. To enhance soundness, the proposal should specify the formalism for these ontologies, detail how ethical constraints will be quantitatively assessed within LLM outputs, and describe how feedback loops dynamically recalibrate evaluation weights based on societal impact. Without concrete methodological explanations, it is difficult to assess the technical feasibility or rigor of the approach. Enhancing transparency in the method’s inner workings and algorithmic design will significantly strengthen the proposal’s soundness and reproducibility in peer review and later implementation phases, especially given the complexity of integrating ethical, legal, and mental health considerations together with traditional evaluation metrics in LLM assessment frameworks. This clarity is critical to ensure that the approach is realistically operationalizable beyond conceptual novelty and enables focused experimental validation steps subsequently proposed in the plan that depend on these mechanisms functioning as intended. Please provide formal definitions, algorithmic details, and practical examples of the evaluation process and ethical scoring architecture as part of Proposed_Method refinement.

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan ambitiously proposes to curate or develop socio-ethical and legal-labeled datasets, encode them into formal ontologies, and integrate expert reviews. While comprehensive, the plan currently lacks detailed feasibility discussion regarding the dataset creation and ontology formalization — two core pillars that can be major bottlenecks. In particular, acquiring a rich, high-quality dataset annotated with nuanced socio-ethical and legal considerations is a complex and resource-intensive task, likely requiring multidisciplinary expert involvement, which is not thoroughly addressed. Similarly, the strategy for ontology development is underspecified, lacking methodology for capturing socio-legal nuances and mental health risk factors or metrics. It is recommended to incorporate pilot studies or modular validation steps upfront and elaborate on how crowd-sourced calibrations or human-in-the-loop feedback loops will be operationalized to compensate for ontology coarseness, as suggested in the fallback plan. Additionally, clearer criteria for expert review selection, evaluation protocols, and validation metrics should be defined to ensure reproducibility and credibility. Addressing these feasibility concerns with concrete methodological considerations and resource assessments will bolster confidence that the ambitious experimental plan can be realistically and rigorously executed.

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the socially responsible evaluation paradigm focus, the proposal could substantially benefit from explicitly integrating concepts from 'health informatics' and 'user-centered system design' to more holistically bridge biomedical, sociopolitical, and user experience domains. For instance, incorporating health informatics principles could enrich mental health impact assessment modules with clinically validated models and datasets, enhancing reliability and interdisciplinary rigor. Likewise, embedding a human factors or user-centered approach into the ethical evaluation pipeline can operationalize the co-production principle more effectively by facilitating continuous user feedback, adaptability, and transparency of ethical scoring from diverse stakeholder perspectives. Exploring synergy with 'fake news research' might assist in refining misinformation detection and ethical safeguards. Such concrete global integrations will not only strengthen the proposal's impact and novelty but foster broader adoption by illustrating how the framework operates within real-world socio-technical ecosystems, thus advancing the field more meaningfully.
