    "title": "Explainable Ethical Embedding Space Visualizations for Social Bias Diagnostics",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing embedding evaluation lacks explainable visualization tools that clearly map social biases and ethical concerns embedded within LLM representations.",
    "Motivation": "Filling the external gap integrating 'rights concepts' with embedding analysis, we pioneer explainable visualization techniques to make normative semantic embeddings transparent and diagnostically actionable.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a visualization framework that maps ethical and social bias semantic dimensions within embedding spaces using dimensionality reduction tailored to normative semantics. Incorporate interactive tools allowing users to explore embedding neighborhoods, bias clusters, and their semantic interpretations via linked ethical concepts and fairness criteria.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Build normative semantic lexicons for key ethical dimensions.\n2. Extract embeddings and project into bias-sensitive subspaces.\n3. Apply advanced dimensionality reduction (e.g., UMAP with constraints).\n4. Develop interactive visual analytics dashboard.\n5. Validate user interpretability with domain experts.\n6. Demonstrate usage on bias detection in real-world LLM outputs.\n7. Iterate with feedback for improved explainability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Visualization of embeddings for gendered occupational terms.\nExpected Output: Clear bias clusters are revealed, with semantic explanations available for interactive user exploration.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If visualization complexity overwhelms users, implement guided tours or summarize bias insights via natural language anchors."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed experiment plan outlines valuable steps like building normative semantic lexicons and applying constrained UMAP for visualization, but it lacks detail on how key challenges will be addressed. In particular, creating robust normative semantic lexicons is known to be complex due to the subjectivity and cultural variance of ethical concepts; more clarity on methods to ensure lexicon quality and coverage is needed. Additionally, the plan should specify metrics and criteria for validating interpretability and effectiveness of the visualizations, especially when engaging domain experts. To enhance feasibility, the plan should also consider scalability aspects of embedding extraction and dimensionality reduction for large LLMs, and how interactive tools will maintain responsiveness. Incorporating checkpoints for iterative validation and fallback plan deployment based on user testing outcomes would strengthen the scientific rigor and practicality of the experimental workflow. Please elaborate these aspects in the step-by-step plan for stronger feasibility assurance and reproducibility of your framework outputs and human-subject evaluations, which are crucial in this sensitive domain of ethical bias diagnostics and explainability tools integration with LLM embeddings."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the currently social biasâ€“centric framing, enhance the impact and novelty by integrating your explainable ethical embedding visualizations with an application domain from the globally linked concepts, such as electronic health records or diagnosis of depression. For example, embedding representations from patient notes or sensor-based human activity recognition data could be analyzed for hidden social biases or ethical fairness concerns in clinical decision support. This integration would create a novel cross-disciplinary tool that helps diagnose biases not only abstractly in language models but concretely in sensitive healthcare data contexts. Such expansion would increase the broader societal impact by addressing fairness in medical AI applications, attract interdisciplinary interest, and differentiate your work more strongly from existing bias visualization methods that remain limited to generalized NLP embeddings. Explicitly illustrate how your framework can be extended or customized to support normative and fairness analyses in clinical narrative embeddings or sensor data embeddings used in mental health assessment, aligning with ethical principles in healthcare AI."
