        "title": "Dynamic Multi-Agent Biomedical-Inspired Evaluation Suite for Contextual LLM Robustness with Reinforcement Learning Adaptation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic evaluations inadequately integrate multimodel statistical frameworks with biomedical-inspired dynamic contexts and lack adaptive mechanisms to effectively probe complex behaviors and uncertainties in LLM robustness assessment, limiting their ability to simulate real-world system uncertainties and interactions.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work leverages biomedical models and multimodel inference for LLM evaluation, these approaches remain largely static and lack adaptive, interactive mechanisms to simulate complex behavioral dynamics and uncertainties inherent in real-world biomedical contexts. This proposal advances novelty by incorporating multi-agent frameworks to simulate interactions among diverse LLM agents within rich biomedical scenarios, and reinforcement learning to adaptively generate evolving prompts based on LLM responses, thus enabling a dynamic, realistic, and rigorously quantifiable robustness assessment that bridges gaps in existing methodologies.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a dynamic evaluation suite modeling multiple LLMs as interacting agents within biomedical spatial-temporal epidemic spread and treatment scenarios. Each LLM-agent will respond to and influence the evolving scenario states. Reinforcement learning (RL) controllers will adapt prompt sequences in real-time by learning from LLM responses to escalate scenario complexity and exploit detected behavioral weaknesses. Multimodel inference combined with deep learning-based semantic similarity models will quantitatively measure robustness by disentangling semantic variation from system noise in natural language outputs. Statistical tests will incorporate temporal contextual dependencies and agent interaction effects for comprehensive analysis. Expert validation protocols will be systematized using structured evaluation criteria and inter-rater reliability metrics. Computational efficiency will be achieved by selective scenario sampling and data compression techniques, ensuring scalable multimodel aggregation and interpretable uncertainty quantification.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Construct multi-agent biomedical scenarios based on spatial-temporal epidemiological models (e.g., agent-based SIR models) representing interacting entities and disease dynamics.\n2. Instantiate diverse LLM architectures as agents interacting via natural language prompts reflecting scenario states.\n3. Implement RL-based controllers to adaptively generate and modify prompt sequences according to LLM agent feedback, increasing evaluation depth.\n4. Collect and preprocess LLM outputs; apply deep learning semantic embeddings (e.g., transformer-based similarity metrics) to quantitatively distinguish semantic variability from noise.\n5. Apply multimodel statistical frameworks examining spatial-temporal dependencies and agent interactions to evaluate behavioral consistency and uncertainty.\n6. Develop a structured expert validation protocol involving domain specialists, defining evaluation criteria, tasks, and using inter-rater reliability measures to validate semantic accuracy and real-world relevance.\n7. Monitor computational costs and apply scenario sampling and data compression; aggregate multimodel outputs using interpretable ensemble methods.\n8. Iterate experiment cycles to refine prompt adaptation and robustness metrics.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Scenario: Simulated outbreak of a novel infectious disease with interacting patient agents and treatment interventions. LLM-agents provide diagnostic, treatment recommendation, and communication outputs. RL controller adapts prompts based on inconsistencies or uncertainty trends. Successful evaluation results in LLM responses maintaining high consistency and low uncertainty under evolving conditions, verified by domain experts confirming biomedical plausibility and communicative accuracy despite prompt adaptations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If synthetic multi-agent biomedical scenarios or reinforcement-learning driven prompt adaptations fail to induce meaningful behavioral variability or prove infeasible, pivot to leveraging real clinical trial summaries and anonymized patient health records as naturalistic dynamic contexts. Incorporate established deep learning uncertainty estimation methods on these data to sustain rigorous and relevant LLM robustness evaluation."

Specifically, the plan relies heavily on synthetic biomedical scenarios to evaluate LLM robustness but does not clearly address how the spatial-temporal biomedical models will be concretely constructed or validated. The method to quantitatively measure consistency and uncertainty in natural language responses needs more specificationâ€”e.g., how will semantic variation versus system noise be disentangled? Moreover, cross-validation with domain experts is proposed but the mechanism, scope, and criteria for their evaluation remain vague. Elevate feasibility by detailing prompt generation methods, criteria for robust statistical testing, and systematic protocols for expert validation to ensure replicability and scientific rigor in the experiments. Also, anticipate computational costs and clarify how multimodel outputs will be aggregated and interpreted to avoid unmanageable experimental complexity or ambiguous results. Targeting these areas will strengthen experimental feasibility significantly.\n\n\n[FEA-EXPERIMENT] at Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section."

In particular, incorporating multi-agent frameworks could simulate interactions between different LLMs or components as agents within the biomedical context, thereby enriching the behavioral complexity assessed and offering a dynamic evaluation of robustness. Reinforcement learning methods could be applied to adapt prompts based on LLM responses, improving the evaluation suite's capacity to probe weaknesses iteratively. These innovations would help the evaluation move beyond static comparisons towards adaptive, real-world task simulations, boosting relevance and scientific contribution. Such integration would also open pathways to leverage deep learning advances for modeling uncertainty and data-driven scenario generation, addressing feasibility challenges while widening potential impact.\n\n[SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION] at Proposed_Method section."
