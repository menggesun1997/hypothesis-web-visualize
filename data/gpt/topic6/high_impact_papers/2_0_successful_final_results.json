    "title": "ModalSemanticsEmbed: Embedding Representations Aligned with Modal Ontology Structures",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current embedding evaluation methods fail to integrate modal and ontological aspects of knowledge representation, lacking metrics that assess whether embeddings encode modal operators and relations reflective of world structures. Without such integration, embeddings may not capture structured, hierarchical, or normative semantic information critical for meaningful representation.",
    "Motivation": "This project directly addresses the internal gap of insufficient integration between metaphysical/modal structures and empirical embedding evaluation. By bridging modal logic frameworks ('modal questions' and 'modal operators') with embedding space analysis, we pioneer metrics that operationalize ontological semantics, extending beyond statistical similarity to structural semantic fidelity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid framework that maps modal logic operators and relational modal semantics into embedding space construals. Specifically, construct modal logic-guided transformations to generate synthetic datasets of modal relations, and then design embedding evaluation metrics that test for preservation of these modal structures. Introduce 'Modal Relation Preservation Score' (MRPS) to quantitatively assess whether embeddings maintain accessibility relations and modal epistemic states relevant to knowledge hierarchies. Integrate symbolic modal logic processing into the embedding evaluation pipeline, enabling direct comparison of modal relations vis-à-vis geometric embedding distances and directions.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect benchmark datasets with explicit modal semantic annotations (e.g., corpora annotated with necessity, possibility, counterfactuals).\n2. Select pre-trained LLMs (GPT variants, BERT-based models) and extract embedding spaces.\n3. Implement modal relation extraction pipelines and generate synthetic modal relation examples.\n4. Define and compute MRPS for model embeddings.\n5. Compare MRPS with standard embedding similarity metrics and probing results.\n6. Perform ablation studies to examine contribution of modal embedding dimensions.\n7. Validate on downstream tasks requiring modal reasoning (e.g., modal question answering).",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence pair 'It is necessary that all humans are mortal' vs. 'Some humans might be immortal.'\nExpected Output: Embedding pairs represent contrasting modal states where MRPS quantifies preservation of necessity vs. possibility relations; a high MRPS indicates embeddings structurally reflect these modal distinctions.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If modal relation preservation metrics do not outperform existing methods, shift to designing auxiliary tasks that fine-tune embeddings explicitly on modal logic knowledge to improve representation quality. Alternatively, explore graph neural networks to better encode modal accessibility graphs before embedding extraction."

        "title": "ModalSemanticsEmbed+: A Neural-Symbolic Framework for Embedding Modal Ontologies via Graph-Integrated Modal Relation Preservation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current embedding evaluation methods inadequately address the integration of modal and ontological knowledge representations, particularly lacking rigor in mapping symbolic modal operators and accessibility relations into continuous embedding spaces. This gap limits the ability to quantitatively assess whether embeddings capture hierarchical, normative, and epistemic modal structures essential for nuanced semantic understanding. Moreover, existing approaches do not incorporate joint graph-based semantic reasoning frameworks that explicitly model accessibility relations and ontological hierarchies, resulting in limited expressiveness and interpretability in embedding evaluations for modal knowledge.",
        "Motivation": "While embedding evaluation has advanced through statistical and probing techniques, it remains nascent in rigorously integrating modal logic semantics with embedding geometry. Our prior foundation of the Modal Relation Preservation Score (MRPS) highlighted the potential of modal logic-guided metrics but suffered from conceptual under-specification, risking ambiguities in symbolic-to-vector mappings and metric interpretation. This project innovates by formally defining embedding analogues of classical modal operators, grounding MRPS in precise mathematical transformations, and integrating semantic graph reasoning via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent modal ontologies explicitly. With this integrated neural-symbolic semantic reasoning framework, our approach offers a novel, competitive pathway that unifies continuous embedding spaces with discrete modal ontologies for superior semantic fidelity, robustness, and interpretability. Furthermore, by benchmarking MRPS alongside GNN-based modal embeddings, we situate the work at the forefront of neural reasoning and knowledge graph integration, broadening applicability to downstream NLP tasks involving modal inference and human-robot collaboration scenarios requiring modal and epistemic reasoning.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid neural-symbolic framework that: (1) formally defines geometric embedding space operations corresponding to classical modal logic operators—necessity (□) and possibility (◇)—using vector subspace projections, directional offsets, and distance thresholds; specifically, necessity corresponds to projection onto modal subspaces representing invariant properties across accessible worlds, while possibility maps to directional vector expansions capturing alternative epistemic states. (2) Constructs a mathematically-grounded Modal Relation Preservation Score (MRPS) computed via metrics comparing embedding geometry—distances, angles, subspace inclusions—to symbolic accessibility relations drawn from modal logic Kripke frames. (3) Implements an explicit modal ontology graph encoding accessibility relations as edges and world states as nodes, leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn graph-structured neural embeddings that explicitly model modal semantics and ontological hierarchies. (4) Integrates these GNN-based modal embeddings with traditional embedding spaces extracted from pre-trained language models, enabling contrastive benchmarking. (5) Develops algorithms for extracting modal relation triples from natural language corpora and constructs synthetic modal datasets via modal logic-guided transformations for robust evaluation. (6) Implements a hybrid evaluation pipeline that aligns symbolic modal logic structures, GNN-induced graph representations, and continuous embedding geometries under the MRPS metric, enabling comprehensive assessment and interpretability. This approach innovatively merges symbolic modal logic, graph reasoning, and embedding evaluation, surpassing existing statistical or probing-only methods by formalizing symbolic-to-vector mappings and incorporating structured graph semantics relevant to modal and ontological representation. By doing so, it addresses the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty concern by offering a distinct, theoretically grounded, and empirically verifiable neural-symbolic metric and modeling framework. The method also facilitates transfer to NLP and human-robot collaboration tasks demanding advanced modal reasoning capabilities.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Formalize modal operator embeddings: mathematically define embedding space analogues for necessity and possibility operators, specifying vector operations and geometric interpretations derived from modal logic semantics.\n2. Construct modal ontology graphs with annotated accessibility relations using benchmark datasets and ontological knowledge bases.\n3. Design and train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on modal ontology graphs to produce graph-based modal embeddings explicitly encoding accessibility relations and epistemic hierarchies.\n4. Develop synthetic datasets with modal logic-guided transformations representing diverse modal relations (necessity, possibility, counterfactuals).\n5. Implement the Modal Relation Preservation Score (MRPS) as a rigorous metric computing geometric conformity of embeddings (both from traditional LLM embeddings and GNN-based embeddings) to modal relations, incorporating distance thresholds, subspace projections, and angular constraints.\n6. Extract modal relations from natural language corpora using a combination of symbolic modal relation parsers and learned neural classifiers.\n7. Benchmark MRPS across LLM embedding spaces (e.g., GPT, BERT) and GNN-derived modal embeddings to evaluate modal structure preservation, comparing with traditional semantic similarity and probing metrics.\n8. Perform ablation studies to isolate the contribution of modal subspace components and graph neural integration.\n9. Validate the framework on downstream NLP tasks requiring modal reasoning (e.g., modal question answering, counterfactual inference) and human-robot collaboration scenarios requiring intention and epistemic state recognition.\n10. Analyze metric robustness, interpretability, and reproducibility, refining embedding-logic mapping algorithms iteratively.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Two sentences - (a) 'It is necessary that all humans are mortal.' (b) 'Some humans might be immortal.'\nExpected Output: \n- Geometric embedding analysis computes projection of embeddings onto the necessity subspace for (a) and possibility directional expansions for (b).\n- MRPS quantifies high preservation score reflecting correct hierarchical modal relation distinguishing necessity from possibility.\n- GNN-based embeddings explicitly encode differing accessibility graph relations between these modal states.\n- Comparisons to baseline semantic similarity metrics show MRPS’s superior granularity in distinguishing modal semantic nuances.\n- Downstream task evaluation demonstrates improved performance on modal reasoning questions utilizing embeddings with higher MRPS.\nAdditional scenarios include counterfactual conditionals and epistemic modality sentences, validated for embedding geometry consistency and graph structure preservation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "In case the formalized MRPS metric with symbolic-to-embedding mappings or GNN integration does not outperform existing methods, pivot to fine-tuning pre-trained language models on auxiliary tasks explicitly crafted to embed modal logic knowledge, enhancing internal model representation of modal operators via contrastive learning. Additionally, explore alternative neural-symbolic architectures combining rule-based modal logic inference engines with learned neural embeddings to hybridize symbolic rigor with statistical learning. Further fallback options include advanced graph reasoning techniques over knowledge graphs enhanced with modal annotations to indirectly improve embedding expressiveness, and application-driven evaluation to tailor embeddings for targeted downstream tasks necessitating modal reasoning under constrained settings."

However, the mechanism for mapping symbolic modal operators and accessibility relations into continuous embedding spaces lacks clarity and formal definition. Explicit formalization of how modal operators (like necessity, possibility) correspond to geometric transformations or relations in embedding space is necessary to assess soundness. Without this, it remains ambiguous how MRPS quantitatively captures modal structure preservation beyond correlation with semantic similarity. The proposal would benefit from preliminary theoretical grounding or pilot studies illustrating this mapping before full-scale metric development, to solidify the core premise and ensure the method is well reasoned and grounded in both modal logic and embedding geometry principles. Please concretely specify which modal logic operators correspond to what embedding properties (distances, directions, subspaces), and how these are computed and validated within the framework, to avoid ambiguity or under-specification that may risk method soundness and reproducibility in evaluation pipelines, especially given the symbolic-to-vector transition complexity inherent here. This is central for the project’s technical credibility and downstream analysis interpretability, so addressing this would substantially enhance soundness and reviewer confidence in the research approach’s viability and clarity of contribution scope and mechanism design.\n\nTargeted clarifications include: \n- Formal definitions of modal operators’ embedding space analogues.\n- Mathematical or algorithmic description of modal relation extraction and metric computation.\n- Justification of metric’s uniqueness compared to existing embedding evaluation techniques.\n\nThis step is critical before proceeding with downstream experiments or metric benchmarking, ensuring the project’s foundational methodology is solid and reproducible, avoiding risks of conceptual vagueness or oversimplification implicit in symbolic-semantic embedding mappings which could undermine the entire evaluation pipeline’s validity."

Moreover, coupling embeddings with structured graph modalities may open avenues for human-robot collaboration and more robust reasoning frameworks in downstream NLP tasks requiring modal logic inference. \n\nConcretely, you could frame a complementary research direction where MRPS metrics are extended or benchmarked against embeddings produced by models incorporating graph neural representations of modal ontologies. This could improve embedding fidelity and practical reasoning capabilities simultaneously, amplifying impact and novelty beyond current modal logic embedding metric research, grounding the project firmly within state-of-the-art reasoning and neural-symbolic integration trends."
