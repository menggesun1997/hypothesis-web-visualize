    "title": "Integrated Qualitative-Quantitative Framework for Evaluating LLM Response Sensitivity to Psychosocial Distress Indicators",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs lack intrinsic evaluations sensitive to nuanced psychosocial distress signals embedded in online communications, hindering their socially aware deployment.",
    "Motivation": "This framework addresses the internal methodological gap by fusing qualitative distress indicators coding with quantitative uncertainty metrics, thus creating interpretable intrinsic evaluation tools as per the high-potential integration opportunity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a dual-channel evaluation system: (1) a qualitative distress indicator extractor trained on expert-labeled distress cues; (2) standard intrinsic LLM metrics (perplexity, self-consistency). Compute composite scores where high distress signals dynamically influence the interpretation and weighting of perplexity/self-consistency, capturing model sensitivity to human distress.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect distressed message datasets with expert distress annotations.\n2. Build distress cue extractors using linguistic and paralinguistic features.\n3. Generate LLM outputs on distress-related prompts.\n4. Calculate standard intrinsic metrics.\n5. Create composite evaluation weighing intrinsic metrics by detected distress levels.\n6. Validate against human distress sensitivity judgments.\n7. Test system in real-world distress detection and support scenarios.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"I feel hopeless and overwhelmed by work pressure.\"\nExpected Output: The evaluation highlights low perplexity and high self-consistency only if LLM responses appropriately recognize distress and provide accurate supportive content.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If distress extraction underperforms, leverage rule-based distress lexicons and crisis keywords. Consider manual inspection or user feedback integration."

          "feedback_content": "While the concept of combining qualitative distress indicators with quantitative intrinsic LLM metrics is promising, the proposed composite scoring mechanism lacks a clear, detailed description. Specifically, how dynamically weighting perplexity and self-consistency by distress levels will be operationalized, modeled, and validated remains ambiguous. This creates uncertainty about whether the method can reliably capture LLM sensitivity to psychosocial distress signals. Clarify the integration methodology, including equations or algorithms for combining signals and how the weighting adjusts with distress cues, to strengthen soundness and reproducibility of the method, especially given the novelty claims hinging on this fusion approach. Consider potential challenges like balancing subjective qualitative cues with objective intrinsic metrics and how to mitigate biases in distress annotation impacting evaluation scores in the composite metric design, as critical elements needing elaboration here. This will ensure the core mechanism is credible and evaluable by reviewers and practitioners alike, improving confidence in soundness and methodological rigor of the framework as a whole.

          "feedback_content": "The stepwise experiment plan is conceptually coherent but currently insufficiently detailed to fully establish feasibility. For example, it should specify how expert annotations for distress cues will be obtained â€” nature and number of experts, annotation schema, and inter-annotator agreement measures. Building distress cue extractors on linguistic and paralinguistic features requires more clarity about feature selection, modeling approaches (e.g., supervised classifiers, neural architectures), and data scale. Additionally, validation steps (step 6) need to define evaluation metrics and baselines for human distress sensitivity judgments clearly. The fallback plan is a good inclusion but lacks criteria for activation and escalation actions. Given the complexity and challenges of distress annotation and detection, these omissions risk experimental bottlenecks or gaps in replicability. To increase feasibility, provide concrete methodological and resource plans addressing annotation protocols, modeling pipelines, validation benchmarks, and contingency triggers, ideally supported by pilot study results or prior work references where possible.
