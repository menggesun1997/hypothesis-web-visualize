    "title": "Hybrid Qualitative-Computational Framework for LLM Evaluation Grounded in Social Support Constructs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM intrinsic evaluation largely ignores qualitative social constructs such as social support, resulting in assessments that lack social grounding and interpretability with respect to human-centered evaluations.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of poor integration between qualitative thematic analyses (digital data types, social support concepts) and computational uncertainty/self-consistency metrics, leveraging interdisciplinary synthesis as per Opportunity 3.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a framework that transforms qualitative thematic codes of social support from digital communication into computational features. Integrate these with LLM self-consistency measures by weighting uncertainty estimates according to the presence and type of social support expressed. This yields nuanced intrinsic evaluations that reflect human social behavior.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Utilize datasets from online communities annotated for social support (e.g., emotional, informational).\n2. Extract thematic codes using qualitative analysis (SAGE Handbook methods).\n3. Engineer quantitative social support features.\n4. Incorporate features into self-consistency score computation, modulating scores by support presence.\n5. Benchmark against standard intrinsic metrics.\n6. Validate interpretability and alignment with human judgments.\n7. Perform sensitivity analyses.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Feeling overwhelmed by work, what should I do?\"\nExpected Output: LLM responses providing emotional and practical support yield lowered perplexity weighted by social support signaling and higher self-consistency when support is consistently reflected.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If thematic coding is expensive, implement semi-supervised learning to auto-label social support types. Test whether simplified keyword presence can approximate thematic integration."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines transforming qualitative thematic codes of social support into computational features integrated with LLM self-consistency measures by weighting uncertainty estimates. However, the mechanism for this transformation and integration lacks operational clarity. Key aspects such as how thematic codes will be quantitatively encoded, the specific mathematical or algorithmic integration with uncertainty measures, and how weighting will be calculated and optimized remain underdefined. Clarifying these steps with concrete computational methods or model architectures will strengthen methodological soundness and reproducibility, making the approach more convincing and actionable for reviewers and practitioners alike. Consider providing a schematic or pseudo-code outlining the exact pipeline, including feature extraction, weighting criteria, and score combination formulas, to concretize this innovative integration approach in the Proposed_Method section."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and the interdisciplinary nature of this idea, integrating globally-linked concepts can elevate its impact and distinctiveness. Specifically, incorporating insights from 'students’ cognitive processes' and 'mathematics education research' could broaden the framework’s applicability beyond social support in general online communities to educational contexts. For example, extending the framework to analyze LLM responses that support students' cognitive processes during mathematics learning in digital environments could enable tailored, socially grounded AI tutors with interpretable intrinsic evaluation metrics. This synergy can differentiate the contribution by bridging cutting-edge social construct evaluation with pressing educational technology challenges, thus widening impact and attracting cross-disciplinary research attention. Incorporate these connections explicitly as envisioned application areas or future work avenues in the Motivation or Impact discussion."
