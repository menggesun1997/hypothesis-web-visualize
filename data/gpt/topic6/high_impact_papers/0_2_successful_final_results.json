    "title": "Socio-Cognitive Grounding Probes for LLMs Based on Robotic Archaeological Exploration",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current language understanding probes for LLMs lack grounding in embodied cultural knowledge and socio-cognitive contexts, limiting assessment of models’ trustworthiness and reasoning under real-world, material culture-inspired conditions.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap in model evaluation for reasoning and trustworthiness, and the novel opportunity to fuse emergent LLM properties with robotics-driven data acquisition, by synthesizing culturally and historically grounded socio-cognitive probes derived from robotic exploration of material artifacts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Deploy autonomous robots to explore archaeological sites, collecting multi-modal sensor data and contextual metadata. Translate these experiences into language model probes that demand socio-cognitive processing—inferring ritualistic, societal, or symbolic meaning—reflective of the artifacts' cultural roles. Integrate these probes into LLM benchmarking suites to measure deeper understanding and emergent reasoning capabilities.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop robotic exploration strategy for archaeological sites recording sensor data and environmental context.\n2. Collect curated multimodal datasets aligned with specific cultural hypotheses (e.g., ritual significance).\n3. Annotate datasets with expert socio-cognitive interpretations.\n4. Construct LLM prompts that require integrating multi-modal knowledge and reasoning.\n5. Evaluate LLMs on these probes with metrics for cultural coherence, reasoning chains, and confidence calibration.\n6. Contrast results with traditional benchmarking datasets lacking socio-cognitive grounding.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Robot-collected sensor data from a burial urn associated with funerary rites. Probe: \"Based on the shape, material, and location, infer the sociocultural beliefs reflected in this artifact's use.\" Output: LLM provides a historically grounded interpretation discussing ritualistic burial customs and societal values inferred from the data.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If socio-cognitive grounding is too difficult initially, start with simpler cultural context probes derived from static multi-modal datasets. Also, introduce incremental complexity in probe design, moving from descriptive to interpretive questions as model capabilities improve."

        "title": "Socio-Cognitive Grounding Probes for LLMs via Participatory Robotic Archaeological Exploration and Human-Centered Cultural Heritage Collaboration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing language understanding probes for large language models (LLMs) largely lack grounding in embodied, culturally rich, and socio-cognitive contexts, which constrains meaningful evaluation of models' trustworthiness and reasoning abilities in real-world scenarios centered on material culture. Moreover, current probing approaches often overlook participatory and ethical dimensions that reflect authentic cultural experiences and knowledge from affected communities.",
        "Motivation": "To bridge a critical gap in LLM evaluation by designing socio-cognitive probes grounded in embodied cultural knowledge obtained through a novel interdisciplinary methodology that fuses autonomous robotic archaeological data acquisition with participatory, human-centered design involving cultural heritage organizations and indigenous communities. This collaboration enhances novelty by ensuring benchmark authenticity, inclusivity, and trustworthiness beyond technical metrics, responding to recent calls for AI evaluation aligned with human values and cultural heritage preservation principles. Our approach uniquely integrates robotics, socio-cognitive interpretation, and participatory design to create culturally validated, multi-modal LLM probes that advance assessment of emergent reasoning under materially and socially grounded conditions.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a staged, interdisciplinary framework starting with pilot studies on publicly available multi-modal archaeological datasets to develop rigorous annotation protocols with cultural heritage experts and anthropologists, ensuring strong inter-annotator agreement and interpretive rigor. Building on this foundation, we will co-design socio-cognitive probing tasks through participatory design workshops with cultural heritage organizations, indigenous communities, and human-computer interaction (HCI) experts to embody authentic, community-endorsed cultural narratives and ethical considerations. Autonomous robotic exploration of archaeological sites will be carefully planned with cultural heritage stakeholders to respect site fragility and permissions, using robotic simulations and controlled environments prior to any field deployment for risk mitigation. The collected multi-modal data (sensor suites, environmental context) will be contextualized using socio-cognitive frameworks co-developed with interdisciplinary collaborators. We will operationalize evaluation metrics focused on cultural coherence, reasoning chain validity, and confidence calibration, leveraging human-centered AI theory to interpret results responsibly. Finally, the resulting probes will be integrated into LLM benchmarking suites that reflect human values and heritage preservation priorities, setting a new standard for responsible, inclusive AI evaluation in socio-cultural domains.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Conduct pilot analyses using publicly available multi-modal archaeological datasets to develop annotation guidelines and assess inter-annotator reliability among anthropologists, archaeologists, and cultural heritage experts.\n2. Establish formal interdisciplinary collaboration involving archaeologists, anthropologists, HCI researchers, cultural heritage organizations, and indigenous representatives, defining ethical and participatory research protocols.\n3. Facilitate participatory design workshops to co-create socio-cognitive probe concepts and benchmark objectives ensuring cultural sensitivity and community validation.\n4. Develop and test simulation environments for robotic exploration to minimize risks and validate data collection methods prior to physical deployment.\n5. Secure necessary permissions and plan respectful, minimally invasive robotic deployments under close supervision where feasible, or rely on curated static datasets if deployment is not currently practical.\n6. Collect and annotate robot-acquired or curated multi-modal data with expert socio-cognitive interpretations following established protocols, emphasizing rigorous consensus-building.\n7. Create LLM prompt sets requiring integration of multi-modal information and socio-cognitive reasoning grounded in cultural narratives co-designed with stakeholders.\n8. Define and apply detailed, human-centered evaluation metrics for cultural coherence, reasoning traceability, and confidence calibration, with continuous feedback loops involving stakeholder review.\n9. Compare model performance on these new socio-cognitive grounding probes against traditional benchmarks lacking this cultural and human-centered embedding to demonstrate enhanced evaluative power.\n10. Disseminate findings alongside open-source benchmarking suite with documentation of participatory processes and cultural ethical considerations to promote reproducibility and adoption.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multi-modal sensor data (visual, material composition, spatial context) collected from a simulated robotic survey of a decorated ceremonial pottery vessel from a heritage repository, annotated with community-endorsed narratives about its cultural use.\nProbe: \"Considering the artifact's design patterns, material, and archaeological context, infer and articulate the sociocultural meanings and ritual significance recognized by the associated community.\"\nOutput: The LLM generates an interpretation that aligns with the co-designed cultural narratives, describing symbolic patterns, associated rituals, and societal beliefs, while transparently indicating uncertainty and reasoning paths, reflecting both historical and community contexts.\nFurther, stakeholder feedback confirms the response's cultural appropriateness and interpretive validity as per participatory design outcomes.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should initial autonomous robotic deployment prove unfeasible due to site constraints or permissions, we will rely entirely on rich, publicly available multi-modal archaeological datasets and heritage archives co-annotated with experts and communities. We will iteratively increase probe complexity from descriptive (artifact attributes) to interpretive (socio-cognitive significance) tasks, continuously engaging collaborators to validate annotations and participant relevance. Simulation-based robotic data generation and virtual environments will supplement real-world data to sustain embodied reasoning aspects without physical risks. Robust evaluation metric operationalization and participatory validation processes will remain central to maintain rigor and authenticity throughout scaling and adaptation phases."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while ambitious and well-structured, underestimates the practical challenges associated with deploying autonomous robots in archaeological sites, including permissions, fragility of sites, and data reliability. Moreover, the plan assumes expertise availability for socio-cognitive annotations without specifying how to ensure inter-annotator agreement or rigor in cultural interpretation. To improve feasibility, the authors should carefully integrate interdisciplinary collaboration workflows with archaeologists and anthropologists early on, include risk mitigation strategies around robotic deployment, and propose pilot studies on publicly available multi-modal archaeological datasets before full autonomous exploration. This phased approach can better validate data collection and annotation workflows before scaling up to autonomous robotic deployment in sensitive field environments, thus increasing the practicality and scientific soundness of the experiment plan. The proposal also would benefit from more detailed operationalization of metrics for cultural coherence and confidence calibration to ensure evaluations are reliable and interpretable in context of socio-cognitive reasoning assessment.  Targeting these feasibility concerns will strengthen the viability and reproducibility of the research method as currently outlined in the Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan sections, making the ambitious goals more attainable and scientifically rigorous in execution and evaluation phases.  This step is critical before expecting meaningful benchmark integration or impact demonstration in LLM evaluation frameworks. For example, outlining specific collaborations, permissions procedures, or simulation environments could make the plan more grounded and actionable for the research team and reviewers alike, moving beyond a high-level vision to an executable research agenda within a realistic timeline and resource scope of state-of-the-art robotics and cultural heritage institutions involved in field work.  This feedback primarily targets the robustness and practical planning in the Experiment_Plan section, which underpins the entire methodological soundness and feasibility of the proposal's core mechanisms and impact realization prospects.  Therefore, focusing on resolving these feasibility and operational gaps should be a priority initial step for the Innovator to increase the chance of successful, well-grounded execution, acceptance, and impact of this promising research idea.  A stronger articulation of these plans will also address evaluability concerns raised by the novelty screening and peer competition in this multidisciplinary, technically complex domain of socio-cognitive probing with embodied AI modalities and cultural heritage data acquisition methods that are still emergent and exploratory in real-world deployments at scale.  Overall, feasibility clarity is essential to complement the innovative concept and avoid conceptual overreach at early stages that could jeopardize subsequent validation, benchmarking, and impact demonstrations that reviewers and funders will critically examine.  This feedback relates specifically to Sections 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' and also has ramifications on the viability of 'Proposed_Method'.  Actionable suggestions include detailed risk assessment, staged pilot study inclusion, interdisciplinary collaboration protocols, and metric operationalization for evaluation.  These considerations are especially pressing given the complexity, novelty, and multi-disciplinary nature of the proposed approach involving autonomous robotics, socio-cultural interpretation, and LLM evaluations in tandem, as presented in your work.  We encourage addressing these feasibility dimensions explicitly as a foundation to maximize research success and meaningful contribution to understanding and benchmarking LLM socio-cognitive grounding capabilities through archaeological exploration probes.  The authors should accordingly revise these sections to include concrete operational detail and practical constraints mitigation strategies to enhance confidence in project deliverability and scientific rigor from this critical feasibility perspective.  This focus will empower reviewers, collaborators, and stakeholders with clearer expectations and pathway for viable implementation aligning tightly with stated innovation intentions, making your compelling vision more actionable and credible when advanced to later stages of research and deployment.  This is a high-leverage improvement area based on current proposal content that hinges substantially on successful experimental design execution, corroborated data quality, and interpretive annotation rigor in realistic contexts but presently lacks the robustness of detail and risk awareness necessary for confidence in feasibility and soundness of methodology.  Addressing this will help protect the research effort from avoidable early failures or delays inherent in pioneering robotic socio-cognitive dataset curation in archaeological environments and improve chances of impactful evaluation results essential for this project's contribution to LLM trustworthiness and reasoning assessments under materially grounded cultural knowledge conditions.  Therefore, the authors must carefully revisit and substantially enrich these experimental feasibility aspects per above suggestions before further development or dissemination beyond initial novelty approval phases to ensure both scientific and practical robustness required for this complex interdisciplinary endeavor.  Ultimately, this strengthens the research foundation to support anticipated benchmark impact and integrative potential across linguistics, robotics, cultural heritage studies, and AI fields targeted by this innovative probing initiative naturally derived from the proposal's articulated vision and goals, positioning it for broader acceptance and influence in the research community.  Thanks for considering this in your revisions and future project planning endeavors to enhance research viability and impact realization potential significantly, as reflected in the proposal’s 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' and corresponding 'Proposed_Method' sections targeted here specifically for constructive actionable improvement at this preliminary stage of your research proposal development cycle.
