        "title": "Living Multi-Domain Intrinsic Benchmarking Environment for Cultural and Linguistic Dynamicity with Multi-Agent Autonomous Sensing and Affective Cognition",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic benchmarking frameworks for large language models (LLMs) predominantly rely on static, narrow-scope datasets that inadequately capture the continually evolving nature of cultural knowledge, linguistic diversity, and interpretive frameworks. This leads to limited evaluations of LLMs' robustness, adaptability, and interpretability in real-world, dynamic, and socially situated contexts.",
        "Motivation": "To transcend existing limitations, this research proposes an innovative, continuously updating benchmarking ecosystem that integrates multi-agent autonomous robotic sensing with dynamic encyclopedic and cultural knowledge bases, augmented by affective computing and complex systems modeling via Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. This interdisciplinary approach not only captures the temporal evolution and nuanced social-emotional dimensions of cultural knowledge but also enables scalable, decentralized, and adaptive intrinsic evaluation metrics for LLMs. This addresses a critical innovation gap by combining distributed AI, autonomous robotics, and cognitive interpretability modeling to produce a uniquely rich and evolving evaluation environment substantially surpassing static benchmarks in novelty and real-world relevance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We will build a distributed multi-agent system comprising networked autonomous robots collecting synchronized multimodal archaeological and environmental data streams across diverse cultural sites. These agents collaboratively perform decentralized data fusion and knowledge synthesis, feeding into an adaptive benchmarking platform. This platform continuously integrates live encyclopedic updates and applies Fuzzy Cognitive Maps to model and dynamically represent evolving cultural knowledge and interpretive biases enriched by affective computing models that encode human cultural affective responses. Automatic probe generation algorithms employ this cognitively and socially grounded framework to create contextually relevant, nuanced intrinsic evaluation challenges that assess LLMs' adaptability, interpretability, and social-emotional reasoning over time. Modular APIs with standardized data schemas enable transparent integration and iterative prototype validation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop and deploy multiple networked autonomous robotic agents equipped with multimodal sensors (visual, geometric, spectral) across selected archaeological sites, establishing robust, fault-tolerant data pipelines with formal data schemas.\n2. Design decentralized fusion algorithms for synchronized agent data streams, incorporating uncertainty quantification and noise mitigation.\n3. Integrate APIs for dynamic encyclopedic and cultural knowledge base updates, ensuring semantic alignment via standardized ontologies.\n4. Construct Fuzzy Cognitive Map models reflecting evolving cultural knowledge and interpretive biases, incorporating affective computing measurements derived from human feedback datasets.\n5. Develop and iteratively refine automatic probe generation algorithms that merge decentralized sensor knowledge, fuzzy cognitive cultural models, and affective dimensions.\n6. Establish evaluation metrics for probe relevance, semantic coherence, adaptability challenge levels, and social-emotional interpretive complexity.\n7. Pilot prototype phases: (a) Single-agent offline simulations with synthetic datasets; (b) Multi-agent system in controlled environments; (c) Live multi-agent deployment with real-time encyclopedic integration.\n8. Conduct periodic LLM evaluations against evolving probe sets, benchmarking improvements over static datasets.\n9. Implement contingency protocols including synthetic data augmentation, simulated environments, and batch update modes if real-time streaming fails.\n10. Collect multi-disciplinary expert feedback to systematically validate probe quality and platform effectiveness, informing staged incremental platform maturation and resource planning.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multimodal sensor streams from a networked robotic agent cluster capturing newly excavated artifact imagery, spatial context, and environmental metadata, synchronized and fused with latest updated archaeological theory and cultural sentiment data from encyclopedic sources and affective human responses.\nGenerated Probe Example: \"Analyze how recent fuzzy cognitive map-based modeling of the artifact's symbolic motifs, combined with recorded human affective responses, challenges previous cultural interpretations and discuss implications for the regional historical timeline and social narratives.\"\nExpected Output: The LLM produces an updated reasoning chain integrating multisource cultural knowledge and affective dimensions, demonstrating improved contextual adaptability, interpretability, and sensitivity to socio-emotional nuances.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should real-time multi-agent deployment or continuous encyclopedic integration prove infeasible initially, the system will pivot to simulated multi-agent environments and batch update protocols, using synthetically generated multimodal datasets and fuzzy cognitive cultural models to emulate evolving contexts. This will enable progressive validation of probe generation algorithms and LLM evaluation metrics in a controlled setting. Parallel efforts will focus on refining data schemas, API stubs, and modular software components for smooth transition to live operation. Additionally, synthetic augmentation and offline expert-curated temporal snapshots serve as intermediate benchmarks to maintain project momentum and ensure concept viability until full system integration and live deployment milestones are achievable."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines an ambitious integration of autonomous robotic sensors with dynamic encyclopedic updates and automatic probe generation. However, it lacks detailed technical feasibility analysis for key challenges: the robustness and reliability of real-time sensor data pipelines, the semantic alignment between multimodal archaeological sensory input and diverse encyclopedia knowledge, and the complexity of designing algorithms that can accurately merge these data streams into meaningful, contextually relevant probes. There is also insufficient discussion on computational and resource requirements, timeline for iterative refinement cycles, and contingency handling for data noise or inconsistencies. Strengthening this plan with feasibility milestones, clearer modularization of system components, validation strategies for probe quality, and fallback methods beyond batch updates (e.g., simulated environments or synthetic data generation) would enhance confidence in the proposed platform's practical realization and evaluative rigor. Recommend elaboration on these aspects in the experiment plan to demonstrate systematic, staged feasibility assessment and incremental risk mitigation mechanisms early on to match the project’s technical complexity and scope constraints. This will also help reviewers and funders gauge realistic expectations and resource commitments for platform deployment and maintenance over time. Target your next refinement round here to reduce uncertainty and highlight achievable intermediate goals that validate key hypothesis through prototype experiments or pilot studies before full integration attempts. Include detailed data schemas, API specs, and evaluation metrics for real-time adaptive probe generation effectiveness and reliability to improve transparency and reproducibility potential of the experimental setup. This will directly address feasibility concerns raised by the ambitious methodology linking disparate live data domains and dynamic knowledge bases into one coherent intrinsic benchmarking environment for LLMs.  \n\nProposed Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating and to increase novelty and impact, consider integrating concepts from 'multi-agent systems' and 'autonomous robots' more explicitly by enabling a networked collaboration among multiple robotic exploration agents contributing synchronized multimodal data streams and performing decentralized knowledge synthesis. Coupling this with 'affective computing' elements—such as modeling human cultural affective responses or interpretive biases—could enable richer, more nuanced intrinsic probes evaluating LLMs’ capability to adapt to and interpret evolving cultural contexts under social-emotional dimensions. Also, employing 'Fuzzy Cognitive Maps' for dynamic modeling of cultural knowledge evolution may provide interpretable, mathematically grounded representations integrated into the automated probe generation. This cross-pollination would increase interdisciplinary innovation by leveraging distributed AI concepts and complex systems modeling, pushing beyond a single-robotic-sensor pipeline into a scalable, adaptive ecosystem benchmarking environment more reflective of real-world cultural and linguistic dynamics. Explicitly outlining and prototyping such integrations in future iterations can elevate the platform’s uniqueness and relevance for ACL/NeurIPS communities interested in robust, context-aware language model evaluation frameworks allied with autonomous sensing and cognition-inspired computational structures. \n\nProposed Section: Proposed_Method"
