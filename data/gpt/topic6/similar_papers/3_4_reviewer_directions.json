    "title": "Longitudinal Behavioral Consistency Modeling with Graph Neural Temporal Embeddings",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing intrinsic evaluations largely focus on acute model validations without capturing longitudinal or chronic behavioral consistency of LLMs over extended temporal or contextual shifts, resulting in poor assessment of model stability over time.",
    "Motivation": "This project targets the internal gap of translating acute validations into chronic performance assessments by leveraging temporal graph neural networks to model behavioral trajectories of LLM responses over time or sequential contexts, innovatively bridging gaps across dynamic data domains.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct time-evolving behavioral graphs where nodes represent model outputs at different timepoints or contexts, and edges encode temporal transitions or semantic shifts. Train temporal graph neural networks to learn embeddings capturing longitudinal consistency patterns. Introduce metrics based on trajectory smoothness, drift detection, and robustness to evolving inputs. Integrate with existing intrinsic evaluation metrics for comprehensive chronic robustness assessment.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect longitudinal LLM output data subjected to sequential contextual prompts.\n2. Build temporal graphs representing output trajectories.\n3. Implement temporal GNN models (e.g., dynamic GCNs, temporal attention networks).\n4. Train models to predict longitudinal consistency and detect abrupt behavioral changes.\n5. Benchmark against static evaluation methods.\n6. Validate robustness on synthetic and real-world domain shift datasets.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sequential prompts related to medical diagnosis evolving with additional symptoms over time.\nExpected Output: Temporal graph embeddings reveal stable behavioral patterns with low drift scores indicating high longitudinal consistency.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If temporal GNNs underperform, explore recurrent neural networks on graph embeddings or contrastive learning for longitudinal consistency. Alternatively, apply smoothing or filtering techniques to mitigate noise in behavioral trajectories."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines leveraging temporal graph neural networks to model longitudinal consistency through behavioral trajectories, but it lacks clarity on how temporal edges and semantic shifts will be quantitatively defined and differentiated. More explicit mechanistic details are needed regarding the construction of the graphs, specifics on node and edge feature design, and how temporal dynamics will be captured and utilized within the GNN architecture. Strengthening this section by including concrete modeling frameworks and justifications would solidify the soundness of the approach and support reproducibility and understanding by reviewers and future implementers. Consider also discussing potential limitations or assumptions inherent in temporal GNN modeling for this domain to demonstrate a rigorous analytical foundation in the mechanism design, beyond high-level conceptual descriptions (e.g., why chosen temporal GNN variants are appropriate). This will ensure that the methodology is well-reasoned and practically executable, addressing the soundness criterion more robustly, especially in a competitive research landscape where clear novelty and rigor are essential to distinguish contributions from prior work in dynamic graph learning and LLM behavioral analysis.

          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty screening assesses this idea as NOV-COMPETITIVE, the project would benefit from integrating domain-relevant applications linked to globally impactful areas such as 'automated depression detection' and 'suicide prevention,' where longitudinal behavioral consistency of LLMs is critical. For example, framing or extending the modeling framework to track LLM-assisted assessments or conversational agents in mental health contexts could significantly boost societal impact and practical relevance. Embedding the proposed temporal graph embeddings within health data science to monitor and detect shifts in decision-making or behavioral consistency over extended interactions may differentiate this work strongly. Such integration would harness the potential of long-term memory modeling and intelligent decision-making concepts already closely aligned with the temporal nature of the approach and address gaps in chronic condition monitoring or prevention strategies. This multi-disciplinary linkage may also catalyze novel datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation scenarios, elevating the project's competitiveness and real-world utility.
