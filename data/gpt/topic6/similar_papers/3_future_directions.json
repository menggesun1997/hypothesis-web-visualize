        "title": "Graph-Integrated Behavioral Consistency Networks for LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic evaluation methods for LLMs struggle with expressing behavioral consistency across diverse input perturbations due to lack of structured representation of input variations and model responses. This limits the ability to robustly assess model reliability and generalization in intrinsic evaluation.",
        "Motivation": "This project directly addresses the critical gap of bridging methodological approaches by introducing graph neural networks (GNNs) as a structural encoding tool that can systematize behavioral consistency checks. It leverages the hidden bridge opportunity by integrating GNNs from biomedical engineering to encode and compare varied behaviors of LLMs, making intrinsic evaluation more generalizable and interpretable.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel evaluation framework where LLM behavioral outputs under multiple perturbations are encoded as nodes in a graph, with edges representing semantic or syntactic similarity of input prompts. A graph neural network is trained to learn embeddings of behavioral consistency patterns, enabling quantitative assessment of model robustness and revealing latent inconsistency clusters. This graph-structured behavioral data representation is coupled with traditional intrinsic metrics, forming a hybrid evaluation framework.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect benchmark datasets of LLM inputs with designed perturbations (e.g., paraphrasing, adversarial noise).\n2. Obtain LLM outputs and construct behavioral graphs encoding relationships among input variants and their outputs.\n3. Train GNN models to embed these graphs and predict robustness scores.\n4. Evaluate against baselines using standard intrinsic metrics (e.g., perplexity, consistency rate).\n5. Analyze correlation and complementary insights between GNN embeddings and traditional measures.\n6. Test generalization on multiple LLM architectures and domains.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Original prompt \"What is the capital of France?\" and perturbed inputs \"France's capital?\", \"Which city is the capital of France?\", \"Capital city of France?\"\nExpected Output: Behavioral graph with nodes representing each prompt's LLM response embedding, edges representing semantic similarity of prompts; GNN predicts a high behavioral consistency score indicating robust performance across variations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If GNN embeddings do not correlate well with intrinsic evaluation metrics, fallback to simpler graph metrics (e.g., node centrality, clustering coefficients) to capture behavioral patterns. Alternatively, incorporate attention-based models that weigh influence of perturbations on output variance, or explore transformer-based graph neural architectures."

        "title": "QSAR-Driven Intrinsic Evaluation for Language Model Toxicity Prediction",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLMs increasingly generate outputs with potentially toxic content, yet intrinsic evaluation methods lack robust behavioral and biological analogy metrics rooted in chemical hazard assessment, limiting the ability to predict and understand model toxicity across domains and longitudinally.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the external gap identified by leveraging QSAR modeling—commonly used in toxicology—to enhance intrinsic evaluation of LLMs by analogically modeling toxicity-related output behaviors. It proposes a novel cross-disciplinary synthesis to assess toxicity consistency and robustness in language output, inspired by chemical structure-activity relationships.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a QSAR-like computational pipeline where LLM-generated textual outputs are encoded with structural linguistic features (syntax tree patterns, semantic polarity markers, and lexical toxicity indicators). These features form 'chemical-like' descriptors that feed into predictive QSAR models adapted from chemistry to estimate inherent toxicity risks and behavioral consistency under perturbations or contextual shifts. This hybrid metric offers a systematic, predictive intrinsic evaluation of toxicity risks in LLM behavior.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate datasets of LLM outputs labeled for toxicity across multiple prompt types.\n2. Extract structural linguistic descriptors mimicking chemical features used in QSAR.\n3. Train QSAR-inspired predictive models using these descriptors to estimate toxicity scores.\n4. Evaluate model robustness over perturbations and contextual changes.\n5. Benchmark against standard toxicity evaluation measures.\n6. Test on multiple LLMs and toxicological datasets for generalizability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt \"Tell me about minority groups.\" with variations including neutral, sensitive, and adversarial forms.\nExpected Output: QSAR-based toxicity risk scores predict higher risk on adversarial inputs, consistent across perturbations, revealing model fragility or robustness in toxicity behavior.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If linguistic descriptors alone inadequately capture toxicity, integrate external knowledge graph embeddings of toxic concepts or use multimodal QSAR combining image and text toxicity features. Alternatively, incorporate reinforcement learning feedback loops to refine predictor models."

        "title": "Unified Cross-Domain Framework for Intrinsic Evaluation via Multi-modal Graph Representations",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluation methods in neuroimaging and predictive toxicology operate largely in silos, lacking a unified, method-agnostic framework that can robustly evaluate intrinsic consistency and robustness across heterogeneous biological data and modeling paradigms.",
        "Motivation": "Directly addressing the internal gap of missing integrative bridge nodes and cross-domain synergies, this research proposes a unified intrinsic evaluation framework that fuses structure-based computational models with current domain-specific pipelines through multi-modal graph representations. This synthesis could substantially improve the robustness and generalizability of evaluation methods across complex biological data modalities.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a framework that encodes diverse input-output pairs from neuroimaging, toxicology, and LLM behavioral datasets into a universal graph format. Nodes represent states, inputs, or model predictions; edges encode relationships, similarities, or temporal transitions. A multi-modal graph neural network processes these graphs to learn shared latent representations indicative of intrinsic consistency and robustness across domains. The framework supports plug-and-play with domain-specific pipelines and outputs unified evaluation metrics.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Aggregate datasets from neuroimaging, toxicology, and LLM behavior consistency tasks.\n2. Define unified graph construction rules capturing domain-specific and cross-domain relationships.\n3. Implement multi-modal GNN architectures capable of heterogeneous data handling.\n4. Train the framework to predict robustness and consistency metrics across tasks.\n5. Compare unified metrics with standard evaluations in each domain.\n6. Conduct ablation studies analyzing domain contributions and integration benefits.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Combined data from a longitudinal brain imaging study and chemical hazard model outputs encoded jointly as graphs.\nExpected Output: Unified robustness score reflecting model stability tested longitudinally and across biological heterogeneity domains, outperforming domain-isolated metrics.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-modal fusion is unstable, fallback to domain-specific GNN models with later stage feature fusion via ensemble methods. Investigate dimensionality reduction techniques or domain adaptation algorithms to facilitate integration."

        "title": "Chemical-Structural Prompt Encoding for Robust LLM Consistency Evaluation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Standard prompt perturbation methods for behavioral consistency evaluation in LLMs overlook the structural analogies of chemical compounds that could inform more systematic and interpretable robustness tests, limiting evaluation fidelity.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the hidden bridge linking QSAR and chemical feature encoding to toxicological predictive models, this idea introduces chemical-structural analogs as a novel prompt encoding scheme. It fills the gap of lacking methods bridging distinct paradigms by translating chemical similarity concepts into prompt design for more meaningful intrinsic evaluation of LLMs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create a prompt encoding framework where input texts are represented via graph-based chemical structure analogs—encoding syntactic subcomponents as 'molecular fragments' with relational bonds reflecting linguistic dependencies. Generate perturbations by manipulating these fragments similarly to chemical modifications, enabling systematic and interpretable behavioral consistency testing. Evaluate LLM outputs against these chemically inspired prompt variations to assess robustness and intrinsic consistency.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop algorithms to convert sentences into chemical-structure-like graph encodings.\n2. Design perturbation operations analogous to chemical substitutions.\n3. Apply these to generate perturbation datasets for multiple LLMs.\n4. Measure model behavioral consistency and interpret robustness patterns.\n5. Compare with traditional random or paraphrasing perturbation methods.\n6. Analyze interpretability gains and correlation with toxicity or bias metrics.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence \"The patient showed symptoms of fever.\" encoded as a chemical fragment graph.\nPerturbation: Substituting 'fever' fragment with 'cough' akin to chemical substitution.\nExpected Output: LLM outputs reflecting consistent medical reasoning under systematic fragment changes, with robustness quantified by chemical-analog metrics.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If chemical analog encoding proves too coarse, refine branch and bond representations with dependency parse graphs or semantic role labels. Alternatively, develop hybrid encoding combining chemical analogies with attention weights to capture subtle linguistic variations."

        "title": "Longitudinal Behavioral Consistency Modeling with Graph Neural Temporal Embeddings",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing intrinsic evaluations largely focus on acute model validations without capturing longitudinal or chronic behavioral consistency of LLMs over extended temporal or contextual shifts, resulting in poor assessment of model stability over time.",
        "Motivation": "This project targets the internal gap of translating acute validations into chronic performance assessments by leveraging temporal graph neural networks to model behavioral trajectories of LLM responses over time or sequential contexts, innovatively bridging gaps across dynamic data domains.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct time-evolving behavioral graphs where nodes represent model outputs at different timepoints or contexts, and edges encode temporal transitions or semantic shifts. Train temporal graph neural networks to learn embeddings capturing longitudinal consistency patterns. Introduce metrics based on trajectory smoothness, drift detection, and robustness to evolving inputs. Integrate with existing intrinsic evaluation metrics for comprehensive chronic robustness assessment.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect longitudinal LLM output data subjected to sequential contextual prompts.\n2. Build temporal graphs representing output trajectories.\n3. Implement temporal GNN models (e.g., dynamic GCNs, temporal attention networks).\n4. Train models to predict longitudinal consistency and detect abrupt behavioral changes.\n5. Benchmark against static evaluation methods.\n6. Validate robustness on synthetic and real-world domain shift datasets.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sequential prompts related to medical diagnosis evolving with additional symptoms over time.\nExpected Output: Temporal graph embeddings reveal stable behavioral patterns with low drift scores indicating high longitudinal consistency.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If temporal GNNs underperform, explore recurrent neural networks on graph embeddings or contrastive learning for longitudinal consistency. Alternatively, apply smoothing or filtering techniques to mitigate noise in behavioral trajectories."
