    "title": "Probabilistic Embedding Uncertainty Propagation for Robust Semantic Interpretation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing embedding evaluation approaches do not adequately quantify or propagate uncertainty, leading to brittle semantic analysis especially under noisy or ambiguous language contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Responding to the internal gap in uncertainty quantification and inspired by multi-omics uncertainty integration from the biological cluster, this research introduces probabilistic embedding models that explicitly model and propagate uncertainty for reliable semantic interpretation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design Bayesian embedding models that produce distributional embeddings reflecting uncertainty at token and sentence levels. Develop uncertainty propagation techniques for downstream tasks, allowing robust semantic interpretation even under ambiguity or domain shift. Introduce metrics merging uncertainty with representational quality to guide model development and evaluation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Train LLM variants with Bayesian dropout and ensemble methods to capture uncertainty.\\n2. Develop uncertainty-aware semantic similarity measures and downstream classifiers.\\n3. Evaluate under noisy input conditions and out-of-domain datasets.\\n4. Benchmark against classical embedding confidence baselines.\\n5. Analyze impact of uncertainty integration on interpretability and downstream robustness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Ambiguous sentence pairs with homonyms and polysemy.\\nExpected Output: Embeddings with calibrated uncertainty distributions, improved disambiguation via uncertainty-weighted similarity scoring.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If full probabilistic modeling is computationally prohibitive, approximate uncertainty using ensemble variance or dropout uncertainty heuristics. Alternatively, integrate heuristic uncertainty filters into existing embedding pipelines."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines Bayesian embedding models producing distributional embeddings with uncertainty, and developing uncertainty propagation techniques for downstream tasks. However, it lacks concrete technical details on how uncertainty will be quantitatively modeled, propagated, and integrated with existing semantic similarity or classification frameworks. The mechanism for combining uncertainty with representational quality metrics is also vague. Clarifying the mathematical formulations, inference procedures, and specific algorithms used is critical for assessing soundness and ensuring reproducibility and clarity for this highly technical proposal. Consider providing more explicit details about model design and uncertainty propagation mechanisms within the embedding and downstream tasks pipelines to strengthen soundness and feasibility assessment too, especially under the complex semantic ambiguity and domain shift challenges addressed here. This will also help differentiate the approach from existing Bayesian or ensemble-based uncertainty methods in embedding spaces, which is essential given the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the competitive nature of uncertainty modeling in embeddings, linking this work with globally-linked concepts like 'ensemble learning' and 'network biology'—especially multi-omics uncertainty integration—could elevate impact and novelty. For example, integrating graph neural networks to exploit semantic and syntactic relationships in a probabilistic embedding space may enhance uncertainty modeling robustness. Additionally, exploring multi-omics-inspired uncertainty fusion techniques might enable novel multi-view embedding uncertainty propagation approaches. Such cross-disciplinary methodology fusion could significantly broaden the scope and applicability of the work across natural language tasks perceptive to domain shifts and noisy inputs. Explicitly articulating these integrations or designing experiments inspired by biological multi-omics uncertainty integration analogies may provide a strong distinctive edge and deeper theoretical grounding."
