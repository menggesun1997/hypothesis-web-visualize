    "title": "QSAR-Driven Intrinsic Evaluation for Language Model Toxicity Prediction",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs increasingly generate outputs with potentially toxic content, yet intrinsic evaluation methods lack robust behavioral and biological analogy metrics rooted in chemical hazard assessment, limiting the ability to predict and understand model toxicity across domains and longitudinally.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the external gap identified by leveraging QSAR modeling—commonly used in toxicology—to enhance intrinsic evaluation of LLMs by analogically modeling toxicity-related output behaviors. It proposes a novel cross-disciplinary synthesis to assess toxicity consistency and robustness in language output, inspired by chemical structure-activity relationships.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a QSAR-like computational pipeline where LLM-generated textual outputs are encoded with structural linguistic features (syntax tree patterns, semantic polarity markers, and lexical toxicity indicators). These features form 'chemical-like' descriptors that feed into predictive QSAR models adapted from chemistry to estimate inherent toxicity risks and behavioral consistency under perturbations or contextual shifts. This hybrid metric offers a systematic, predictive intrinsic evaluation of toxicity risks in LLM behavior.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate datasets of LLM outputs labeled for toxicity across multiple prompt types.\n2. Extract structural linguistic descriptors mimicking chemical features used in QSAR.\n3. Train QSAR-inspired predictive models using these descriptors to estimate toxicity scores.\n4. Evaluate model robustness over perturbations and contextual changes.\n5. Benchmark against standard toxicity evaluation measures.\n6. Test on multiple LLMs and toxicological datasets for generalizability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt \"Tell me about minority groups.\" with variations including neutral, sensitive, and adversarial forms.\nExpected Output: QSAR-based toxicity risk scores predict higher risk on adversarial inputs, consistent across perturbations, revealing model fragility or robustness in toxicity behavior.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If linguistic descriptors alone inadequately capture toxicity, integrate external knowledge graph embeddings of toxic concepts or use multimodal QSAR combining image and text toxicity features. Alternatively, incorporate reinforcement learning feedback loops to refine predictor models."

        "title": "QSAR-Inspired Multilevel Toxicity Evaluation for Language Models with Ecological Risk Assessment Paradigm",
        "Problem_Statement": "While large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate outputs containing toxic content, current intrinsic evaluation paradigms inadequately capture the complex, context-dependent, and dynamic nature of toxicity. Existing chemical QSAR-inspired analogies risk oversimplifying linguistic toxicity by relying predominantly on structural linguistic features without incorporating semantic depth or longitudinal behavioral dynamics. Moreover, current evaluations are often static snapshots, overlooking cumulative toxicity arising from sequential or multiple prompt interactions that better resemble ecological exposure scenarios, hindering comprehensive toxicity risk understanding and mitigation.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing these limitations, this proposal develops a novel multilevel toxicity evaluation framework that integrates QSAR-inspired structural linguistic descriptors with semantic and pragmatic embeddings, grounded in rigorous empirical validation of the linguistic-to-chemical descriptor analogy. Further, the approach innovatively adopts ecological risk assessment concepts from toxicology, modeling cumulative and synergistic toxicity risks across multiple user interactions and temporal sequences. This comprehensive, dynamic toxicity profiling enhances evaluation robustness and addresses prior novelty competitiveness by bridging toxicology principles with advanced NLP evaluation, promising a leap beyond existing static toxicity metrics in scope, interpretability, and predictive power.",
        "Proposed_Method": "1) Empirically validate the foundational analogy by comparing toxicity prediction performance of QSAR-style models built on structural linguistic features alone versus those augmented with semantic embeddings (e.g., contextual language model embeddings) and external toxicology knowledge graphs, quantifying the incremental value of hybrid descriptors.\n\n2) Develop a QSAR-inspired computational pipeline that encodes LLM outputs through multilevel descriptors: syntactic structures (syntax trees), lexical toxicity indicators, semantic/pragmatic embeddings, and toxicology-informed knowledge embeddings to capture nuanced toxicity signals.\n\n3) Incorporate ecological risk assessment paradigms by modeling cumulative toxicity exposure of LLMs over sequences of prompts and user interactions, analogous to chemical exposure to multiple compounds over time, leveraging statistical models that estimate synergistic risk and temporal toxicity progression.\n\n4) Implement predictive models that not only score single-output toxicity risk but also estimate dynamic, context-dependent toxicity trajectories across interactions.\n\n5) Evaluate robustness under perturbations and contextual shifts, benchmarking against conventional toxicity evaluation metrics, across diverse LLM architectures and toxicological datasets.\n\nThis hybrid, multilevel approach explicitly addresses the semantic and pragmatic complexities of language toxicity and advances evaluation from static snapshots to dynamic, ecology-inspired risk landscapes, significantly advancing novelty and impact.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate multi-turn conversation datasets and single-prompt outputs with fine-grained toxicity annotations capturing semantic and pragmatic nuances.\n2. Extract and validate structural linguistic descriptors, semantic embeddings (e.g., transformer-based contextual vectors), and encode external toxicology knowledge graph embeddings.\n3. Compare predictive performance of toxicity models built respectively on structural descriptors alone, semantic+structural hybrids, and semantic+structural+knowledge embeddings to rigorously justify the linguistic/chemical descriptor analogy.\n4. Develop models that aggregate per-output toxicity over sequences/interactions to simulate cumulative ecological exposure, estimating synergistic toxicity risks.\n5. Test model robustness to input perturbations and context shifts, measuring stability and sensitivity.\n6. Benchmark against existing toxicity evaluation metrics across multiple LLMs (e.g., GPT, PaLM) and diverse toxicological datasets.\n7. Analyze longitudinal toxicity risk profiles to reveal dynamic fragility or robustness patterns.\n8. Perform ablation studies to confirm contribution of each component (structural, semantic, ecological).",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multi-turn dialogue on sensitive topics, e.g., prompt sequence starting with \"Tell me about minority groups.\" followed by adversarial or context-shifting prompts.\nExpected Output: QSAR-inspired multilevel toxicity evaluation yields toxicity risk scores per utterance and aggregate ecological risk metrics showing increased cumulative toxicity under adversarial dialog flows, while remaining stable under neutral variations. Models augmented with semantic embeddings and ecological risk assessment outperform structural-only QSAR analogues, demonstrating nuanced and dynamic toxicity detection.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If QSAR-style structural descriptors plus semantic embeddings inadequately capture nuanced toxicity, shift focus toward fully embedding-based toxicity predictors integrating reinforcement learning from human feedback emphasizing pragmatic toxicity cues. Additionally, explore multimodal approaches incorporating visual toxic content proxies or user feedback loops to iteratively refine dynamic toxicity risk models."

Language toxicity is fundamentally semantic and pragmatic, whereas QSAR traditionally maps well-defined chemical structures to biological activity. The analogy risks oversimplifying complexities of linguistic toxicity, such as context dependence and nuanced semantics, which may not be fully captured by syntax trees or lexical toxicity indicators alone. Clarify and empirically validate this foundational analogy early, or consider hybridizing with semantic-level embeddings or external toxicology knowledge to support the assumption robustly in the Proposed_Method section."

Specifically, consider modeling the cumulative or synergistic toxicity risk in LLM outputs across multiple prompts or user interactions, analogous to exposure to multiple chemicals in ecological contexts. Leveraging this globally linked concept can provide a more comprehensive behavioral toxicity profile for language models over time and use cases. This could widen the scope beyond static toxicity scoring toward dynamic, longitudinal risk assessment, increasing both impact and distinctiveness."
