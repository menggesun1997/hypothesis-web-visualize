    "title": "Graph-Integrated Behavioral Consistency Networks for LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic evaluation methods for LLMs struggle with expressing behavioral consistency across diverse input perturbations due to lack of structured representation of input variations and model responses. This limits the ability to robustly assess model reliability and generalization in intrinsic evaluation.",
    "Motivation": "This project directly addresses the critical gap of bridging methodological approaches by introducing graph neural networks (GNNs) as a structural encoding tool that can systematize behavioral consistency checks. It leverages the hidden bridge opportunity by integrating GNNs from biomedical engineering to encode and compare varied behaviors of LLMs, making intrinsic evaluation more generalizable and interpretable.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel evaluation framework where LLM behavioral outputs under multiple perturbations are encoded as nodes in a graph, with edges representing semantic or syntactic similarity of input prompts. A graph neural network is trained to learn embeddings of behavioral consistency patterns, enabling quantitative assessment of model robustness and revealing latent inconsistency clusters. This graph-structured behavioral data representation is coupled with traditional intrinsic metrics, forming a hybrid evaluation framework.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect benchmark datasets of LLM inputs with designed perturbations (e.g., paraphrasing, adversarial noise).\n2. Obtain LLM outputs and construct behavioral graphs encoding relationships among input variants and their outputs.\n3. Train GNN models to embed these graphs and predict robustness scores.\n4. Evaluate against baselines using standard intrinsic metrics (e.g., perplexity, consistency rate).\n5. Analyze correlation and complementary insights between GNN embeddings and traditional measures.\n6. Test generalization on multiple LLM architectures and domains.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Original prompt \"What is the capital of France?\" and perturbed inputs \"France's capital?\", \"Which city is the capital of France?\", \"Capital city of France?\"\nExpected Output: Behavioral graph with nodes representing each prompt's LLM response embedding, edges representing semantic similarity of prompts; GNN predicts a high behavioral consistency score indicating robust performance across variations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If GNN embeddings do not correlate well with intrinsic evaluation metrics, fallback to simpler graph metrics (e.g., node centrality, clustering coefficients) to capture behavioral patterns. Alternatively, incorporate attention-based models that weigh influence of perturbations on output variance, or explore transformer-based graph neural architectures."
