    "title": "Dynamic Interaction Context Embedding for Vision-Language Multi-Modal Probing",
    "Problem_Statement": "Static, isolated language and vision modeling approaches limit the ability of LLMs to intrinsically benchmark understanding of interaction dynamics and temporal context.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap related to the exclusion of action and interaction dynamics from vision models and the external gap of untapped bridge connecting network language models and object recognition for interaction-aware benchmarking.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Propose a model architecture embedding temporal sequences of interaction events jointly with corresponding language utterances into a unified latent space capturing interaction context. Develop probing tasks that assess model comprehension of dynamic context, causal chains, and event roles intrinsic to naturalistic language understanding and vision perception.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Curate datasets of video sequences with detailed annotations of human-object interactions and aligned natural language describing the interactions temporally. (2) Train or fine-tune vision-language transformer models modified with temporal attention and cross-modal fusion layers. (3) Create probes that test whether the model can predict missing interaction steps, causality, and role assignments from incomplete input. (4) Measure intrinsic model representations' fidelity to interaction semantics and temporal coherence using metrics such as mutual information and probe accuracy. (5) Benchmark against models lacking temporal or multi-modal fusion capabilities.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A video clip showing a person picking up a cup but missing the drinking action, with a probe asking 'What likely happens next?' Expected output: The model correctly predicts the next interaction step 'drinking from the cup' and relates it semantically in language, showing intrinsic understanding of interaction dynamics.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If temporal fusion fails, incorporate explicit event segmentation modules or hierarchical modeling to better capture interaction stages. If probe difficulty is too high, simplify tasks initially focusing on static snapshots then gradually increasing temporal complexity."
