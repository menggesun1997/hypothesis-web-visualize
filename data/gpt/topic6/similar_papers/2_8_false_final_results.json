    "title": "Nonlinear Embedding Trajectory Analysis for Cross-Context Semantic Shift Modeling",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM embeddings rarely capture or represent smooth semantic shifts across differing contexts, limiting their adaptability and interpretability for nuanced language phenomena.",
    "Motivation": "This idea targets the lack of dynamic nonlinear modeling of embedding spaces (critical internal gap) and aligns with Opportunity 2 by applying nonlinear dynamical systems theory to analyze embedding trajectories across contexts, unveiling latent semantic smoothness and shifts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Model sentences or phrases as trajectories through embedding space over varying contexts or time using nonlinear dynamic system identification methods like HAVOK and Takens embedding. Extract latent dynamical modes representing semantic drift and abrupt shifts. Use these insights to create metrics and visualization approaches reflecting embedding fluidity and semantic stability across contexts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets with context-rich linguistic data (e.g., historical text corpora, dialogue datasets).\\n2. Generate embedding sequences per token/phrase under varying contextual embeddings.\\n3. Apply nonlinear dynamical system identification to reconstruct embedding attractors and modes.\\n4. Validate identification of semantic shifts with annotated datasets.\\n5. Test correlations with downstream model performance improvements.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Embedding trajectories of the word 'virus' across pandemic news articles over time.\\nExpected Output: Visualization and quantification of semantic drift reflecting changes in public discourse and meaning over time.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If nonlinear reconstruction is unstable, fallback to linear temporal embedding analyses or kernel-based trajectory clustering to capture semantic shifts."
