    "abstract": "In a perfect world, scientists would develop analyses that are guaranteed to reveal the ground truth of a research question. In reality, there are countless viable workflows that produce distinct, often conflicting, results. Although reproducibility places a necessary bound on the validity of results, it is not sufficient for claiming underlying validity, eventual utility, or generalizability. In this work we focus on how embracing variability in data analysis can improve the generalizability of results. We contextualize how design decisions in brain imaging can be made to capture variation, highlight examples, and discuss how variability capture may improve the quality of results.",

    "abstract": "New approaches in toxicology based on in vitro methods and computational modelling offer considerable potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of chemical hazard and risk assessment in a variety of regulatory contexts. However, this presents challenges both for developers and regulatory assessors because often these two communities do not share the same level of confidence in a new approach. To address this challenge, various assessment frameworks have been developed over the past 20 years with the aim of creating harmonised and systematic approaches for evaluating new methods. These frameworks typically focus on specific methodologies and technologies, which has proven useful for establishing the validity and credibility of individual methods. However, given the increasing need to compare methods and combine their use in integrated assessment strategies, the multiplicity of frameworks is arguably becoming a barrier to their acceptance. In this commentary, we explore the concepts of model validity and credibility, and we illustrate how a set of seven credibility factors provides a method-agnostic means of comparing different kinds of predictive toxicology approaches. It is hoped that this will facilitate communication and cross-disciplinarity among method developers and users, with the ultimate aim of increasing the acceptance and use of predictive approaches in toxicology.",

    "abstract": "Functional connectivity patterns in the human brain, like the friction ridges of a fingerprint, can uniquely identify individuals. Does this “brain fingerprint” remain distinct even during Alzheimer’s disease (AD)? Using fMRI data from healthy and pathologically ageing subjects, we find that individual functional connectivity profiles remain unique and highly heterogeneous during mild cognitive impairment and AD. However, the patterns that make individuals identifiable change with disease progression, revealing a reconfiguration of the brain fingerprint. Notably, connectivity shifts towards functional system connections in AD and lower-order cognitive functions in early disease stages. These findings emphasize the importance of focusing on individual variability rather than group differences in AD studies. Individual functional connectomes could be instrumental in creating personalized models of AD progression, predicting disease course, and optimizing treatments, paving the way for personalized medicine in AD management.",

    "abstract": "Accelerated brain aging (ABA) intricately links with age-associated neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, emphasizing the critical need for a nuanced exploration of heterogeneous ABA patterns. This investigation leveraged data from the UK Biobank (UKB) for a comprehensive analysis, utilizing structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) from 31,621 participants. Pre-processing employed tools from the FMRIB Software Library (FSL, version 5.0.10), FreeSurfer, DTIFIT, and MELODIC, seamlessly integrated into the UKB imaging processing pipeline. The Lasso algorithm was employed for brain-age prediction, utilizing derived phenotypes obtained from brain imaging data. Subpopulations of accelerated brain aging (ABA) and resilient brain aging (RBA) were delineated based on the error between actual age and predicted brain age. The ABA subgroup comprised 1949 subjects (experimental group), while the RBA subgroup comprised 3203 subjects (control group). Semi-supervised heterogeneity through discriminant analysis (HYDRA) refined and characterized the ABA subgroups based on distinctive neuroimaging features. HYDRA systematically stratified ABA subjects into three subtypes: SubGroup 2 exhibited extensive gray-matter atrophy, distinctive white-matter patterns, and unique connectivity features, displaying lower cognitive performance; SubGroup 3 demonstrated minimal atrophy, superior cognitive performance, and higher physical activity; and SubGroup 1 occupied an intermediate position. This investigation underscores pronounced structural and functional heterogeneity in ABA, revealing three subtypes and paving the way for personalized neuroprotective treatments for age-related neurological, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "A central question in neuroscience is how consciousness arises from the dynamic interplay of brain structure and function. Here we decompose functional MRI signals from pathological and pharmacologically-induced perturbations of consciousness into distributed patterns of structure-function dependence across scales: the harmonic modes of the human structural connectome. We show that structure-function coupling is a generalisable indicator of consciousness that is under bi-directional neuromodulatory control. We find increased structure-function coupling across scales during loss of consciousness, whether due to anaesthesia or brain injury, capable of discriminating between behaviourally indistinguishable sub-categories of brain-injured patients, tracking the presence of covert consciousness. The opposite harmonic signature characterises the altered state induced by LSD or ketamine, reflecting psychedelic-induced decoupling of brain function from structure and correlating with physiological and subjective scores. Overall, connectome harmonic decomposition reveals how neuromodulation and the network architecture of the human connectome jointly shape consciousness and distributed functional activation across scales.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms linking the brain’s network structure to cognitively relevant activation patterns remain largely unknown. Here, by leveraging principles of network control, we show how the architecture of the human connectome shapes transitions between 123 experimentally defined cognitive activation maps (cognitive topographies) from the NeuroSynth meta-analytic database. Specifically, we systematically integrated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data from functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tractography, cortical morphometry and positron emission tomography to simulate how anatomically guided transitions between cognitive states can be reshaped by neurotransmitter engagement or by changes in cortical thickness. Our model incorporates neurotransmitter-receptor density maps (18 receptors and transporters) and maps of cortical thickness pertaining to a wide range of mental health, neurodegenerative, psychiatric and neurodevelopmental diagnostic categories (17,000 patients and 22,000 controls). The results provide a comprehensive look-up table charting how brain network organization and chemoarchitecture interact to manifest different cognitive topographies, and establish a principled foundation for the systematic identification of ways to promote selective transitions between cognitive topographies.",

    "abstract": "High-level brain functions are widely believed to emerge from the orchestrated activity of multiple neural systems. However, lacking a formal definition and practical quantification of emergence for experimental data, neuroscientists have been unable to empirically test this long-standing conjecture. Here we investigate this fundamental question by leveraging a recently proposed framework known as \"Integrated Information Decomposition,\" which establishes a principled information-theoretic approach to operationalise and quantify emergence in dynamical systems - including the human brain. By analysing functional MRI data, our results show that the emergent and hierarchical character of neural dynamics is significantly diminished in chronically unresponsive patients suffering from severe brain injury. At a functional level, we demonstrate that emergence capacity is positively correlated with the extent of hierarchical organisation in brain activity. Furthermore, by combining computational approaches from network control theory and whole-brain biophysical modelling, we show that the reduced capacity for emergent and hierarchical dynamics in severely brain-injured patients can be mechanistically explained by disruptions in the patients' structural connectome. Overall, our results suggest that chronic unresponsiveness resulting from severe brain injury may be related to structural impairment of the fundamental neural infrastructures required for brain dynamics to support emergence.",

    "abstract": "The exponential scientific and technological progress during the past 30 years has favored the comprehensive characterization of aging processes with their multivariate nature, leading to the advent of Big Data in preclinical aging research. Spanning from molecular omics to organism-level deep phenotyping, Big Data demands large computational resources for storage and analysis, as well as new analytical tools and conceptual frameworks to gain novel insights leading to discovery. Systems biology has emerged as a paradigm that utilizes Big Data to gain insightful information enabling a better understanding of living organisms, visualized as multilayered networks of interacting molecules, cells, tissues and organs at different spatiotemporal scales. In this framework, where aging, health and disease represent emergent states from an evolving dynamic complex system, context given by, for example, strain, sex and feeding times, becomes paramount for defining the biological trajectory of an organism. Using bioinformatics and artificial intelligence, the systems biology approach is leading to remarkable advances in our understanding of the underlying mechanism of aging biology and assisting in creative experimental study designs in animal models. Future in-depth knowledge acquisition will depend on the ability to fully integrate information from different spatiotemporal scales in organisms, which will probably require the adoption of theories and methods from the field of complex systems. Here we review state-of-the-art approaches in preclinical research, with a focus on rodent models, that are leading to conceptual and/or technical advances in leveraging Big Data to understand basic aging biology and its full translational potential.",

    "year": 2023,

    "abstract": "Exposure to environmental organic pollutants has triggered significant ecological impacts and adverse health outcomes, which have been received substantial and increasing attention. The contribution of unidentified chemical components is considered as the most significant knowledge gap in understanding the combined effects of pollutant mixtures. To address this issue, remarkable analytical breakthroughs have recently been made. In this review, the basic principles on recognition of environmental organic pollutants are overviewed. Complementary analytical methodologies (i.e., quantitative structure-activity relationship prediction, mass spectrometric nontarget screening, and effect-directed analysis) and experimental platforms are briefly described. The stages of technique development and/or essential parts of the analytical workflow for each of the methodologies are then reviewed. Finally, plausible technique paths and applications of the future nontarget screening methods, interdisciplinary techniques for achieving toxicant identification, and burgeoning strategies on risk assessment of chemical cocktails are discussed.",

    "year": 2023,
    "citationCount": 3,
    "fieldCitationRatio": 2.06,
    "abstract": "Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) causes a sudden onset multi-system disease, permanently altering homeostasis with multiple complications. Consequences include aberrant neuronal circuits, multiple organ system dysfunctions, and chronic phenotypes such as neuropathic pain and metabolic syndrome. Reductionist approaches are used to classify SCI patients based on residual neurological function. Still, recovery varies due to interacting variables, including individual biology, comorbidities, complications, therapeutic side effects, and socioeconomic influences for which data integration methods are lacking. Infections, pressure sores, and heterotopic ossification are known recovery modifiers. However, the molecular pathobiology of the disease-modifying factors altering the neurological recovery-chronic syndrome trajectory is mainly unknown, with significant data gaps between intensive early treatment and chronic phases. Changes in organ function such as gut dysbiosis, adrenal dysregulation, fatty liver, muscle loss, and autonomic dysregulation disrupt homeostasis, generating progression-driving allostatic load. Interactions between interdependent systems produce emergent effects, such as resilience, that preclude single mechanism interpretations. Due to many interacting variables in individuals, substantiating the effects of treatments to improve neurological outcomes is difficult. Acute injury outcome predictors, including blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, neuroimaging signal changes, and autonomic system abnormalities, often do not predict chronic SCI syndrome phenotypes. In systems medicine, network analysis of bioinformatics data is used to derive molecular control modules. To better understand the evolution from acute SCI to chronic SCI multi-system states, we propose a topological phenotype framework integrating bioinformatics, physiological data, and allostatic load tested against accepted established recovery metrics. This form of correlational phenotyping may reveal critical nodal points for intervention to improve recovery trajectories. This study examines the limitations of current classifications of SCI and how these can evolve through systems medicine.",
