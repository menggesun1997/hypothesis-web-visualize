    "title": "QSAR-Driven Intrinsic Evaluation for Language Model Toxicity Prediction",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs increasingly generate outputs with potentially toxic content, yet intrinsic evaluation methods lack robust behavioral and biological analogy metrics rooted in chemical hazard assessment, limiting the ability to predict and understand model toxicity across domains and longitudinally.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the external gap identified by leveraging QSAR modeling—commonly used in toxicology—to enhance intrinsic evaluation of LLMs by analogically modeling toxicity-related output behaviors. It proposes a novel cross-disciplinary synthesis to assess toxicity consistency and robustness in language output, inspired by chemical structure-activity relationships.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a QSAR-like computational pipeline where LLM-generated textual outputs are encoded with structural linguistic features (syntax tree patterns, semantic polarity markers, and lexical toxicity indicators). These features form 'chemical-like' descriptors that feed into predictive QSAR models adapted from chemistry to estimate inherent toxicity risks and behavioral consistency under perturbations or contextual shifts. This hybrid metric offers a systematic, predictive intrinsic evaluation of toxicity risks in LLM behavior.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate datasets of LLM outputs labeled for toxicity across multiple prompt types.\n2. Extract structural linguistic descriptors mimicking chemical features used in QSAR.\n3. Train QSAR-inspired predictive models using these descriptors to estimate toxicity scores.\n4. Evaluate model robustness over perturbations and contextual changes.\n5. Benchmark against standard toxicity evaluation measures.\n6. Test on multiple LLMs and toxicological datasets for generalizability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt \"Tell me about minority groups.\" with variations including neutral, sensitive, and adversarial forms.\nExpected Output: QSAR-based toxicity risk scores predict higher risk on adversarial inputs, consistent across perturbations, revealing model fragility or robustness in toxicity behavior.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If linguistic descriptors alone inadequately capture toxicity, integrate external knowledge graph embeddings of toxic concepts or use multimodal QSAR combining image and text toxicity features. Alternatively, incorporate reinforcement learning feedback loops to refine predictor models."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that structural linguistic features can analogously function as chemical descriptors in QSAR models requires stronger justification. Language toxicity is fundamentally semantic and pragmatic, whereas QSAR traditionally maps well-defined chemical structures to biological activity. The analogy risks oversimplifying complexities of linguistic toxicity, such as context dependence and nuanced semantics, which may not be fully captured by syntax trees or lexical toxicity indicators alone. Clarify and empirically validate this foundational analogy early, or consider hybridizing with semantic-level embeddings or external toxicology knowledge to support the assumption robustly in the Proposed_Method section."

          "feedback_content": "To enhance both novelty and impact in this highly competitive area, integrate ecological risk assessment concepts from toxicology into the evaluation protocol. Specifically, consider modeling the cumulative or synergistic toxicity risk in LLM outputs across multiple prompts or user interactions, analogous to exposure to multiple chemicals in ecological contexts. Leveraging this globally linked concept can provide a more comprehensive behavioral toxicity profile for language models over time and use cases. This could widen the scope beyond static toxicity scoring toward dynamic, longitudinal risk assessment, increasing both impact and distinctiveness."
