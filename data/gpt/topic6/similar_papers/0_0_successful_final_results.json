    "title": "Interactive Vision-Language Grounding via Human-Object Interaction Probes",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing language and vision models are siloed, lacking integration that captures the semantics of human-object interactions within natural conversation contexts. This limits the ecological validity of benchmarks and hinders understanding of multi-modal cognition.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of siloed vision and language models and the external gap of unleveraged bridges between human-object interaction recognition and network language models, as highlighted in the critical gaps analysis. This idea proposes a novel intrinsic benchmark integrating these modalities.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-modal dataset combining video clips of human-object interactions paired with corresponding natural language descriptions and question probes designed to test understanding of the interactions. Then construct a vision-language model architecture that jointly encodes visual interaction features and language cues. Introduce intrinsic probes derived from semantic relationship analysis evaluating how well the model aligns visual interactive context with language understanding intrinsically rather than via downstream performance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Collect or curate datasets featuring diverse human-object interaction videos with dense semantic annotations and aligned descriptive language (e.g., cooking, assembly tasks). (2) Develop linguistic probe templates testing interaction understanding, causal relations, and temporal sequence comprehension. (3) Fine-tune vision-language pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP, Flamingo) on this data. (4) Evaluate models intrinsically using the probes measuring alignment beyond task metrics, e.g., probing embedding spaces, attention patterns. (5) Compare with traditional benchmarks and isolated vision-only or language-only models to quantify gains.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A video clip showing a person pouring water into a cup, with a description ‘The person is quenching their thirst.’ Probe question: 'Does the model understand the object being acted upon and the intended purpose?' Expected output: The model correctly associates the action 'pouring' with 'water' and the goal of 'quenching thirst', demonstrating comprehension beyond superficial correlations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If joint training proves unstable, attempt modular training with separate vision and language encoders combined via learned alignment layers. Alternatively, increase dataset diversity and annotation granularity to improve learning signals. Employ interpretability tools (attention analysis, causal attribution) to diagnose failure modes."

        "title": "Cognitively-Informed Vision-Language Grounding via Scalable Human-Object Interaction Probes",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current vision-language models often operate in siloed modalities and fail to deeply capture the semantics of human-object interactions within naturalistic and temporally rich contexts, limiting ecological and cognitive validity. Furthermore, existing benchmarks inadequately reflect integrated multi-modal cognition grounded in human cognitive theories, restricting progress in tasks requiring nuanced understanding of interactive behavior and causal relationships.",
        "Motivation": "While existing models advance vision-language integration, they frequently overlook fundamental insights from psychology of language and human cognition that could enrich model interpretability and grounding. This proposal addresses gaps by embedding cognitive frameworks, such as episodic memory and causal event understanding, into intrinsic multi-modal probing. Coupled with judicious dataset sourcing and scalable annotation strategies, this approach aims to yield a novel, reproducible, and competitive benchmark that not only advances model capabilities but also aligns with human cognitive processes, thus potentially unlocking impactful applications like human-aware robot navigation and dialogue systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose constructing a unified multi-modal benchmark combining curated existing datasets (e.g., EPIC-KITCHENS, Charades) enriched with scalable semantic annotations via semi-automatic methods and crowdsourcing, focusing on human-object interactions aligned with natural language descriptions and cognitively-inspired probes. Probes will be designed based on theories from subdisciplines of psychology—including episodic memory frameworks and causal inference models—to evaluate models' deep understanding beyond surface correlations. The vision-language architecture will jointly encode rich interactive visual embeddings with language cues, with an added EEG encoder module optionally incorporating neurocognitive signals where available, exploiting contrastive learning paradigms to align multi-modal representations. Training stability will be continuously monitored using concrete diagnostics such as embedding space clustering metrics and probe effectiveness milestones. The framework aims for zero-shot classification transferability and robust intrinsic evaluations, thus distinguishing itself from prior art by tightly integrating cognitive science insights with scalable, realistic data and neuro-inspired modalities.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Conduct a comprehensive survey to identify and select existing diverse video datasets featuring human-object interactions (e.g., EPIC-KITCHENS for cooking, HowTo100M for assembly tasks) that offer baseline annotations. (2) Develop scalable annotation pipelines combining semi-automatic annotation (using object/action detectors) with crowd-sourced vetting to generate dense semantic labels and aligned natural language probes inspired by cognitive theories. Employ active learning to prioritize uncertain samples, optimizing labor. (3) Design linguistic and visual probe templates grounded in episodic memory and causal inference theories to test temporal sequence comprehension, intentions, and interaction dynamics. (4) Integrate a multi-modal vision-language model architecture with contrastive learning, incorporating an optional EEG encoding branch trained on publicly available EEG datasets linked to object interaction tasks, enabling neurocognitive signal alignment. (5) Establish clear stability diagnostics including Frechet Inception Distance scores for representation quality, embedding space probe sensitivity analysis, and attention pattern interpretability metrics to detect and address instability early during joint training. (6) Perform rigorous intrinsic evaluations using the cognitive probes and benchmark against existing vision-only, language-only, and traditional vision-language baselines. (7) Validate zero-shot classification and robustness on held-out scenarios and explore applications to human-aware robotic navigation and dialogue system prototypes. This plan ensures practical feasibility, reproducibility, and meaningful progress within resource constraints.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A clip shows a person pouring water into a cup with the description ‘The person is quenching their thirst.’ A cognitively grounded probe: ‘Does the model recognize the causal relationship between the action of pouring water and the intention of thirst quenching?’ Expected Output: The model accurately associates the action ‘pouring’ with the object ‘water’ and the purpose ‘quenching thirst,’ exposing an embedding that reflects temporal and causal semantics consistent with human episodic cognition. Additionally, if EEG signals are used, aligned neural representations correspond meaningfully to the observed interaction. This demonstrates comprehension that transcends superficial correlations, enabling application to interactive systems.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If joint end-to-end training is unstable or yields limited gains, modular training strategies will be employed with separate vision, language, and EEG encoders combined via learned alignment layers fine-tuned with contrastive losses. Dataset augmentation through synthetic simulation environments (e.g., AI2-THOR) will supplement training data to increase diversity. Annotation scalability will be enhanced by incorporating active learning loops and leveraging weak supervision signals. Interpretability diagnostics such as attention rollout and causal attribution will guide iterative refinements. The model and probe framework will be tested incrementally to ensure progress and adjust scope based on feasibility, ensuring a robust research trajectory."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed multi-step experiment plan is generally sound but could underestimate the practical challenges related to dataset collection and annotation, as well as model joint training stability. Specifically, the reliance on dense semantic annotations combined with natural language probes across diverse human-object interactions may require significant labor and expert involvement, which is not sufficiently addressed. Additionally, the plan's fallback options mention modular training and increased dataset diversity but do not consider pre-existing datasets or simulation environments that could accelerate or bootstrap training. It would strengthen feasibility if the proposal detailed strategies for dataset sourcing (e.g., leveraging existing video datasets with annotations) and provided clearer criteria or diagnostics for training stability and probe effectiveness throughout model development. This will avoid costly iteration cycles and improve experimental tractability and result interpretability. Hence, refining the experiment plan to incorporate scalable annotation strategies and more concrete milestones for diagnosing and mitigating training or evaluation issues is recommended to ensure practical execution and reproducibility of results within typical project timelines and resource constraints. This suggestion targets 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan'."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment of 'NOV-COMPETITIVE' and the project's multi-modal vision-language grounding focus on human-object interaction, the proposal could significantly enhance impact and distinctiveness by integrating insights or methods from the psychology of language and human cognition domains. For example, grounding the semantic probes and interaction modeling in established theories of human cognitive processing or episodic memory could enrich the model's interpretability and ecological validity, aligning it with mechanisms known from subdisciplines of psychology. Additionally, linking the probing approach to behavioral evidence or neurocognitive signals (e.g., EEG) recorded during human object interaction tasks—though challenging—could provide a novel, biologically inspired signal for training or evaluation. Moreover, the concept of human-aware robot navigation or dialogue systems could be mentioned as high-impact applications exploiting such interactive grounding, thereby broadening potential applied relevance. Incorporating these globally linked concepts would strengthen novelty, improve interdisciplinary relevance, and potentially lead to state-of-the-art performance with a distinct research identity. This suggestion targets the overall idea framing and proposed method integration, beyond the existing sections."
