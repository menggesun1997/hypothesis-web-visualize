    "abstract": "With significant advancements of next generation sequencing technologies, large amounts of multi-omics data, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have been accumulated, offering an unprecedented opportunity to explore the heterogeneity and complexity of cancer across various molecular levels and scales. One of the promising aspects of multi-omics lies in its capacity to offer a holistic view of the biological networks and pathways underpinning cancer, facilitating a deeper understanding of its development, progression, and response to treatment. However, the exponential growth of data generated by multi-omics studies present significant analytical challenges. Processing, analyzing, integrating, and interpreting these multi-omics datasets to extract meaningful insights is an ambitious task that stands at the forefront of current cancer research. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful solution to these challenges, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in deciphering complex patterns and extracting valuable information from large-scale, intricate omics datasets. This review delves into the synergy of AI and multi-omics, highlighting its revolutionary impact on oncology. We dissect how this confluence is reshaping the landscape of cancer research and clinical practice, particularly in the realms of early detection, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and pathology. Additionally, we elaborate the latest AI methods for multi-omics integration to provide a comprehensive insight of the complex biological mechanisms and inherent heterogeneity of cancer. Finally, we discuss the current challenges of data harmonization, algorithm interpretability, and ethical considerations. Addressing these challenges necessitates a multidisciplinary collaboration, paving the promising way for more precise, personalized, and effective treatments for cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Constructing distributed representations for words through neural language models and using the resulting vector spaces for analysis has become a crucial component of natural language processing (NLP). However, despite their widespread application, little is known about the structure and properties of these spaces. To gain insights into the relationship between words, the NLP community has begun to adapt high-dimensional visualization techniques. In particular, researchers commonly use t-distributed stochastic neighbor embeddings (t-SNE) and principal component analysis (PCA) to create two-dimensional embeddings for assessing the overall structure and exploring linear relationships (e.g., word analogies), respectively. Unfortunately, these techniques often produce mediocre or even misleading results and cannot address domain-specific visualization challenges that are crucial for understanding semantic relationships in word embeddings. Here, we introduce new embedding techniques for visualizing semantic and syntactic analogies, and the corresponding tests to determine whether the resulting views capture salient structures. Additionally, we introduce two novel views for a comprehensive study of analogy relationships. Finally, we augment t-SNE embeddings to convey uncertainty information in order to allow a reliable interpretation. Combined, the different views address a number of domain-specific tasks difficult to solve with existing tools.",

    "abstract": "With progressive digitalization of healthcare systems worldwide, large-scale collection of electronic health records (EHRs) has become commonplace. However, an extensible framework for comprehensive exploratory analysis that accounts for data heterogeneity is missing. Here we introduce ehrapy, a modular open-source Python framework designed for exploratory analysis of heterogeneous epidemiology and EHR data. ehrapy incorporates a series of analytical steps, from data extraction and quality control to the generation of low-dimensional representations. Complemented by rich statistical modules, ehrapy facilitates associating patients with disease states, differential comparison between patient clusters, survival analysis, trajectory inference, causal inference and more. Leveraging ontologies, ehrapy further enables data sharing and training EHR deep learning models, paving the way for foundational models in biomedical research. We demonstrate ehrapy’s features in six distinct examples. We applied ehrapy to stratify patients affected by unspecified pneumonia into finer-grained phenotypes. Furthermore, we reveal biomarkers for significant differences in survival among these groups. Additionally, we quantify medication-class effects of pneumonia medications on length of stay. We further leveraged ehrapy to analyze cardiovascular risks across different data modalities. We reconstructed disease state trajectories in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on imaging data. Finally, we conducted a case study to demonstrate how ehrapy can detect and mitigate biases in EHR data. ehrapy, thus, provides a framework that we envision will standardize analysis pipelines on EHR data and serve as a cornerstone for the community.",

    "abstract": "Graph theory is now becoming a standard tool in system-level neuroscience. However, endowing observed brain anatomy and dynamics with a complex network structure does not entail that the brain actually works as a network. Asking whether the brain behaves as a network means asking whether network properties count. From the viewpoint of neurophysiology and, possibly, of brain physics, the most substantial issues a network structure may be instrumental in addressing relate to the influence of network properties on brain dynamics and to whether these properties ultimately explain some aspects of brain function. Here, we address the dynamical implications of complex network, examining which aspects and scales of brain activity may be understood to genuinely behave as a network. To do so, we first define the meaning of networkness, and analyse some of its implications. We then examine ways in which brain anatomy and dynamics can be endowed with a network structure and discuss possible ways in which network structure may be shown to represent a genuine organisational principle of brain activity, rather than just a convenient description of its anatomy and dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Molecular similarity pervades much of our understanding and rationalization of chemistry. This has become particularly evident in the current data-intensive era of chemical research, with similarity measures serving as the backbone of many Machine Learning (ML) supervised and unsupervised procedures. Here, we present a discussion on the role of molecular similarity in drug design, chemical space exploration, chemical \"art\" generation, molecular representations, and many more. We also discuss more recent topics in molecular similarity, like the ability to efficiently compare large molecular libraries.",

    "title": "Measuring relative opinion from location-based social media: A case study of the 2016 U.S. presidential election",
    "year": 2020,

    "abstract": "Social media has become an emerging alternative to opinion polls for public opinion collection, while it is still posing many challenges as a passive data source, such as structurelessness, quantifiability, and representativeness. Social media data with geotags provide new opportunities to unveil the geographic locations of users expressing their opinions. This paper aims to answer two questions: 1) whether quantifiable measurement of public opinion can be obtained from social media and 2) whether it can produce better or complementary measures compared to opinion polls. This research proposes a novel approach to measure the relative opinion of Twitter users towards public issues in order to accommodate more complex opinion structures and take advantage of the geography pertaining to the public issues. To ensure that this new measure is technically feasible, a modeling framework is developed including building a training dataset by adopting a state-of-the-art approach and devising a new deep learning method called Opinion-Oriented Word Embedding. With a case study of tweets on the 2016 U.S. presidential election, we demonstrate the predictive superiority of our relative opinion approach and we show how it can aid visual analytics and support opinion predictions. Although the relative opinion measure is proved to be more robust than polling, our study also suggests that the former can advantageously complement the latter in opinion prediction.",

    "abstract": "Memory reactivations and replay, widely reported in the hippocampus and cortex across species, have been implicated in memory consolidation, planning, and spatial and skill learning. Technological advances in electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and human neuroimaging techniques have enabled neuroscientists to measure large-scale neural activity with increasing spatiotemporal resolution and have provided opportunities for developing robust analytic methods to identify memory replay. In this article, we first review a large body of historically important and representative memory replay studies from the animal and human literature. We then discuss our current understanding of memory replay functions in learning, planning, and memory consolidation and further discuss the progress in computational modeling that has contributed to these improvements. Next, we review past and present analytic methods for replay analyses and discuss their limitations and challenges. Finally, looking ahead, we discuss some promising analytic methods for detecting nonstereotypical, behaviorally nondecodable structures from large-scale neural recordings. We argue that seamless integration of multisite recordings, real-time replay decoding, and closed-loop manipulation experiments will be essential for delineating the role of memory replay in a wide range of cognitive and motor functions.",

    "citationCount": 13,

    "abstract": "The correlation matrix is a typical representation of node interactions in functional brain network analysis. The analysis of the correlation matrix to characterize brain networks observed in several neuroimaging modalities has been conducted predominantly in the Euclidean space by assuming that pairwise interactions are mutually independent. One way to take account of all interactions in the network as a whole is to analyze the correlation matrix under some geometric structure. Recent studies have focused on the space of correlation matrices as a strict subset of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, which form a unique mathematical structure known as the Riemannian manifold. However, mathematical operations of the correlation matrix under the SPD geometry may not necessarily be coherent (i.e., the structure of the correlation matrix may not be preserved), necessitating a post-hoc normalization. The contribution of the current paper is twofold: (1) to devise a set of inferential methods on the correlation manifold and (2) to demonstrate its applicability in functional network analysis. We present several algorithms on the correlation manifold, including measures of central tendency, cluster analysis, hypothesis testing, and low-dimensional embedding. Simulation and real data analysis support the application of the proposed framework for brain network analysis.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), and, in particular, deep learning as a subcategory of AI, provides opportunities for the discovery and development of innovative drugs. Various machine learning approaches have recently (re)emerged, some of which may be considered instances of domain-specific AI which have been successfully employed for drug discovery and design. This review provides a comprehensive portrayal of these machine learning techniques and of their applications in medicinal chemistry. After introducing the basic principles, alongside some application notes, of the various machine learning algorithms, the current state-of-the art of AI-assisted pharmaceutical discovery is discussed, including applications in structure- and ligand-based virtual screening, de novo drug design, physicochemical and pharmacokinetic property prediction, drug repurposing, and related aspects. Finally, several challenges and limitations of the current methods are summarized, with a view to potential future directions for AI-assisted drug discovery and design.",

    "title": "Extracting Nonlinear Dynamics from Psychological and Behavioral Time Series Through HAVOK Analysis",

    "abstract": "Analytical methods derived from nonlinear dynamical systems, complexity, and chaos theories offer researchers a framework for in-depth analysis of time series data. However, relatively few studies involving time series data obtained from psychological and behavioral research employ such methods. This paucity of application is due to a lack of general analysis frameworks for modeling time series data with strong nonlinear components. In this article, we describe the potential of <i>Hankel alternative view of Koopman</i> (HAVOK) analysis for solving this issue. HAVOK analysis is a unified framework for nonlinear dynamical systems analysis of time series data. By utilizing HAVOK analysis, researchers may model nonlinear time series data in a linear framework while simultaneously reconstructing attractor manifolds and obtaining a secondary time series representing the amount of nonlinear forcing occurring in a system at any given time. We begin by showing the mathematical underpinnings of HAVOK analysis and then show example applications of HAVOK analysis for modeling time series data derived from real psychological and behavioral studies.",
