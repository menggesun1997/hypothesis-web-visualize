    "title": "Bio-Semantic LLM Evaluation via Immunological Benchmarking",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic evaluation metrics of LLMs lack grounding in complex, real-world semantic consistency scenarios. Traditional benchmarks often miss nuanced contextual understanding that biological systems embody, limiting robustness assessment and semantic alignment verification.",
    "Motivation": "This research addresses the critical gap of insular intrinsic evaluation methods that fail to exploit domain-specific grounded data by leveraging immunological studies as a novel biological analogy and benchmark. It expands Opportunity 1 by integrating richly validated semantic consistency checks using tumor immune microenvironment data, linking LLM behavior evaluation with immunological datasets and metrics.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a bio-semantic intrinsic evaluation framework that maps LLM output semantics to immunologically-derived semantic networks representing tumor immune microenvironment interactions. Using LUNA's abstract model combined with these networks, design new consistency and perplexity metrics that quantify LLM semantic coherence against the biological reference frame. Incorporate knowledge graphs constructed from gene-activation datasets, lymphocyte activation pathways, and immune signaling cascades to assess LLM-generated text coherence and anomaly rates.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Construct semantic graphs from tumor immune microenvironment datasets using publicly available immunology resources (e.g., TCGA, ImmPort). 2. Generate LLM outputs conditioned on immunologically relevant prompts requiring precise semantic reasoning. 3. Apply the new bio-semantic evaluation metrics alongside traditional perplexity and self-consistency assessments. 4. Compare evaluation results against standard benchmarks (e.g., GLUE) and biological semantic baselines. 5. Analyze correlation between biological semantic consistency and LLM trustworthiness indicators.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input Prompt: 'Describe the role of lymphocyte activation gene-3 in modulating the tumor microenvironment.' Expected Output: A text that correctly articulates interactions within the immune microenvironment, matching biological pathway semantics. The evaluation metric assigns high semantic consistency scores when LLM output maps correctly to the biological network, indicating robust semantic understanding.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If biological semantic networks prove too complex or noisy, fallback to simplified immunological pathway models or use synthetic immunology-inspired semantic graphs with curated annotations. Alternatively, integrate domain adaptation training for LLMs to better fit immunological data before evaluation."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section requires clearer articulation of how exactly LLM output semantics will be consistently and quantitatively mapped to immunologically-derived semantic networks. The mechanism for aligning free-form text to structured biological graphs, especially when biological data can be noisy and conceptual granularity mismatch exists, is currently underdefined. Elaborate on specific algorithms, mapping procedures, or similarity measures that will operationalize this semantic alignment to ensure replicability and methodological rigor, instead of a high-level concept that risks being underspecified or infeasible in practice. This will strengthen the soundness and credibility of the approach substantially.\n\nAdditionally, clarify the rationale behind using LUNA's abstract model within this context, detailing its advantages and integration steps with biological semantic networks. This will improve clarity and mechanistic understanding of the evaluation framework proposed for LLM testing in biomedical semantics contexts, aiding reproducibility and acceptance by both NLP and biomedical researchers alike. Without these clarifications, the idea risks being perceived as speculative, limiting its impact and soundness assessment."

          "feedback_content": "Considering the novelty is rated NOV-COMPETITIVE and noting the domain overlap, the project could significantly benefit from explicitly integrating global biomedical research infrastructures or consortia, such as the 'International Union of Nutritional Sciences'. Exploring cross-domain semantic alignment by incorporating diverse biological datasets beyond immunology—like nutritional studies or metabolic pathway data—could broaden the framework's applicability and impact. \n\nEngaging with institutions like the University Clinics of Kinshasa for access to diverse tumor microenvironment data or collaborations can also increase the dataset heterogeneity and evaluation robustness. This kind of global partnership or dataset integration would enhance both the novelty and real-world impact of the work by diversifying and scaling the biomedical semantic evaluation beyond a narrowly immunological scope. It also provides a concrete path towards cross-disciplinary and international collaboration, strengthening the research’s relevance and adoption potential."
