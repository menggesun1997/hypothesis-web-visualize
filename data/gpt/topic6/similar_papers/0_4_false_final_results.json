    "title": "Semantic Relationship Graph Probes as Intrinsic Metrics for Vision-Language Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic probe benchmarks inadequately leverage semantic relationship analysis linking language understanding with visual scene comprehension in interactive contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap revealed in the landscape map about hidden bridges between human-object interaction recognition, semantic relationships, and language modeling, thus innovating intrinsic benchmarking approaches.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct semantic relationship graphs from multi-modal inputs combining object recognition and language parses. Develop intrinsic probe sets that query model internal representations on these semantic graphs, testing relational reasoning, hierarchical understanding, and contextual groundingâ€”key components of human language and vision cognition.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Generate semantic relational graphs from existing multi-modal datasets with annotated object interactions and language descriptions. (2) Design probe tasks that require models to infer graph properties, predict missing edges, and explain semantic roles. (3) Embed these graphs within model training or as test probes to assess intrinsic comprehension of semantic relations. (4) Evaluate vision-language models on their ability to encode and leverage semantic relationships compared to baselines ignoring graph structure. (5) Use graph similarity metrics and probe accuracy as intrinsic benchmarks correlated with downstream language and vision task performance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A scene showing a person holding a book on a chair with corresponding sentences emphasizing ownership and spatial relations. Probe: 'Is the book on the chair or held by the person?' Expected output: The model correctly identifies relational roles consistent with human perception, demonstrating semantic graph understanding.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If graph-based probes prove computationally intensive or inconclusive, simplify by focusing on subgraph queries or use approximate graph embeddings. Employ attention visualization methods to validate model focus on relational structures."
