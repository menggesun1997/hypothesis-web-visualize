        "title": "Interactive Vision-Language Grounding via Human-Object Interaction Probes",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing language and vision models are siloed, lacking integration that captures the semantics of human-object interactions within natural conversation contexts. This limits the ecological validity of benchmarks and hinders understanding of multi-modal cognition.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of siloed vision and language models and the external gap of unleveraged bridges between human-object interaction recognition and network language models, as highlighted in the critical gaps analysis. This idea proposes a novel intrinsic benchmark integrating these modalities.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-modal dataset combining video clips of human-object interactions paired with corresponding natural language descriptions and question probes designed to test understanding of the interactions. Then construct a vision-language model architecture that jointly encodes visual interaction features and language cues. Introduce intrinsic probes derived from semantic relationship analysis evaluating how well the model aligns visual interactive context with language understanding intrinsically rather than via downstream performance.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Collect or curate datasets featuring diverse human-object interaction videos with dense semantic annotations and aligned descriptive language (e.g., cooking, assembly tasks). (2) Develop linguistic probe templates testing interaction understanding, causal relations, and temporal sequence comprehension. (3) Fine-tune vision-language pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP, Flamingo) on this data. (4) Evaluate models intrinsically using the probes measuring alignment beyond task metrics, e.g., probing embedding spaces, attention patterns. (5) Compare with traditional benchmarks and isolated vision-only or language-only models to quantify gains.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A video clip showing a person pouring water into a cup, with a description ‘The person is quenching their thirst.’ Probe question: 'Does the model understand the object being acted upon and the intended purpose?' Expected output: The model correctly associates the action 'pouring' with 'water' and the goal of 'quenching thirst', demonstrating comprehension beyond superficial correlations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If joint training proves unstable, attempt modular training with separate vision and language encoders combined via learned alignment layers. Alternatively, increase dataset diversity and annotation granularity to improve learning signals. Employ interpretability tools (attention analysis, causal attribution) to diagnose failure modes."

        "title": "Developmental Intrinsic Benchmarks Simulating Infant Language and Vision Acquisition",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM benchmarking lacks incorporation of biological maturation and interaction-driven learning principles, preventing models from being faithful cognitive developmental analogs.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap of oversimplification in modeling human language cognition and the external gap of neglecting infant learning and action-perception cycles, as per the second high-potential innovation opportunity.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a staged intrinsic benchmark that mimics infant developmental milestones by providing models with progressively complex, interactive multimodal input streams combining vision, sound, and language in ecologically valid sequences. Design probes reflecting cognitive milestones such as object permanence, joint attention, and language grounding over time. Evaluate models not only on static text tasks but on their ability to learn incrementally from interactive inputs resembling human maturation trajectories.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Assemble or simulate developmental datasets capturing infant interactions, including caregiver speech, object manipulation videos, and environmental sounds. (2) Define milestone-based probe sets mimicking infant cognitive tasks annotated for model evaluation. (3) Adapt existing vision-language transformers to incremental learning paradigms incorporating multimodal input sequences. (4) Train models progressively on data stages, evaluating intrinsic understanding with probes after each stage. (5) Benchmark against static-text-only models and analyze developmental similarity metrics comparing model progression to human infant data.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input stage 1: A video of caregiver pointing at a toy with simple speech labels, moving to stage 3 where the model receives multi-turn interactive input with requests and responses about objects. Expected output: The model correctly associates pointing gestures with object labels early, and at later stages answers language probes about object attributes and functions, simulating infant learning progression.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If incremental training is not feasible, utilize curriculum learning strategies or simulated replay buffers to approximate developmental stages. If multimodal data is insufficient, create synthetic datasets generated from procedural simulations of infant-adult interaction scenarios."

        "title": "Fusion of Psychophysical Data with Language-Vision Models for Intrinsic Cognitive Benchmarking",
        "Problem_Statement": "Present LLM intrinsic benchmarks do not incorporate rich psychophysical and biological psychology insights, failing to ground models as scientific analogs of human cognition.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap of underutilized biomedical and psychological science insights identified in the analysis, offering a pathway to scientifically grounded benchmarking beyond engineering metrics.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Integrate psychophysical experimental results (e.g., reaction times, error rates in language and vision tasks) and biological developmental data directly into the training and intrinsic probe evaluation of vision-language models. Propose new intrinsic metrics derived from human psychophysical patterns to measure model cognitive plausibility. Create multi-modal probes reflecting interaction-action perception cycles measured in humans to test model alignment with biological cognition patterns.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Collect relevant psychophysical datasets including human behavioral responses to language-vision tasks with temporal and interaction annotations. (2) Design intrinsic linguistic and perceptual probes informed by psychophysical task designs. (3) Integrate these metrics into model training objectives as auxiliary losses or probe-based fine-tuning. (4) Evaluate model predictions against human psychophysical data distributions, reaction patterns, and error types. (5) Analyze whether psychophysically enhanced models generalize better to unseen multi-modal tasks and align closer to human cognition.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A stimulus combining ambiguous visual cues with sentences requiring disambiguation, along with human reaction times and error rates. Expected output: The model's confidence scores and error patterns show similar distribution and latency correlates to human psychophysical responses, indicating cognitive plausibility.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct integration of psychophysical losses reduces performance, attempt post hoc benchmarking using model outputs mapped onto psychophysical scales. Alternatively, develop synthetic psychophysical-inspired probes modeling human-like uncertainty and reaction time distributions for model evaluation."

        "title": "Dynamic Interaction Context Embedding for Vision-Language Multi-Modal Probing",
        "Problem_Statement": "Static, isolated language and vision modeling approaches limit the ability of LLMs to intrinsically benchmark understanding of interaction dynamics and temporal context.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap related to the exclusion of action and interaction dynamics from vision models and the external gap of untapped bridge connecting network language models and object recognition for interaction-aware benchmarking.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Propose a model architecture embedding temporal sequences of interaction events jointly with corresponding language utterances into a unified latent space capturing interaction context. Develop probing tasks that assess model comprehension of dynamic context, causal chains, and event roles intrinsic to naturalistic language understanding and vision perception.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Curate datasets of video sequences with detailed annotations of human-object interactions and aligned natural language describing the interactions temporally. (2) Train or fine-tune vision-language transformer models modified with temporal attention and cross-modal fusion layers. (3) Create probes that test whether the model can predict missing interaction steps, causality, and role assignments from incomplete input. (4) Measure intrinsic model representations' fidelity to interaction semantics and temporal coherence using metrics such as mutual information and probe accuracy. (5) Benchmark against models lacking temporal or multi-modal fusion capabilities.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A video clip showing a person picking up a cup but missing the drinking action, with a probe asking 'What likely happens next?' Expected output: The model correctly predicts the next interaction step 'drinking from the cup' and relates it semantically in language, showing intrinsic understanding of interaction dynamics.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If temporal fusion fails, incorporate explicit event segmentation modules or hierarchical modeling to better capture interaction stages. If probe difficulty is too high, simplify tasks initially focusing on static snapshots then gradually increasing temporal complexity."

        "title": "Semantic Relationship Graph Probes as Intrinsic Metrics for Vision-Language Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic probe benchmarks inadequately leverage semantic relationship analysis linking language understanding with visual scene comprehension in interactive contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap revealed in the landscape map about hidden bridges between human-object interaction recognition, semantic relationships, and language modeling, thus innovating intrinsic benchmarking approaches.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct semantic relationship graphs from multi-modal inputs combining object recognition and language parses. Develop intrinsic probe sets that query model internal representations on these semantic graphs, testing relational reasoning, hierarchical understanding, and contextual grounding—key components of human language and vision cognition.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Generate semantic relational graphs from existing multi-modal datasets with annotated object interactions and language descriptions. (2) Design probe tasks that require models to infer graph properties, predict missing edges, and explain semantic roles. (3) Embed these graphs within model training or as test probes to assess intrinsic comprehension of semantic relations. (4) Evaluate vision-language models on their ability to encode and leverage semantic relationships compared to baselines ignoring graph structure. (5) Use graph similarity metrics and probe accuracy as intrinsic benchmarks correlated with downstream language and vision task performance.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A scene showing a person holding a book on a chair with corresponding sentences emphasizing ownership and spatial relations. Probe: 'Is the book on the chair or held by the person?' Expected output: The model correctly identifies relational roles consistent with human perception, demonstrating semantic graph understanding.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If graph-based probes prove computationally intensive or inconclusive, simplify by focusing on subgraph queries or use approximate graph embeddings. Employ attention visualization methods to validate model focus on relational structures."
