    "title": "Deep Immunology-Inspired Anomaly Detection for LLM Hallucination Control",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current hallucination detection in LLMs relies heavily on semantic metrics and heuristic signals, lacking robust, biologically inspired anomaly detection methods that can improve sensitivity and interpretability.",
    "Motivation": "Targets Opportunity 3 by appropriating deep neural network architectures and anomaly detection mechanisms pioneered in immunological data analysis to enhance LLM hallucination and robustness evaluation. This cross-domain transfer addresses the critical gap of isolated semantic-level evaluation, introducing a biomedical anomaly detection analog to intrinsic LLM evaluation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an LLM hallucination detection system that uses deep autoencoders and variational neural architectures adapted from immunological anomaly detectors (e.g., for lymphocyte activation abnormalities). Train these models on trusted LLM output distributions, using latent space representations sensitive to semantic and syntactic deviations. The system flags hallucinations as anomalies in latent space, incorporating biological-inspired thresholds and uncertainty quantification mechanisms.",

Train deep anomaly detection models originally designed for immune cell activation data on this corpus to learn normal output embeddings. 3. Evaluate model performance detecting artificially inserted hallucinations and out-of-distribution outputs. 4. Compare to baseline hallucination detection methods based on perplexity, self-consistency, and semantic similarity. 5. Analyze explainability of anomaly flags with immunology-inspired interpretability tools (e.g., activation maps).",

        "title": "Deep Immunology-Inspired Anomaly Detection for LLM Hallucination Control with Clinical Data Integration and Computational Intelligence Enhancements",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current hallucination detection in large language models (LLMs) predominantly relies on heuristic semantic metrics and ad hoc uncertainty estimates, lacking robust, interpretable anomaly detection frameworks inspired by biological systems. This limits sensitivity to subtle hallucinations and hinders trust in LLM deployments, especially in critical domains such as healthcare.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing Opportunity 3 by pioneering a biologically inspired cross-domain anomaly detection framework that leverages deep neural architectures originally developed for immunological data analysis to enhance LLM hallucination identification. This approach transcends traditional semantic heuristics through structured latent space anomaly detection, enriched by integrating clinically validated datasets from collaborating medical institutions such as the University Clinics of Kinshasa. Furthermore, embedding computational intelligence methods—including advanced uncertainty quantification and communication network theories—augments model robustness and interpretability. Positioning this work within computational intelligence venues like ECML-PKDD will foster cross-disciplinary engagement and improve its novelty and impact beyond existing semantic-level approaches.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose to concretely adapt immunology-inspired anomaly detection architectures—originally designed to identify lymphocyte activation abnormalities in cellular-level data—to the domain of LLM output representation as follows: \n\n1. **Architectural Adaptation:** Starting from deep variational autoencoders (VAEs) used in immunology to encode high-dimensional immune cell marker expressions, we map LLM-generated outputs into analogous latent spaces. Specifically, LLM outputs are transformed using semantic and syntactic embeddings (e.g., contextualized token-level embeddings combined with syntactic parse features) to form input vectors analogous to immunological cellular activation profiles.\n\n2. **Latent Space Representation:** The VAE encodes these embeddings into a latent space designed to capture distributional norms analogous to 'normal' immune cell activation states. Hallucinations manifest as deviations in latent activations, akin to abnormal lymphocyte patterns.\n\n3. **Biological-Inspired Thresholding:** We operationalize biological thresholding heuristics—such as activation potential cutoffs and clonal expansion analogs—as statistical distance metrics (e.g., Mahalanobis distance) in latent space, calibrated through immunology-inspired uncertainty quantification to set anomaly detection boundaries robust to natural output variability.\n\n4. **Interpretability via Activation Maps:** Inspired by immunological interpretability tools (e.g., marker expression heatmaps), we develop attention and gradient-based activation maps that highlight tokens and phrases contributing to anomaly scores, enabling explainable hallucination localization within outputs.\n\n5. **Computational Intelligence Integration:** Leveraging uncertainty quantification methods from computational intelligence (e.g., Bayesian dropout, ensemble variance) enhances anomaly confidence scoring, while communication network theory principles inform the modeling of token-level interaction patterns as signaling pathways, thus improving detection of complex hallucination structures.\n\n6. **Clinical Data Integration:** Collaborations with the University Clinics of Kinshasa facilitate curating a corpus of clinically verified LLM outputs and human expert annotations, reinforcing training realism and evaluation credibility.\n\nThis method establishes a detailed mechanistic analogy and architectural mapping between immunological anomaly detection and LLM hallucination identification, fostering reproducibility and deeper validation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. **Data Collection:** Collaborate with University Clinics of Kinshasa to build a curated dataset comprising clinically validated LLM-generated responses, expert human-written texts, and annotated hallucinations.\n2. **Input Representation Design:** Develop and validate semantic-syntactic embedding schemes serving as inputs analogous to immune cell activation profiles.\n3. **Model Development:** Adapt and re-implement immunology-origin VAEs with added computational intelligence modules (uncertainty quantification, communication network informed layers).\n4. **Training:** Train anomaly detection models on the curated trustworthy corpus to learn normative latent distributions.\n5. **Evaluation:** Assess anomaly detection performance on benchmark hallucination test sets, including artificially inserted hallucinations and out-of-distribution prompts.\n6. **Baselines and Comparisons:** Benchmark against perplexity, self-consistency methods, and semantic similarity detectors.\n7. **Interpretability Analysis:** Generate and evaluate activation maps to validate interpretability aligning with clinical hallucination indicators.\n8. **Robustness Checks:** Test thresholds and uncertainty measures under varying clinical domain shifts and noisy inputs.\n9. **Dissemination:** Prepare submission and presentations targeting computational intelligence conferences such as ECML-PKDD to enhance cross-disciplinary visibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An LLM-generated medical answer to a diagnostic query that contains fabricated symptoms or treatment information unsupported by clinical guidelines.\nExpected Output: The adapted immunology-inspired anomaly detection system returns a significantly elevated anomaly score, surpassing perplexity-based baselines, and provides interpretable activation maps pinpointing specific hallucinated tokens and phrases. This highlights misalignments in semantic and syntactic embeddings corresponding to deviations from learned clinical norms.\n\nAdditionally, uncertainty quantification outputs accompany the anomaly flag, offering a calibrated confidence estimate facilitating decision support in clinical deployment.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the immunology-inspired anomaly detectors demonstrate limited performance or lack scalability, fallback strategies include: \n\n- Incorporating hybrid architectures that combine domain-specific anomaly detection components with transformer-based uncertainty estimators leveraging ensemble methods.\n- Using synthetic immunological anomaly datasets to pretrain or augment model robustness, adapting domain adaptation techniques to bridge immunological and linguistic data gaps.\n- Expanding collaborations with clinical partners to increase real-world data diversity, improving model generalization.\n- Exploring alternative biologically inspired frameworks (e.g., neural immune system models of pathogen detection) for richer analogy mappings."

The analogy between lymphocyte activation abnormalities and LLM hallucination signatures requires clearer mechanistic justification and more detailed architectural mapping. For instance, it's unclear how semantic and syntactic deviations map onto immunological activation latent spaces, or how biological-inspired thresholds translate mathematically or algorithmically within language model embeddings. This gap in explanation could hinder reproducibility and validation.
