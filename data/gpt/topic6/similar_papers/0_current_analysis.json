  "prompt": "You are a world-class research strategist and data synthesizer. Your mission is to analyze a curated set of research papers and their underlying conceptual structure to produce a comprehensive 'Landscape Map' that reveals the current state, critical gaps, and novel opportunities in the field of **Intrinsic Benchmarking of LLMs via Language Understanding Probes**.\n\n### Part A: Foundational Literature\nHere are the core similar research papers, which includes the paperId, title and abstract.\n```text\n[{'paper_id': 1, 'title': 'Beyond the limitations of any imaginable mechanism: Large language models and psycholinguistics', 'abstract': 'Large language models (LLMs) are not detailed models of human linguistic processing. They are, however, extremely successful at their primary task: Providing a model for language. For this reason LLMs are important in psycholinguistics: They are useful as a practical tool, as an illustrative comparative, and philosophically, as a basis for recasting the relationship between language and thought.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': \"Let's move forward: Image-computable models and a common model evaluation scheme are prerequisites for a scientific understanding of human vision\", 'abstract': 'In the target article, Bowers et al. dispute deep artificial neural network (ANN) models as the currently leading models of human vision without producing alternatives. They eschew the use of public benchmarking platforms to compare vision models with the brain and behavior, and they advocate for a fragmented, phenomenon-specific modeling approach. These are unconstructive to scientific progress. We outline how the Brain-Score community is moving forward to add new model-to-human comparisons to its community-transparent suite of benchmarks.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Models of vision need some action', 'abstract': 'Bowers et al. focus their criticisms on research that compares behavioral and brain data from the ventral stream with a class of deep neural networks for object recognition. While they are right to identify issues with current benchmarking research programs, they overlook a much more fundamental limitation of this literature: Disregarding the importance of action and interaction for perception.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Even deeper problems with neural network models of language', 'abstract': \"We recognize today's deep neural network (DNN) models of language behaviors as engineering achievements. However, what we know intuitively and scientifically about language shows that what DNNs are and how they are trained on bare texts, makes them poor models of mind and brain for language organization, as it interacts with infant biology, maturation, experience, unique principles, and natural law.\"}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Deep neural networks are not a single hypothesis but a language for expressing computational hypotheses', 'abstract': 'An ideal vision model accounts for behavior and neurophysiology in both naturalistic conditions and designed lab experiments. Unlike psychological theories, artificial neural networks (ANNs) actually perform visual tasks and generate testable predictions for arbitrary inputs. These advantages enable ANNs to engage the entire spectrum of the evidence. Failures of particular models drive progress in a vibrant ANN research program of human vision.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Neural networks, AI, and the goals of modeling', 'abstract': 'Deep neural networks (DNNs) have found many useful applications in recent years. Of particular interest have been those instances where their successes imitate human cognition and many consider artificial intelligences to offer a lens for understanding human intelligence. Here, we criticize the underlying conflation between the predictive and explanatory power of DNNs by examining the goals of modeling.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Psychophysics may be the game-changer for deep neural networks (DNNs) to imitate the human vision', 'abstract': 'Psychologically faithful deep neural networks (DNNs) could be constructed by training with psychophysics data. Moreover, conventional DNNs are mostly monocular vision based, whereas the human brain relies mainly on binocular vision. DNNs developed as smaller vision agent networks associated with fundamental and less intelligent visual activities, can be combined to simulate more intelligent visual activities done by the biological brain.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Clarifying status of DNNs as models of human vision', 'abstract': 'On several key issues we agree with the commentators. Perhaps most importantly, everyone seems to agree that psychology has an important role to play in building better models of human vision, and (most) everyone agrees (including us) that deep neural networks (DNNs) will play an important role in modelling human vision going forward. But there are also disagreements about what models are for, how DNN-human correspondences should be evaluated, the value of alternative modelling approaches, and impact of marketing hype in the literature. In our view, these latter issues are contributing to many unjustified claims regarding DNN-human correspondences in vision and other domains of cognition. We explore all these issues in this response.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Why psychologists should embrace rather than abandon DNNs', 'abstract': 'Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful computational models, which generate complex, high-level representations that were missing in previous models of human cognition. By studying these high-level representations, psychologists can now gain new insights into the nature and origin of human high-level vision, which was not possible with traditional handcrafted models. Abandoning DNNs would be a huge oversight for psychological sciences.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Neither hype nor gloom do DNNs justice', 'abstract': \"Neither the hype exemplified in some exaggerated claims about deep neural networks (DNNs), nor the gloom expressed by Bowers et al. do DNNs as models in vision science justice: DNNs rapidly evolve, and today's limitations are often tomorrow's successes. In addition, providing explanations as well as prediction and image-computability are model desiderata; one should not be favoured at the expense of the other.\"}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "current_research_landscape": "The core research area centers on modeling human language and vision cognition through artificial neural networks, especially deep neural networks (DNNs), to better understand underlying mechanisms of language behavior and vision. The central problem involves creating computational models that not only perform well on language and vision tasks but also serve as faithful scientific models of human cognition and brain function. The thematic islands reveal distinct but related paradigms: (1) modeling human vision using image-computable deep neural networks, (2) modeling language behavior through network models of language including today's deep networks, and (3) sub-domains like object recognition and ventral stream visual processing. Dominant methods focus heavily on deep artificial neural networks trained on large datasets for tasks like object recognition and language modeling. These models are evaluated primarily on predictive performance, often using benchmarking platforms, to compare model outputs with human behavioral or neural data. There is consensus on the importance of psychology and behavioral data in shaping and evaluating these models, endorsing DNNs as powerful computational tools despite limitations.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Key papers highlight that current DNNs, while engineering successes, are poor models of human linguistic cognition due to oversimplification—e.g., lacking integration of biology, maturation, interaction, and natural language acquisition principles. There is a methodological gap in grounding models with richer, ecologically valid data beyond static text or images. The local network's bridge nodes indicate insufficient integration between vision and language modeling paradigms; models often remain siloed despite shared computational frameworks. Further, the exclusion of action and interaction dynamics from vision models impairs faithful modeling of human perception. External/Novel Gaps: The global context analysis identifies 'hidden bridges' not leveraged in current local research. Notably, integrating 'model of human vision' and 'Network models of language' with co-concepts such as human-object interactions, semantic relationships, and pre-trained models reveals an untapped opportunity to fuse language understanding probes with vision-based interaction recognition. Similarly, crossing 'Network models of language' with 'object recognition' and leveraging vision-language models could address limitations in isolated modality modeling. Another overlooked bridge is employing psychophysical data and biological psychology insights to better ground DNNs as scientific models rather than engineering artifacts. These gaps highlight a need for multi-modal, interaction-aware models benchmarked intrinsically against naturalistic human language and vision behavior.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate human-object interaction recognition and semantic relationship analysis (Global Bridge between 'model of human vision' and 'Network models of language') with current language behavior models (Local Thematic Island) to create multi-modal intrinsic benchmarks. This addresses the internal gap of siloed vision and language models and improves ecological validity by embedding language probes in interactive contexts.\n\nOpportunity 2: Employ psychophysical methodologies and biological development principles (Global insights from biomedical and psychological sciences linked to 'deep neural networks' and 'model of human vision') to refine LLM benchmarking probes beyond static text. By incorporating infant learning, maturation, and action-perception cycles (cited as limitations in paper #4), models can be evaluated on their resemblance to human cognitive development.\n\nOpportunity 3: Fuse vision-language pre-trained models with temporal, interaction-aware datasets (Global bridge from 'Network models of language' and 'object recognition') to develop intrinsic benchmarks for LLMs that test alignment of natural language understanding with human-like contextual and visual grounding. This cross-disciplinary approach exploits advances in vision-language datasets (e.g., image captions, interaction categories) to fill the known gap of language models' detached contextual grounding, enhancing intrinsic benchmarking fidelity."
