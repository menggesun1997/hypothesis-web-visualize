    "title": "Chemical-Structural Prompt Encoding for Robust LLM Consistency Evaluation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Standard prompt perturbation methods for behavioral consistency evaluation in LLMs overlook the structural analogies of chemical compounds that could inform more systematic and interpretable robustness tests, limiting evaluation fidelity.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by the hidden bridge linking QSAR and chemical feature encoding to toxicological predictive models, this idea introduces chemical-structural analogs as a novel prompt encoding scheme. It fills the gap of lacking methods bridging distinct paradigms by translating chemical similarity concepts into prompt design for more meaningful intrinsic evaluation of LLMs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a prompt encoding framework where input texts are represented via graph-based chemical structure analogs—encoding syntactic subcomponents as 'molecular fragments' with relational bonds reflecting linguistic dependencies. Generate perturbations by manipulating these fragments similarly to chemical modifications, enabling systematic and interpretable behavioral consistency testing. Evaluate LLM outputs against these chemically inspired prompt variations to assess robustness and intrinsic consistency.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop algorithms to convert sentences into chemical-structure-like graph encodings.\n2. Design perturbation operations analogous to chemical substitutions.\n3. Apply these to generate perturbation datasets for multiple LLMs.\n4. Measure model behavioral consistency and interpret robustness patterns.\n5. Compare with traditional random or paraphrasing perturbation methods.\n6. Analyze interpretability gains and correlation with toxicity or bias metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence \"The patient showed symptoms of fever.\" encoded as a chemical fragment graph.\nPerturbation: Substituting 'fever' fragment with 'cough' akin to chemical substitution.\nExpected Output: LLM outputs reflecting consistent medical reasoning under systematic fragment changes, with robustness quantified by chemical-analog metrics.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If chemical analog encoding proves too coarse, refine branch and bond representations with dependency parse graphs or semantic role labels. Alternatively, develop hybrid encoding combining chemical analogies with attention weights to capture subtle linguistic variations."

        "title": "Integrative Chemical-Structural and Knowledge-Graph Prompt Encoding for Trustworthy LLM Consistency Evaluation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current behavioral consistency evaluations of large language models (LLMs) generally rely on ad hoc prompt perturbations that lack systematic, interpretable frameworks, and largely omit domain-specific semantic and relational knowledge—particularly in biomedical contexts—dampening the fidelity and trustworthiness of robustness assessments.",
        "Motivation": "Building upon the analogy between chemical structure encoding in QSAR modeling and linguistic structure in prompt representations, this work seeks to resolve limitations in prior perturbation methods by precisely integrating chemical-structural analogs with knowledge graph constructions derived from bioactivity data. By embedding semantically rich, domain-grounded relations into prompt encodings and connecting them with trustworthy AI evaluation paradigms (fairness, bias, reliability), this approach aims to fundamentally advance prompt perturbation beyond superficial paraphrasing towards multi-modal, interpretable, and safety-critical LLM robustness testing, thereby establishing a novel paradigm that bridges molecular design principles, knowledge graphs, and trustworthy NLP.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a rigorously formalized framework that encodes input prompts into graph representations inspired by chemical molecular structures combined with domain-specific knowledge graphs from bioactivity datasets, enhancing semantic grounding. Specifically:\n\n1. Linguistic elements (tokens/phrases) are identified as 'molecular fragments' based on a hierarchical linguistic segmentation pipeline that integrates syntactic parse trees and semantic role labels. Each fragment is formally defined as a subgraph node with attributes capturing lexical features.\n\n2. Relational bonds between fragments are constructed algorithmically to reflect syntactic dependencies (e.g., dependency parse edges) and enriched with semantic relations drawn from curated bioactivity knowledge graphs, linking entities and concepts within the prompt.\n\n3. Perturbation operators mirror chemical modifications—such as fragment substitutions, insertions, or deletions—implemented via formally defined graph transformation algorithms guided by molecular design principles (e.g., ring substitutions, side-chain modifications) and constrained by semantic coherence via knowledge graph validation.\n\n4. This multi-modal graph encoding enables generation of structurally and semantically interpretable prompt variants that reflect realistic, chemistry-inspired modifications coupled with domain knowledge:\n   \n   - Algorithms to convert sentences into graphs: pseudo-code formalizes token/fragments extraction and graph assembly.\n   - Quantitative bonding metrics calibrated by linguistic dependency weights and semantic relation confidence scores.\n   - Perturbation functions defined as graph rewrite rules with clear criteria ensuring linguistic and semantic validity.\n\n5. Behavioral consistency and trustworthiness of LLM outputs are evaluated against these perturbations, assessing intrinsic robustness alongside bias and toxicity metrics linked to bioactivity-informed ethical risk assessments.\n\nThis mechanistic clarity ensures reproducibility and rigor while addressing the oversimplification risks inherent in naive chemical analogies, establishing a unique contribution beyond traditional paraphrasing or random perturbation techniques.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop the hierarchical linguistic segmentation pipeline integrating syntactic parsing and semantic role labeling to extract molecular fragment candidates;\n2. Construct formal algorithms to assemble chemical-knowledge hybrid graphs, including bonding quantification and knowledge graph integration mechanisms;\n3. Design and implement graph-based perturbation operators with formal transformation rules reflecting chemical modifications and semantic constraints;\n4. Generate large-scale perturbation datasets for biomedical and toxicological prompt corpora;\n5. Evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs for behavioral consistency across these perturbations, measuring robustness, interpretability, fairness, and bias metrics;\n6. Compare performance and explanatory power against traditional perturbation methods (random, paraphrase-based);\n7. Analyze correlations between chemically informed perturbation impacts and bioactivity-informed toxicity and trustworthiness indicators;\n8. Refine framework iteratively to optimize balance between structural coherence and semantic enrichment;",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: \"The patient showed symptoms of fever.\"\n\n1. Encode as a chemical-structural graph: tokens 'patient', 'showed symptoms', and 'fever' mapped as distinct molecular fragments with dependency bonds linking them, further enriched by bioactivity knowledge graph edges connecting 'fever' with related medical concepts.\n\n2. Perturbation: Substitute the 'fever' fragment with 'cough' via a graph transformation rule resembling a side-chain substitution in molecules, validated against domain knowledge to preserve semantic plausibility.\n\n3. Expected Output: LLM responses should reflect consistent and medically sound reasoning about symptom changes, quantified by similarity metrics over output distributions and evaluated for fairness and toxicity bias.\n\nAdditional cases include perturbations validated against bioactivity toxicological risk graphs to explore ethical and safety dimensions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the full chemical-knowledge graph synthesis proves computationally or conceptually too complex, fallback strategies include:\n\n- Refining the fragment and bond definitions using more advanced dependency parsing enhanced with semantic role labeling alone, sacrificing some knowledge graph integration for simplicity;\n- Employing a hybrid feature encoding combining chemical analogy-based graph features with attention weight distributions extracted from LLM internals to approximate subtle linguistic dependencies;\n- Incrementally integrating trustworthy AI metrics post hoc on perturbation outcomes without full knowledge graph embeddings to ensure robustness correlates with fairness and bias evaluations."
