        "title": "Longitudinal Behavioral Consistency Modeling with Temporal Graph Neural Embeddings for Mental Health Conversational Agents",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing intrinsic evaluations of large language models (LLMs) predominantly focus on acute, isolated validations without adequately capturing their longitudinal behavioral consistency over extended sequences of interactions, especially in critical domains such as mental health support. This gap limits the ability to assess model stability and reliability in dynamic conversational contexts, hindering deployment in scenarios where chronic monitoring and consistent decision-making—like depression detection and suicide prevention—are paramount.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work assesses static or short-term model behaviors, this project advances the state-of-the-art by developing methodologies to quantitatively track LLM behavioral trajectories over time, capturing temporal dynamics and semantic evolution essential for trustworthiness in sensitive applications. By integrating temporal graph neural networks with domain-specific longitudinal evaluation, particularly in mental health conversational agents, our approach addresses novel challenges in chronic condition monitoring and intelligent decision-making, thus significantly elevating the societal and scientific impact of intrinsic evaluation frameworks. This fusion of temporal behavioral modeling with health data science opens new avenues for real-world application and rigorous understanding of LLM consistency.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a rigorous framework to construct and analyze time-evolving behavioral graphs representing LLM outputs in sequential conversational sessions. Specifically:  \n\n1. **Graph Construction:** \n  - **Nodes:** Represent discrete LLM responses at consecutive timepoints within a conversation or across multiple sessions. Each node's feature vector encodes rich semantic and linguistic representations extracted via embeddings such as Sentence-BERT or domain-tuned transformers. Additional metadata (e.g., confidence scores, detected sentiment, or domain-specific markers) augment node features.\n  - **Edges:** Two distinct edge types model temporal and semantic relations:\n    - **Temporal Edges:** Directed edges connect nodes chronologically, capturing progression through time. Edge features encode elapsed time intervals and conversation phase shifts.\n    - **Semantic Shift Edges:** Undirected edges link semantically related but temporally separated nodes, quantified via cosine similarity thresholds or learned metrics highlighting behavioral drift or topical revisitation.\n\n2. **Model Architecture:** \n  - Employ a Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN) combining Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks with attention mechanisms tailored to our behavioral graph, incorporating both temporal order and semantic shifts.\n  - The TGNN leverages time-encoding functions (e.g., Temporal Encoding using Fourier Features) to explicitly model temporal irregularities.\n  - Incorporate modules for drift detection by learning embeddings that emphasize trajectory smoothness and detect abrupt behavioral changes.\n\n3. **Domain Integration for Mental Health:** \n  - Embed specialized features reflecting mental health indicators (e.g., sentiment polarity, linguistic markers of depression) into node attributes.\n  - Utilize domain-adapted embedding layers ensuring sensitivity to clinical language nuances.\n\n4. **Metrics and Evaluation:** \n  - Develop quantitative metrics including trajectory smoothness scores, semantic drift quantification, and longitudinal robustness indices.\n  - Compare behavioral consistency across sessions and models.\n\n5. **Novelty and Rigor:** \n  - Justify choice of TGNN variants as optimal for capturing nuanced temporal-semantic dependencies in behavioral data, contrasting with prior static graph or sequence-only methods.\n  - Discuss limitations such as potential edge sparsity or noise impact and assumptions on conversation continuity.\n\nThis detailed mechanistic design ensures a reproducible, interpretable, and domain-validated methodological advance with clear positioning above existing dynamic graph learning approaches in LLM evaluation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. **Data Collection:** Gather longitudinal conversational datasets from LLM-based mental health assistants, including sessions involving evolving symptom discussions (e.g., depression screening conversations).\n2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract semantic embeddings and mental health indicators from model outputs; design node and edge features accordingly.\n3. **Graph Construction:** Build temporal behavioral graphs with explicitly defined temporal and semantic shift edges following formulated thresholds and encoding strategies.\n4. **Model Implementation:** Develop TGNN architectures combining dynamic GCN layers and temporal attention modules aligned with graph design.\n5. **Training and Prediction:** Train TGNN to embed behavioral trajectories and predict consistency metrics, including abrupt drift detection.\n6. **Baseline Comparison:** Benchmark against static evaluation methods and sequence-only RNN models on longitudinal consistency and mental health task relevance.\n7. **Robustness Testing:** Evaluate on synthetic perturbations emulating domain and temporal shifts.\n8. **Application Validation:** Demonstrate utility by analyzing LLM-assisted depression and suicide risk assessments, correlating detected behavioral drifts with annotation shifts.\n9. **Ablation Studies:** Identify critical components contributing to performance and domain sensitivity.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A multi-session dialogue between an LLM-powered mental health agent and a user reporting progressively worsening depressive symptoms over weeks.  \nExpected Output:  \n- Temporal graph embeddings reflect consistent, smooth behavioral trajectories early on with low drift scores.\n- Detectable increases in semantic drift and trajectory irregularities align temporally with noted changes in user inputs, signaling shifts in model behavior warranting further review.\n- Quantitative longitudinal consistency metrics outperform static baselines in correlating with clinician annotations.\n\nThis demonstrates effectiveness in monitoring LLM behavioral consistency crucial for high-stakes, long-term mental health interventions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If our primary TGNN approach faces challenges such as insufficient temporal edge density or model convergence issues, we will:  \n- Explore recurrent neural networks or transformer-based sequence models applied to pre-constructed graph embeddings to capture temporal dependencies indirectly.\n- Implement contrastive learning objectives designed to differentiate stable from drifted behavioral states across timepoints.\n- Apply smoothing or signal filtering techniques on node embeddings to reduce noise and improve drift detection.\n- Investigate expanding or refining feature sets, including incorporating additional clinical or conversational metadata to better capture domain-relevant longitudinal patterns."

More explicit mechanistic details are needed regarding the construction of the graphs, specifics on node and edge feature design, and how temporal dynamics will be captured and utilized within the GNN architecture. Strengthening this section by including concrete modeling frameworks and justifications would solidify the soundness of the approach and support reproducibility and understanding by reviewers and future implementers. Consider also discussing potential limitations or assumptions inherent in temporal GNN modeling for this domain to demonstrate a rigorous analytical foundation in the mechanism design, beyond high-level conceptual descriptions (e.g., why chosen temporal GNN variants are appropriate). This will ensure that the methodology is well-reasoned and practically executable, addressing the soundness criterion more robustly, especially in a competitive research landscape where clear novelty and rigor are essential to distinguish contributions from prior work in dynamic graph learning and LLM behavioral analysis.
