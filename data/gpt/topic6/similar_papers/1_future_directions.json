        "title": "Bio-Semantic LLM Evaluation via Immunological Benchmarking",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic evaluation metrics of LLMs lack grounding in complex, real-world semantic consistency scenarios. Traditional benchmarks often miss nuanced contextual understanding that biological systems embody, limiting robustness assessment and semantic alignment verification.",
        "Motivation": "This research addresses the critical gap of insular intrinsic evaluation methods that fail to exploit domain-specific grounded data by leveraging immunological studies as a novel biological analogy and benchmark. It expands Opportunity 1 by integrating richly validated semantic consistency checks using tumor immune microenvironment data, linking LLM behavior evaluation with immunological datasets and metrics.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a bio-semantic intrinsic evaluation framework that maps LLM output semantics to immunologically-derived semantic networks representing tumor immune microenvironment interactions. Using LUNA's abstract model combined with these networks, design new consistency and perplexity metrics that quantify LLM semantic coherence against the biological reference frame. Incorporate knowledge graphs constructed from gene-activation datasets, lymphocyte activation pathways, and immune signaling cascades to assess LLM-generated text coherence and anomaly rates.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Construct semantic graphs from tumor immune microenvironment datasets using publicly available immunology resources (e.g., TCGA, ImmPort). 2. Generate LLM outputs conditioned on immunologically relevant prompts requiring precise semantic reasoning. 3. Apply the new bio-semantic evaluation metrics alongside traditional perplexity and self-consistency assessments. 4. Compare evaluation results against standard benchmarks (e.g., GLUE) and biological semantic baselines. 5. Analyze correlation between biological semantic consistency and LLM trustworthiness indicators.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input Prompt: 'Describe the role of lymphocyte activation gene-3 in modulating the tumor microenvironment.' Expected Output: A text that correctly articulates interactions within the immune microenvironment, matching biological pathway semantics. The evaluation metric assigns high semantic consistency scores when LLM output maps correctly to the biological network, indicating robust semantic understanding.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If biological semantic networks prove too complex or noisy, fallback to simplified immunological pathway models or use synthetic immunology-inspired semantic graphs with curated annotations. Alternatively, integrate domain adaptation training for LLMs to better fit immunological data before evaluation."

        "title": "Multimodal Intrinsic Evaluation Harnessing Cytometry-Inspired Data Dimensions",
        "Problem_Statement": "Traditional intrinsic evaluation of LLMs primarily focuses on textual semantic and statistical metrics, lacking incorporation of multimodal and multidimensional signals that can reflect richer LLM behavioral characteristics.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap and Opportunity 2 by incorporating immunological flow cytometry data analysis methodologies to inspire novel multimodal intrinsic evaluation metrics. This approach moves beyond siloed text-only evaluation, enriching LLM assessment with multidimensional perplexity and consistency metrics, informed by cytometric data structures and dynamics.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a multimodal evaluation framework for LLMs that analogizes LLM internal representations and outputs with immunological flow cytometry profiles. Map activation distributions within model layers to multidimensional cytometry-like feature spaces. Then, compute intrinsic metrics modeled on cytometric cluster stability, population heterogeneity, and activation marker consistency to evaluate LLM semantic behavior and robustness. Integrate dimensionality reduction and cluster analysis methods from cytometry for interpreting LLM behavior spaces.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Extract hidden state activations and attention layer outputs from various LLMs when processing complex input prompts. 2. Convert these activations into high-dimensional feature vectors analogous to flow cytometry marker expressions. 3. Apply cytometry-inspired clustering and stability metrics (e.g., silhouette score, population shifts) to characterize LLM internal state consistency. 4. Benchmark these metrics against traditional perplexity and self-consistency measures on established LLM datasets. 5. Evaluate the framework's ability to detect anomalies, hallucinations, or semantic drifts in generated outputs.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A multi-turn dialogue prompt with varying semantic complexity. Expected Outcome: Clustering of LLM internal states reveals distinct stable populations correlating with semantic coherence phases; anomalies manifest as population shifts detected via cytometry-inspired metrics, allowing finer-grained intrinsic evaluation beyond text-only perplexity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If cytometry mapping yields unclear correlations, fallback to synthetic multimodal embeddings combining textual and simulated non-textual signals. Alternatively, use established neural interpretability methods to guide feature selection prior to cytometry-inspired evaluation."

        "title": "Deep Immunology-Inspired Anomaly Detection for LLM Hallucination Control",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current hallucination detection in LLMs relies heavily on semantic metrics and heuristic signals, lacking robust, biologically inspired anomaly detection methods that can improve sensitivity and interpretability.",
        "Motivation": "Targets Opportunity 3 by appropriating deep neural network architectures and anomaly detection mechanisms pioneered in immunological data analysis to enhance LLM hallucination and robustness evaluation. This cross-domain transfer addresses the critical gap of isolated semantic-level evaluation, introducing a biomedical anomaly detection analog to intrinsic LLM evaluation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an LLM hallucination detection system that uses deep autoencoders and variational neural architectures adapted from immunological anomaly detectors (e.g., for lymphocyte activation abnormalities). Train these models on trusted LLM output distributions, using latent space representations sensitive to semantic and syntactic deviations. The system flags hallucinations as anomalies in latent space, incorporating biological-inspired thresholds and uncertainty quantification mechanisms.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble a corpus of verified human-written and trustworthy LLM outputs. 2. Train deep anomaly detection models originally designed for immune cell activation data on this corpus to learn normal output embeddings. 3. Evaluate model performance detecting artificially inserted hallucinations and out-of-distribution outputs. 4. Compare to baseline hallucination detection methods based on perplexity, self-consistency, and semantic similarity. 5. Analyze explainability of anomaly flags with immunology-inspired interpretability tools (e.g., activation maps).",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM-generated answer to a medical question containing fabricated or unsupported facts. Expected Output: The anomaly detection system outputs a high anomaly score indicating hallucination, outperforming conventional perplexity-based flags by providing interpretable activation patterns highlighting suspicious content.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If immunology-based anomaly detectors underperform, fallback to hybrid architectures combining domain-specific detectors with transformer-based uncertainty estimators. Alternatively, simulate synthetic immunological anomaly data to enhance model training robustness."
