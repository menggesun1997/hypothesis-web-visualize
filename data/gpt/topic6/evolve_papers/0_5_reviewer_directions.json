          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks detailed explanation on how intrinsic probing computations can be effectively and meaningfully performed on fully homomorphically encrypted clinical data representations. It is unclear how model interpretability or probing signals can be preserved or extracted without decryption, considering existing homomorphic encryption schemes incur constraints on supported operations and noise accumulation. Clarify the mechanism by which intrinsic benchmarks are computed, the choice of homomorphic encryption schemes, and how data representations and probes adapt to enable transparent and unbiased evaluation without sacrificing interpretability or accuracy of the intrinsic measurements. This will strengthen the soundness of the core approach substantially and address fundamental cryptographic feasibility concerns inherent in the method, which currently appear underspecified and speculative in the description provided, particularly given the computational complexity of such operations on LLM representations in healthcare contexts. Consider referencing or adapting advanced cryptographic protocols known for efficiency or approximate computations to bridge this gap convincingly in the proposal detail section (Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while outlining a reasonable sequence, does not sufficiently address practical feasibility challenges, such as the computational overhead and latency typically associated with homomorphic encryption operations on large-scale clinical LLM embeddings. There is also no concrete plan to measure scalability across multiple institutions or diverse clinical datasets, which is critical for demonstrating real-world applicability. Additional details are needed on dataset selection criteria, encryption parameter settings, intrinsic probe design adaptations, and privacy leakage quantification methods. Also, the fallback plan is a positive inclusion but would benefit from clearer decision criteria or triggers based on empirical performance thresholds (e.g., maximum acceptable encryption overhead or latency). Without these, the experimental validation risks being inconclusive or non-representative of deployment scenarios. Enhance the experimental design with explicit benchmarks, dataset variety, and an end-to-end evaluation strategy that factors in both privacy guarantees and real healthcare practitioner needs to ensure practical feasibility is rigorously tested."
