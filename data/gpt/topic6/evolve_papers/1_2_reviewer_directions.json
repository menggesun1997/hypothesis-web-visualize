    "title": "Real-Time Anomaly Detection Embedded Intrinsic Evaluation in Cloud-Deployed LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs deployed in dynamic, cloud-based environments lack mechanisms for real-time intrinsic evaluation to detect hallucinations or model trustworthiness deterioration proactively.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external gaps of coupling anomaly detection techniques with intrinsic evaluation metrics within cloud environments, enabling continuous, live trustworthiness monitoring of LLMs serving critical applications.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Engineer a streaming intrinsic evaluation pipeline embedded into LLM serving infrastructure that continuously computes perplexity and self-consistency metrics on live queries. Integrate ML-based anomaly detection models trained on historical intrinsic metric distributions to flag unusual behavior. The system triggers alerts and adaptive actions such as query rejection or model switching, allowing real-time trustworthiness control at scale.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Deploy an LLM service on a cloud platform with monitoring hooks. 2) Simulate real-world query streams including adversarial and out-of-distribution inputs. 3) Develop anomaly detection models using unsupervised clustering and temporal pattern mining on intrinsic metric time series. 4) Measure detection accuracy, latency, and impact on service quality. 5) Conduct user studies on alert usefulness and system responsiveness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A sudden spike of queries containing misleading or ambiguous inputs. Output: The system detects anomalies in intrinsic metrics signaling hallucination risk and flags or throttles affected queries to prevent misinformation propagation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If anomaly detection yields excessive false positives, refine feature engineering incorporating additional signals like user feedback or confidence calibrations. Alternatively, deploy a hybrid approach combining threshold and ML-based detection."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section would benefit from elaboration on the real-time integration specifics: how are intrinsic metrics like perplexity and self-consistency computed efficiently at scale without impacting LLM serving latency? Also, it is not fully clear how ML-based anomaly detection models are continuously updated or retrained in the dynamic cloud environment to adapt to distributional shifts. Providing a clearer architectural overview with detailed mechanism for anomaly signal extraction, model updating, and triggering adaptive actions will strengthen the soundness of the proposal's core technical approach by removing ambiguity in its operational flow and resource trade-offs. Such clarity is crucial for convincing the feasibility and practical deployment viability of the method in real-world cloud LLM systems, where latency and reliability constraints are very stringent, especially in critical applications. Consider integrating detailed algorithmic steps or system design diagrams illustrating how streaming intrinsic evaluations seamlessly integrate with anomaly detection and adaptive control loops, highlighting any novel components or optimizations that differentiate from existing monitoring solutions in LLM pipelines or related AI systems frameworks. This will also help reviewers and implementers grasp the novelty and technical contribution more concretely, beyond the combination of known components described currently. Target: Proposed_Method section to include more mechanistic and implementation detail on real-time pipeline, anomaly modeling and adaptive control loops."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the 'NOV-COMPETITIVE' novelty rating, the proposal can be strengthened by integrating concepts from 'Responsible Artificial Intelligence' and 'intelligent decision-making' from the global concept list. Specifically, enriching the anomaly detection pipeline with causal reasoning or interpretable decision-layer components can enable the system not only to flag anomalous behavior but explain why the LLM output is suspected to be hallucinating or unreliable. This human-understandable feedback can improve practical usability and trust for downstream users operating critical applications. Furthermore, coupling the intrinsic metric anomaly signals with a multi-agent system framework could enable the switching or voting among multiple model instances (possibly domain-adapted or fine-tuned) to enhance robustness. Such a reasoning/decision layer that leverages vision-language or multi-modal signals (where applicable) to corroborate text-based anomalies could further broaden the impact and novelty, making it distinct from existing anomaly detection methods focusing purely on intrinsic text metrics. These extensions will deepen the idea's alignment with responsible AI goals and intelligent autonomous system design, addressing real-world challenges of transparency, trust, and automated recovery in cloud-deployed LLMs."
