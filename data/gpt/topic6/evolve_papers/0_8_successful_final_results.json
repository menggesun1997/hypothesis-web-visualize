        "title": "Explainability-Driven Intrinsic Benchmarking with Multimodal Counterfactual Clinical Text Generation and Cognitive Alignment",
        "Problem_Statement": "Interpretability of intrinsic benchmarks in healthcare large language models (LLMs) remains limited due to the complex interplay of clinical and demographic variables in clinical texts, posing challenges for reliable attribution of model biases and comprehension failures. Existing intrinsic evaluations often overlook confounding factors that obscure causal insights, reducing trustworthiness in high-stakes healthcare decisions. There is a critical need for rigorous frameworks that not only generate clinically plausible counterfactuals to isolate sources of bias but also integrate human expert cognitive patterns to validate and enhance model explainability in intrinsic benchmarking.",
        "Motivation": "This work addresses fundamental gaps in intrinsic benchmark interpretability for healthcare LLMs by introducing a theoretically grounded framework that leverages counterfactual clinical text generation combined with multimodal cognitive data, specifically clinician eye-tracking, to disentangle and validate sources of bias and failure modes. By explicitly modeling causal assumptions and grounding explanations in human expert attention patterns, the approach seeks to intrinsically reveal model reasoning boundaries more robustly and transparently than prior art. This integration enhances the novelty and clinical relevance of intrinsic evaluation frameworks, opening avenues for broader applications including mental health settings and intelligent decision support systems, thus advancing state-of-the-art interpretable healthcare AI.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-stage methodology: (1) Theoretical causal validation of counterfactual generation assumptions using domain expert-defined causal graphs and statistical sensitivity analyses to ensure clinical plausibility and isolate confounding effects; (2) Controlled counterfactual clinical text generation modifying key demographic (e.g., ethnicity, gender) and clinical attributes guided by biomedical ontologies and pretrained controlled generation models fine-tuned with expert-in-the-loop validation, ensuring linguistic coherence and clinical fidelity; (3) Intrinsic probing of healthcare LLMs through these counterfactuals measuring output variability and deriving interpretable bias indices with statistical controls for confounders; (4) Integration of multimodal human cognition data by collecting eye gaze/eye-tracking recordings from clinicians reviewing original and counterfactual texts to map human attention shifts, thereby cross-validating model sensitivity patterns; (5) Explainability report generation synthesizing intrinsic probe outputs and cognitive alignment metrics to highlight model biases and failure modes with interpretable, human-grounded rationale; (6) Extension pathways include deploying the framework in mental health clinical notes and embedding within intelligent decision-making pipelines for real-world impact. This fusion of causal validation, controlled counterfactuals, and human cognitive alignment differentiates our approach with enhanced robustness and credibility.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collaborate with clinical domain experts to define causal graphs of demographic and clinical variables relevant for counterfactual generation to underpin theoretical assumptions; 2) Develop and fine-tune pretrained controlled text generation models with biomedical ontologies to produce linguistically coherent and clinically plausible counterfactual clinical texts; 3) Implement a human-in-the-loop annotation protocol with clinician validation employing standardized guidelines to evaluate plausibility and coherence of generated texts; 4) Conduct intrinsic probing experiments by feeding original and counterfactual texts into healthcare LLMs and quantify output variability with bias indices carefully defined to control for confounding factors using multivariate statistical models; 5) Collect eye-tracking data from a representative cohort of clinicians reviewing paired original and counterfactual texts during reading and comprehension tasks, ensuring sufficient sample size for statistical power; 6) Analyze gaze data to identify shifts in attention and correlate these with model output sensitivities to assess cognitive alignment; 7) Perform user studies with clinicians to evaluate the interpretability, clinical relevance, and trustworthiness of combined explainability reports, employing validated evaluation scales and qualitative feedback; 8) Incorporate risk mitigation strategies such as fallback expert review and sensitivity analyses; 9) Document experimental protocols thoroughly to facilitate reproducibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: Input: A clinical note describing a patient diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, annotated with patient gender 'male'; Counterfactual: Same note with patient gender changed to 'female' maintaining clinical consistency; Expected Outcome: Intrinsic probes quantify changes in LLM output semantics indicating sensitivity to gender attribute; eye-tracking data shows shifts in clinician attention towards gender-relevant clinical features; explainability report highlights gender-related bias with transparent rationale. \n\nExample 2: Input: Mental health clinical note containing diagnosis and treatment recommendations for a patient with depression; Counterfactual: Modified note altering patient's ethnicity attribute while preserving clinical context; Expected Outcome: Measured output variability identifies potential ethnic bias; cognitive alignment confirms human expert attention modulation; interpretability report contextualizes findings for clinical stakeholders.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If controlled counterfactual generation struggles to meet clinical plausibility or linguistic coherence thresholds, fallback includes: integrating iterative expert-in-the-loop rephrasing cycles with detailed annotation guidelines to refine outputs; utilizing ensemble approaches combining multiple pretrained controlled generation models specialized in biomedical language; or adopting post-hoc automated natural language quality metrics and biomedical concept consistency checks to filter low-quality generations. For eye-tracking data collection challenges (e.g., equipment constraints or participant recruitment), alternatives involve complementing with validated cognitive task performance metrics or leveraging publicly available eye gaze datasets in related clinical NLP tasks. Sensitivity analyses and ablation studies will ensure robustness of conclusions despite fallback adaptations."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that intrinsic benchmarks' interpretability can be significantly enhanced through counterfactual clinical text generation needs stronger justification or preliminary evidence. Clinical texts are highly complex and nuanced; changing demographic or clinical attributes might not always isolate bias or reasoning failures cleanly, especially since multiple confounding factors often intertwine in real data. Clarify how counterfactual generation will reliably disentangle these influences to provide trustworthy explainability rather than introducing spurious correlations or artifacts. Explicitly address potential assumptions on causal validity of counterfactuals within clinical contexts to strengthen soundness of this key premise. This is critical in healthcare settings where stakes of incorrect bias attribution are high, so assumptions here must be rigorously grounded and critically discussed within Proposed_Method and Problem_Statement sections to avoid conceptual fragility and promote model interpretability credibility and robustness. Consider adding a dedicated theoretical discussion or validation step early in the work to vet this assumption rigorously before downstream experiments proceed in Experiment_Plan section to build strong foundation for subsequent claims and analyses.  \n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is generally clear but lacks concrete methodological details that ensure feasibility and scientific rigor. For example, the counterfactual generation step needs elaboration on how to guarantee clinical plausibility and linguistic coherence of generated texts, beyond fallback plans involving experts or pretrained controlled models. Specify metrics and validation protocols for these aspects, such as human annotation guidelines, quality benchmarks, or automated evaluation methods. Further, correlation of output variability with bias indices requires careful statistical modeling and definition of bias indices tailored to clinical contexts; the plan should mention control for confounders or confirm robustness to sample heterogeneity. The proposed user studies with clinicians are crucial but need details on evaluation criteria and sample size considerations to ensure meaningful assessment of explainability. Overall, strengthen the experimental plan with more operational details, validation checkpoints, and risk mitigation strategies to enhance practical feasibility. Clarifying these points will increase confidence that the experimental workflow can deliver interpretable, clinically relevant insights within reasonable resource constraints. \n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

This multimodal extension could ground the counterfactual probing in human cognitive attention patterns, providing richer explainability insights and aligning AI biases with human expert reasoning.
