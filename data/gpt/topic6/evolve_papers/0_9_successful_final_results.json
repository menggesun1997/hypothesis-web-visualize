        "title": "Knowledge-Grounded Trustworthy Intrinsic Probing Incorporating Medical Ontologies, Graph Data Management, and Federated Privacy",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic benchmarks for federated healthcare large language models (LLMs) lack comprehensive integration of structured medical knowledge with rigorous trustworthiness criteria such as robustness and explainability. This gap limits semantic depth, interpretability, and trustworthy evaluation of federated healthcare LLMs while ensuring privacy.",
        "Motivation": "Building upon prior intrinsic probing approaches, this work advances novelty and impact by tightly coupling ontology-driven semantic constraints with trustworthy machine learning principles—robustness, explainability—and graph-based data management techniques for scalable and interpretable ontology reasoning under federated privacy. By embedding medical ontologies (e.g., SNOMED CT) via graph neural networks and formal trustworthiness metrics into intrinsic probes, the framework offers superior semantic adherence detection, bias discovery, and privacy preservation. This innovative fusion enhances fairness, semantic richness, and trustworthy evaluation beyond existing ontology-informed probing methods, addressing critical gaps in healthcare AI.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid intrinsic probing architecture operating within federated learning environments that integrates ontology reasoning modules based on graph neural networks (GNNs) and symbolic reasoning to enforce semantic constraints. Federated clients locally encode clinical text outputs and ontology subgraphs using graph embeddings. A dual reasoning mechanism combines embedding-based semantic similarity with lightweight symbolic logic constraints derived from medical ontologies to guide probe outputs.\n\nPrivacy is ensured by encrypting graph embeddings via secure multi-party computation protocols before aggregation, preventing data leakage. Intrinsic probes leverage this enhanced ontology-guided representation to quantitatively assess semantic consistency, bias deviation, and robustness against adversarial perturbations. Explainability modules generate human-understandable counterfactuals highlighting ontology-based semantic discrepancies.\n\nThis modular design is formalized with pseudocode and a conceptual diagram elucidating data flow and reasoning integration tightly coupled within the probing pipeline, demonstrating a reproducible, novel approach that outperforms existing ontology-agnostic and purely symbolic probing techniques while preserving federated privacy.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate diverse federated clinical datasets linked with rich medical ontologies (e.g., SNOMED CT). 2) Implement ontology reasoning modules using GNNs trained to capture ontology structure and semantics at each client.\n3) Integrate symbolic logic constraints to enforce domain rules within intrinsic probes.\n4) Develop privacy-preserving protocols (e.g., secure aggregation) for federated embedding exchange.\n5) Deploy hybrid intrinsic probes within the federated framework.\n6) Evaluate semantic consistency, bias metrics, robustness to adversarial perturbations, and explainability scores.\n7) Benchmark against ontology-agnostic, non-trustworthy intrinsic probes and centralized ontology reasoning baselines.\n8) Conduct ablation studies isolating graph embedding, symbolic reasoning, and federated privacy components.\n9) Analyze scalability and interpretability impacts from graph data management.\n10) Document and release code and conceptual schemata for reproducibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical notes distributed across federated clients referencing medical concepts.\nExpected Output: Intrinsic probe produces (a) semantic consistency scores aligned with ontology constraints indicating correct medical concept usage,\n(b) bias and robustness metrics revealing systematic deviations or vulnerabilities,\n(c) explainable reports with ontology-grounded counterfactuals demonstrating semantic errors,\nall computed without exposing raw clinical data.\nExample: For a note incorrectly associating symptoms with a disease category, the probe flags semantic incoherence per SNOMED CT relations while preserving client data privacy.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full integration of symbolic logic and graph-based ontology reasoning proves technically infeasible, fallback to (a) embedding-only ontology proxies using precomputed graph embeddings with partial constraint enforcement, and (b) simplified trustworthiness metrics such as fairness and basic robustness scores. Additionally, employ differential privacy mechanisms over embedding exchanges to maintain privacy guarantees. Iteratively incorporate more complex reasoning modules in future extensions as technical and resource constraints permit."

Clarify how ontological constraints will be operationalized to influence probe outputs, particularly within privacy-preserving federated settings, to strengthen methodological soundness and reproducibility prospects. Specify the reasoning techniques (e.g., symbolic logic reasoning, embedding-based constraints) and their tight coupling with intrinsic probing modules to convincingly justify the approach's validity and efficacy in capturing semantic adherence and bias detection without leaking private data. This will also help differentiate the method from existing ontology-informed probing approaches in competitive literature, addressing both assumption validation and mechanistic clarity concerns in 'Proposed_Method'.  \n\n\"Proposed_Method\" section should be expanded accordingly to detail this integration clearly and unambiguously, potentially including a conceptual diagram or pseudocode for the hybrid intrinsic probe architecture integrating ontological constraints under federated privacy."

For instance, embedding formal trustworthiness criteria such as robustness and explainability metrics alongside semantic consistency could provide a more holistic evaluation of federated healthcare LLMs. Additionally, exploiting graph-based knowledge management methods could enable more scalable and interpretable incorporation of comprehensive medical ontologies beyond SNOMED CT, potentially leveraging graph embeddings or graph neural networks tailored for ontology reasoning. This integration would position the work at the intersection of knowledge discovery, trustworthy AI, and advanced data management, boosting the work's broader relevance and competitive edge. Include these aspects either as enhancements to the experimental plan or as future directions to strategically deepen and scope the proposal's innovation frontier beyond the current narrowly defined probing task."
