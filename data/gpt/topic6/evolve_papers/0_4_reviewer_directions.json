    "title": "Multimodal Depth-Aware Language Probing for Enhanced Clinical Concept Representation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Intrinsic benchmarking of healthcare LLMs ignores spatial and structural depth information available in clinical videos and images, limiting comprehension of complex pathological presentations.",
    "Motivation": "Exploits the 'hidden bridge' of monocular depth estimation in video-based deep learning to create depth-aware multimodal intrinsic probes that enrich language understanding benchmarking by encoding spatial context, filling an external gap about multimodal joint video understanding and intrinsic evaluation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Integrate monocular depth signals extracted from clinical video or imaging modalities into LLM intrinsic probes, correlating depth features with textual descriptions to measure spatial-semantic alignment and concept grounding within the LLM's representations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect clinical endoscopy or procedural video with synchronized text notes. 2) Extract monocular depth maps and generate depth-annotated semantic probes. 3) Incorporate these into intrinsic evaluations of LLM embeddings. 4) Benchmark on spatial understanding tasks against traditional text-only probes. 5) Metrics: correlation alignment score, intrinsic comprehension metrics, downstream diagnostic accuracy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Endoscopic video frame with depth map plus associated clinical text about lesion location; Expected Output: Probe flags strong alignment between spatial depth cues and textual concept representations within the LLM.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If depth estimation noise corrupts probes, explore simplified spatial features like segmentation masks or anatomical landmark embeddings to capture structural context for intrinsic benchmarking."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes integrating monocular depth signals into intrinsic probes for LLMs, but it lacks clarity on how exactly these depth features will be encoded, aligned, and correlated with textual representations. The operational details of embedding depth information within language model embeddings or probing methods are not fully articulated. Concrete mechanisms (e.g., model architectures, feature fusion strategies, or similarity metrics) should be detailed to confirm the soundness of the approach and guide reproducibility and evaluation rigorously. Without this, the method risks being conceptually appealing but practically vague and underspecified, weakening the soundness of the contribution. Please clarify and expand on the mechanistic integration steps and formulation of the depth-text alignment measurement within the LLM framework in the Proposed_Method section, including any assumptions on data formats, model access levels, or probe construction steps that support the method's validity and reproducibility."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict, the proposal could consider integrating 'graph neural networks' (GNN) to model the spatial and anatomical relationships among entities derived from depth and segmentation information. By representing spatially situated clinical concepts and depth cues as graph-structured data, the intrinsic probes could exploit relational inductive biases for improved grounding and interpretability. This integration could augment the multimodal depth-aware probing approach by enabling structured reasoning over the anatomical graph representations, potentially enhancing the impact and novelty beyond current monocular depth estimation fusion methods. Exploring this could also align well with downstream diagnostic tasks requiring spatial context reasoning. Consider outlining a preliminary plan to incorporate GNN models or similar structures to capture anatomical and spatial relations as part of the Proposed_Method or future work."
