    "title": "Multimodal Intrinsic Probes Incorporating Clinical Imaging and Text for LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs evaluated only by textual intrinsic probes miss holistic comprehension needed in healthcare, which relies on joint interpretation of language and images. Existing benchmarks fail to capture integrated understanding of clinical multimodal data.",
    "Motivation": "Leverages hidden bridge between joint video synthesis/monocular depth estimation and medical language understanding to create novel multimodal intrinsic probes, addressing the external gap of lacking rich multimodal intrinsic benchmarks and enhancing explainability in clinical contexts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multimodal intrinsic probe suite combining clinical image features (X-rays, MRIs) and associated textual reports. Construct joint representation tasks such as cross-modal entailment, diagnostic consistency, and clinically relevant multimodal attribute extraction embedded in the probe.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect paired medical imaging and textual report datasets (e.g., CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR). 2) Fine-tune multimodal LLM architectures (e.g., visual-linguistic transformers). 3) Design multimodal intrinsic probes with attribute alignment and diagnostic reasoning probes. 4) Benchmark against text-only LLM intrinsic probes and vision-only diagnostic models. 5) Metrics: multimodal understanding accuracy, intrinsic evaluation correlations, explainability scores.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Chest X-ray image and its report text snippet referencing 'cardiomegaly'; Expected Output: Probe detects consistent diagnostic concept understanding across modalities with high confidence scores, illustrating integrated comprehension.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal probes underperform, modularize into sequential unimodal intrinsic assessments followed by a fusion consistency evaluation or incorporate video-based depth estimation inspired features as auxiliary inputs to boost multimodal signal."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a multimodal intrinsic probe suite combining clinical images and textual reports. However, the description lacks clarity on how the joint representation tasks (cross-modal entailment, diagnostic consistency, attribute extraction) will be concretely formulated and operationalized. Clear definitions of task objectives, loss functions, and how these contribute to intrinsic evaluation metrics are needed to ensure the mechanism is sound and reproducible. Please elaborate the method details, specifying model architectures, training protocols, and probe design with concrete examples to clarify how the approach directly probes multimodal understanding in LLMs within clinical contexts, beyond existing vision-language methods. This will strengthen the overall soundness and interpretability of the method.  (Target: Proposed_Method) "

          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screening novelty result (NOV-COMPETITIVE) and the links with 'computer vision' and 'neural network', a promising way to enhance impact and distinctiveness would be to integrate self-supervised or contrastive learning techniques from neural networks—particularly those advanced in computer vision—to enrich the multimodal probe representations. For example, leveraging contrastive objectives to better align textual and imaging embeddings could improve robustness and explainability. This integration could also extend the probes to include temporal dynamics in video-based clinical data or 3D volumetric imaging, thus broadening the scope beyond 2D images and static text. Such additions would capitalize on globally trending neural approaches and computer vision advances, positioning this work with clearer scientific novelty and broader applicability.
