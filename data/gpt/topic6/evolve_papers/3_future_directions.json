        "title": "BioRisk-LLM: Infusing Dose-Response Modelling into Behavioral Consistency Metrics for LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "There is a significant lack of intrinsic evaluation frameworks that integrate biological dose-response principles to assess LLM behavior and robustness. Current models fail to provide interpretable, quantitative thresholds of behavioral deviation akin to toxicological benchmarks, limiting understanding of model risk under adversarial or noisy input.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the critical gap of missing cross-disciplinary evaluation by synthesizing dose-response toxicological modeling with LLM behavioral consistency metrics. This novel approach leverages 'hidden bridge' insights to introduce risk thresholding concepts to AI evaluation, fulfilling the call for robust, interpretable testing paradigms.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop BioRisk-LLM, a behavioral evaluation framework that treats input perturbations as 'dose' increments and measures model response deviations as 'toxicity' analogs. Establish a dose-response curve for LLM output consistency using controlled perturbations ranging from benign to adversarial noise. Define behavioral tolerance thresholds analogous to TDI values, enabling risk categorization of model responses. Integrate statistical dose-response models (e.g., benchmark dose modeling) to fit behavioral data and estimate benchmark behavioral deviation doses (BBDDs).",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select representative LLMs (e.g., GPT-3, PaLM).\n2. Design perturbation schemes (syntactic noise, semantic paraphrases, adversarial examples) with quantifiable intensities.\n3. Collect response outputs and define behavioral deviation metrics (e.g., semantic similarity drop, consistency score).\n4. Fit dose-response models to quantify behavioral risk thresholds.\n5. Evaluate framework robustness across datasets (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE).\n6. Compare against baseline intrinsic evaluation metrics without dose-response integration.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Original question \"What is the capital of France?\" (dose=0)\nPerturbation: Paraphrase with spelling mistakes increasing noise dose\nOutput: Consistent answer \"Paris\" at low doses, deviation or errors at high doses\nExpected: Dose-response curve showing increasing behavioral inconsistency beyond a benchmark dose~0.3 noise intensity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If dose-response curve fitting is unstable, explore non-parametric smoothing techniques or quantile regression for estimating behavioral thresholds. Alternatively, employ Bayesian hierarchical modeling to capture uncertainty in behavioral risk estimation."

        "title": "ImmunoAdversarial-LLM: Leveraging Th17 Cell Sensitivity Analogies for Subtle Vulnerability Detection in LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Standard adversarial robustness tests miss subtle, biologically analogous vulnerabilities present in LLM behavior, akin to nuanced immunological responses seen in Th17 cell pathways. Detecting these faint yet consequential model fragilities remains an unresolved challenge.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the 'hidden bridge' connecting immunological sensitivity analyses with AI robustness testing, this project aims to explore immunology-based frameworks to discover fine-grained adversarial weaknesses in LLMs, addressing the core critical gap of subtle vulnerability detection.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Model adversarial perturbations using immunological response analogs, treating subtle input changes like antigen presentations impacting Th17 cell activation thresholds. Develop immune-inspired sensitivity metrics reflecting LLM behavioral shifts in response to minimal input perturbations. Implement an adversarial test suite that probes these thresholds systematically to uncover hidden failure modes.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Survey immunological sensitivity measurement techniques focused on Th17 cells.\n2. Formalize analogies to define 'activation thresholds' in LLM responses.\n3. Construct adversarial example generators guided by these thresholds.\n4. Evaluate on benchmark tasks with stress testing of LLM stability.\n5. Cross-validate findings with human expert assessment on subtle semantic shifts.\n6. Compare immuno-inspired method performance to traditional adversarial attacks.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"The cat sat on the mat.\"\nPerturbation: Slight synonym swap \"The feline sat on the mat.\" designed to cross activation threshold.\nExpected Output: Detection of semantic drift or inconsistency indicating subtle vulnerability revealed by immuno-inspired metrics.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct immunology analogies fail to yield detection improvements, pivot to hybrid approaches that combine gradient-based adversarial analysis with statistical outlier detection inspired by immune exclusion principles."

        "title": "Uncertainty-Benchmark: Adapting Toxicological Benchmark Dose Approaches to Quantify LLM Robustness Confidence",
        "Problem_Statement": "Intrinsic evaluation lacks integration of uncertainty quantification combined with robustness metrics for LLMs, resulting in opaque confidence assessments and non-interpretable reliability estimates under environmental variability.",
        "Motivation": "Fulfills the identified high-potential innovation opportunity to transplant benchmark dose methodologies and uncertainty quantification techniques from toxicology into LLM intrinsic evaluation, filling a core gap in reliable confidence estimation frameworks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design an evaluation framework that models LLM robustness tests as dose-response functions and incorporates uncertainty quantification (e.g., Bayesian credible intervals) around behavioral metrics. Establish benchmark behavioral doses with confidence bounds to signify ranges of model reliability. Use probabilistic modeling to handle external environmental variability reflecting input distribution shifts.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Implement perturbation-based testing pipelines on multiple LLMs.\n2. Measure behavioral responses with uncertainty-aware metrics (e.g., Bayesian credible sets for output consistency).\n3. Fit benchmark dose models including uncertainty quantification.\n4. Evaluate performance on diverse NLP benchmarks with varying environmental noise profiles.\n5. Compare with deterministic baseline metrics missing uncertainty awareness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Question answering sentences with stochastic paraphrase perturbations.\nOutput: Behavioral consistency scores with Bayesian intervals indicating confidence.\nExpected: Identification of perturbation doses where model reliability drops with quantified uncertainty margins.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If Bayesian methods lead to computational overhead, simplify to bootstrap resampling techniques for empirical uncertainty estimation or adopt frequentist confidence intervals as a stopgap."

        "Problem_Statement": "There is a fundamental lack of interdisciplinary evaluation benchmarks or frameworks merging toxicology risk assessment methods and LLM intrinsic evaluation, causing missed opportunities for methodology transfer and innovation.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the critical internal gap of missing bridge concepts by explicitly designing and validating a new cross-domain evaluation framework fusing toxicological exposure models and AI behavioral robustness tests.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a formal evaluation framework with a shared ontology aligning toxicological exposure concepts (dose, threshold, sensitivity) with LLM evaluation attributes (input perturbation magnitude, behavioral deviation, vulnerability). Develop composite benchmarks incorporating toxicology inspired metrics into NLP robustness evaluations, supported by a new toolchain enabling joint analysis.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Extract key toxicology risk assessment components amenable to AI evaluation translation.\n2. Define mapping to LLM behavioral test constructs.\n3. Create datasets simulating dose-like perturbation gradients.\n4. Evaluate multiple LLMs across these datasets with the dual-domain metrics.\n5. Analyze framework effectiveness in exposing behavioral vulnerabilities missed by traditional NLP robustness tests.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example: Equate BPA exposure dose measures with controlled perturbation intensity in text inputs, and measure LLM response degradation analogous to immunotoxic responses.\nExpected: Identification of behaviorally vulnerable perturbation regions interpreted via toxicology analogs.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct domain mapping proves overly complex, focus on modular components, first validating individual toxicology-inspired metrics independently before full framework integration."
