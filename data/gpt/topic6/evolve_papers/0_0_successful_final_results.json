        "title": "Compliance-Aware Bias-Resilient Federated Probing Framework for Healthcare LLMs with Continual AI Safety Monitoring",
        "Problem_Statement": "Healthcare LLMs often encode demographic and social biases, risking unfair medical decision support. Existing intrinsic benchmarking methods lack integrated bias assessment within privacy-preserving distributed training contexts and do not address compliance with healthcare data regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), limiting trustworthy and lawful deployment.",
        "Motivation": "This work bridges intrinsic bias benchmarking and privacy-preserving federated learning by proposing a bias-aware probing framework embedded into federated healthcare LLM training. We emphasize novel technical integration mechanisms for secure bias probing, and extend the framework with compliance-aware auditability and continual AI safety monitoring to ensure robustness, privacy, and fairness are maintained throughout deployment. By linking benchmarking outputs explicitly to region-specific legal privacy requirements, our solution surpasses existing work in operational readiness and regulatory alignment, enhancing novelty and impact in sensitive healthcare domains.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We design a federated intrinsic bias probing protocol that tightly integrates bias assessment probes with federated training rounds while preserving privacy and regulatory compliance. Our approach includes: 1) Embedding bias probes as auxiliary model evaluation tasks executed locally each federated round that quantify demographic biases using metrics like equalized odds gap and demographic parity on sensitive attribute-perturbed clinical text samples. 2) Secure aggregation of encrypted bias metrics using threshold homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation protocols to aggregate individual client bias signals without exposing sensitive data. 3) Differential privacy mechanisms applied to bias metric reports with tunable privacy parameters balancing privacy leakage risks against bias detection sensitivity, supported by a formal privacy budget accounting framework. 4) Compliance module that generates cryptographically verifiable audit trails linking each federated roundâ€™s privacy and bias statistics to regulatory standards (GDPR, HIPAA), enabling external audits and operational compliance monitoring. 5) A continual AI safety monitoring sub-system that, post-deployment, performs real-time user interaction risk assessment and privacy leakage detection via on-device federated probes running on clinical LLM outputs, providing alerts and adaptive mitigation strategies. We provide detailed pseudocode workflows and a system architecture diagram illustrating the interplay between federated training, bias probing, privacy protection, compliance auditing, and continual monitoring under realistic resource constraints. This holistic integration innovatively combines NLP-based bias detection, privacy-preserving distributed computation, legal compliance, and AI safety into a unified federated healthcare AI framework.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Use federated medical datasets across simulated hospitals (e.g., MIMIC, eICU) with sensitive attribute annotations. 2) Deploy GPT variants or healthcare-specific LLMs in a realistic federated setup with communication constraints. 3) Implement bias probes measuring demographic bias (gender, race) on clinical NLP tasks via both original and synthetically perturbed inputs. 4) Integrate threshold homomorphic encryption and differential privacy during federated aggregation of bias and utility metrics, tuning privacy-utility trade-offs under healthcare compliance constraints. 5) Develop compliance audit trail generation and verification modules for GDPR/HIPAA alignment; test with simulated regulatory audits. 6) Enable continual AI safety monitoring on post-deployment LLM outputs with user interaction logs to evaluate privacy risks and bias drift. 7) Compare against baselines including centralized bias auditing, blind federated learning without probing, and non-compliance-aware federated setups. 8) Quantify metrics: fairness (equalized odds difference, demographic parity), intrinsic language understanding scores, privacy leakage (membership inference attack success), compliance audit completeness, and detection latency of safety monitoring.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical discharge notes with embedded patient demographic information submitted across federated sites. Expected Outcome: The intrinsic bias probes detect minimal biased associations between demographics and diagnoses with high confidence, confirmed via secure aggregated bias metrics protected by differential privacy parameters ensuring no privacy leakage. Simulated GDPR compliance audits successfully verify cryptographically provable audit trails tied to federated training rounds. Post-deployment continual monitoring detects no significant privacy risks or bias drift during user interactions, demonstrating resilience and safety. System maintains end-to-end privacy and fairness guarantees under real-world communication and computation constraints.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated bias evaluation signals prove excessively noisy, fallback to local bias audits on anonymized synthetic proxy data shared under strict privacy agreements for controlled cross-validation. If secure aggregation or differential privacy mechanisms impact utility or latency beyond acceptable thresholds, incrementally relax privacy budgets while documenting implications. In case cryptographic audit trail generation poses engineering challenges, implement modular compliance verification via external monitoring tools integrating federated logs with healthcare compliance platforms. For continual monitoring, if on-device probes are infeasible, perform periodic centralized risk assessments on aggregated interaction metadata with enhanced anonymization. These measured fallback strategies ensure core objectives of privacy, bias detection, and compliance can still be met in degraded environments."

For example, how bias probes will be computed and aggregated securely without leaking sensitive data is not clearly specified. Consider clarifying the mechanism for: (1) embedding bias probes within federated rounds, (2) communication protocols for bias-related metrics, and (3) how differential privacy parameters balance bias detection sensitivity versus privacy leakage. Adding pseudocode or a workflow diagram could enhance clarity and demonstrate soundness of the approach's internal logic and feasibility under real-world resource constraints. This is critical because improper integration risks either privacy breaches or ineffective bias measurement, undermining both core goals of the framework. Addressing this would improve confidence in the method's soundness and practical applicability under healthcare data constraints, which is essential for trustworthy deployment in sensitive domains like medicine. Targeting the Proposed_Method section will maximize impact on internal coherence and validity of the idea."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and the global concepts such as AI safety, GDPR, and deployment of AI systems, a concrete way to enhance impact and novelty is to explicitly incorporate compliance verification with region-specific privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) into the federated probing framework. This could involve devising audit trails or formal guarantees linking the bias-resilient benchmarking outputs to legal privacy requirements, thereby positioning the method as not only a technical contribution but also an operational compliance tool. Furthermore, expanding the framework to support continual monitoring in deployed healthcare AI systems, integrating risk assessment for sensitive information leakage during user interactions, would broaden applicability and emphasize AI safety and robustness aspects. This integration could differentiate the proposal by showcasing practical readiness for regulatory and deployment challenges in healthcare AI, beyond academic benchmarking settings. Aligning with these globally linked concepts can substantially elevate the workâ€™s significance and reception in premier AI/ML venues."
