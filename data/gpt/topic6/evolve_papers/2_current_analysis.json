It is potentially one of the next steps in revolutionizing human interaction with food. The modern advent of big data and the development of data-oriented fields like deep learning have provided advancements in food category recognition. With increasing computational power and ever-larger food datasets, the approach's potential has yet to be realized. This survey provides an overview of methods that can be applied to various food category recognition tasks, including detecting type, ingredients, quality, and quantity. We survey the core components for constructing a machine learning system for food category recognition, including datasets, data augmentation, hand-crafted feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms. We place a particular focus on the field of deep learning, including the utilization of convolutional neural networks, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning. We provide an overview of relevant studies to promote further developments in food category recognition for research and industrial applications.\"}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Missing Value Imputation Methods for Electronic Health Records', 'abstract': 'Electronic health records (EHR) are patient-level information, e.g., laboratory tests and questionnaires, stored in electronic format. Compared to physical records, the EHR alternative allows patients to access their data easily and helps staff with management procedural tasks such as information sharing across different organizations. Moreover, this type of data is commonly used by researchers for predictive and classification purposes, employing statistical and machine learning methods. However, missingness is a phenomenon that is observed very frequently for such measurements. Even though this missingness is often significant, it is usually treated poorly with either case deletion or simple methods, resulting in suboptimal and/or inaccurate predictive results. This happens because the simple methods, e.g., k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and mean/mode imputation, fail in most cases to incorporate the complex relationships that define these medical datasets. To address these limitations, in this paper we test and improve state-of-the-art missing data imputation models and practices. We propose a new missing value imputation method based on denoising autoencoders (DAE) with kNN for the pre-imputation task. We optimize the training methodology by re-applying kNN to the missing data every $N$ epochs using a different value for the variable $k$ each time to yield more accurate results. We also revise a state-of-the-art missing data imputation approach based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). Using this as a baseline, we introduce improvements regarding both the architecture and the training procedure. These models are compared with the ones usually employed within clinical research studies for both the task of imputation and post-imputation prediction. Results show that our proposed deep learning approaches outperform the standard baselines, yielding better imputation and predictive results.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Effective Heart Disease Prediction Using Hybrid Machine Learning Techniques', 'abstract': 'Heart disease is one of the most significant causes of mortality in the world today. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is a critical challenge in the area of clinical data analysis. Machine learning (ML) has been shown to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare industry. We have also seen ML techniques being used in recent developments in different areas of the Internet of Things (IoT). Various studies give only a glimpse into predicting heart disease with ML techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel method that aims at finding significant features by applying machine learning techniques resulting in improving the accuracy in the prediction of cardiovascular disease. The prediction model is introduced with different combinations of features and several known classification techniques. We produce an enhanced performance level with an accuracy level of 88.7% through the prediction model for heart disease with the hybrid random forest with a linear model (HRFLM).'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Learning IoT in Edge: Deep Learning for the Internet of Things with Edge Computing', 'abstract': 'Deep learning is a promising approach for extracting accurate information from raw sensor data from IoT devices deployed in complex environments. Because of its multilayer structure, deep learning is also appropriate for the edge computing environment. Therefore, in this article, we first introduce deep learning for IoTs into the edge computing environment. Since existing edge nodes have limited processing capability, we also design a novel offloading strategy to optimize the performance of IoT deep learning applications with edge computing. In the performance evaluation, we test the performance of executing multiple deep learning tasks in an edge computing environment with our strategy. The evaluation results show that our method outperforms other optimization solutions on deep learning for IoT.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Identification of significant features and data mining techniques in predicting heart disease', 'abstract': 'Cardiovascular disease is one of the biggest cause for morbidity and mortality among the population of the world. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subject in the section of clinical data analysis. The amount of data in the healthcare industry is huge. Data mining turns the large collection of raw healthcare data into information that can help to make informed decision and prediction. There are some existing studies that applied data mining techniques in heart disease prediction. Nonetheless, studies that have given attention towards the significant features that play a vital role in predicting cardiovascular disease are limited. It is crucial to select the correct combination of significant features that can improve the performance of the prediction models. This research aims to identify significant features and data mining techniques that can improve the accuracy of predicting cardiovascular disease. Prediction models were developed using different combination of features, and seven classification techniques: k-NN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network and Vote (a hybrid technique with Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression). Experiment results show that the heart disease prediction model developed using the identified significant features and the best-performing data mining technique (i.e. Vote) achieves an accuracy of 87.4% in heart disease prediction.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Coronary Artery Heart Disease Prediction: A Comparative Study of Computational Intelligence Techniques', 'abstract': 'Diseases is an unusual circumstance that affects single or more parts of a human’s body.

Among all those diseases, heart disease turns out to be the most common disease and the impact of this ailment is dangerous than all other diseases. In this paper, we compared a number of computational intelligence techniques for the prediction of coronary artery heart disease. Seven computational intelligence techniques named as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) were applied and a comparative study was drawn.

Illness diagnosis plays a critical role in designating treatment strategies, which are highly related to patient safety. Nowadays, numerous classification models in data mining domains are adapted to breast cancer diagnosis based on patients’ historical medical records. However, the performance of each algorithm depends on various model configurations, such as input feature types and model parameters. To tackle the limitation of individual model performance, this research focuses on breast cancer diagnosis that uses an SVM-based ensemble learning algorithm to reduce the diagnosis variance and increase diagnosis accuracy. Twelve different SVMs, based on the proposed Weighted Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Ensemble (WAUCE) approach, are hybridized. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, Wisconsin Breast Cancer, Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer, and the U.S. National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program breast cancer datasets have been studied. The experimental results show that the WAUCE model achieves a higher accuracy with a significantly lower variance for breast cancer diagnosis compared to five other ensemble mechanisms and two common ensemble models, i.e., adaptive boosting and bagging classification tree. The proposed WAUCE model reduces the variance by 97.89% and increases accuracy by 33.34%, compared to the best single SVM model on the SEER dataset. In practice, the proposed methodology can be further applied to other illness diagnoses, which offers an alternative to a safer, more reliable, and more robust illness diagnosis process.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Federated-Learning-Empowered Semi-Supervised Active Learning Framework for Intrusion Detection in ZSM', 'abstract': \"Exponential growth of novel radical applications and services in sixth-generation (6G) networks is expected to increase the complexity of managing existing network infrastructures. In this context, the zero touch network and service management (ZSM) paradigm, which leverages AI, SDN, and NFV techniques, is seen as a promising solution to automatically manage and orchestrate network resources. However, due to the closed-loop operation and automated end-to-end framework in a distributed 6G network, the ZSM architecture, along with its potential benefits, is exposed to various security threats. A recently proposed solution to address privacy concerns is federated learning (FL), whereby distributed training is performed, and the aggregated model parameters, instead of clients' raw data, are forwarded to the global server. However, most of the existing FL and semi-supervised learning (SSL) models for intrusion detection are based on the assumption that fully labeled data are always available at the server and client sides, which is not practical due to the high labeling costs and privacy constraints in the 6G network. In this article, we propose a novel FL-empowered semi-supervised active learning (FL-SSAL) security orchestration framework for the Label-at-Client scenario where, along with unlabeled samples, clients have a small portion of labeled data. The entropy-based active learning selects the most informative samples for data annotation and leverages the unlabeled data using a semi-supervised approach. The results of our experimental evaluations performed on the private, not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) dataset demonstrate that FL-SSAL achieves higher intrusion detection accuracy and has less communication overhead than baseline schemes with less labeled data.\"}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'The Roadmap to 6G: AI Empowered Wireless Networks', 'abstract': 'The recent upsurge of diversified mobile applications, especially those supported by AI, is spurring heated discussions on the future evolution of wireless communications.

There is a pronounced focus on semi-supervised learning methods combined with active learning strategies, often deployed in distributed and resource-constrained environments like edge computing. The dominant methodology employs embedding representations learned via deep architectures to extract salient features that effectively summarize complex inputs, which supports downstream tasks such as intrusion detection, disease prediction, and anomaly detection. Federated learning and semi-supervised active learning emerge as key paradigms to address data privacy, labeling scarcity, and heterogeneity, reflecting a response to limitations of purely supervised and centralized models. Key thematic clusters demonstrate a synergy between embedding-based models for health records and cyber-physical systems security, unified by shared challenges in managing labeled data scarcity and computational constraints at the edge.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps include a persistent under-exploration of embedding space interpretability and quantitative evaluation of representational quality that are crucial for trustworthy deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and security. Despite advances in federated and semi-supervised approaches, handling heterogeneous, non-IID data distributions without compromising model fidelity remains insufficiently addressed. There is also limited integration between deep generative models (e.g., denoising autoencoders) and federated semi-supervised learning to robustly characterize embedding spaces. Furthermore, cross-domain adaptive representation learning leveraging domain shifts is largely unexplored. Externally, from the global perspective, the synergy between intrusion detection and deep neural network embeddings identifies an opportunity overlooked by current research: combining embedding quality analysis with real-time anomaly detection in distributed networks. Another novel gap is the underutilization of attention mechanisms and masked autoencoders (recent advances in deep learning) for embedding quality evaluation within constrained edge environments. Additionally, the potential of linking denoising autoencoders with interpretability frameworks and probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty in learned embeddings remains untapped.",
