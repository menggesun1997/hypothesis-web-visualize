More recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made rapid advancements that have propelled AI to a new level, enabling and empowering even more diverse applications and industrial domains with intelligence, particularly in areas like software engineering and natural language processing. Nevertheless, a number of emerging trustworthiness concerns and issues exhibited in LLMs, e.g., robustness and hallucination, have already recently received much attention, without properly solving which the widespread adoption of LLMs could be greatly hindered in practice. The distinctive characteristics of LLMs, such as the self-attention mechanism, extremely large neural network scale, and autoregressive generation usage contexts, differ from classic AI software based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks and present new challenges for quality analysis. Up to the present, it still lacks universal and systematic analysis techniques for LLMs despite the urgent industrial demand across diverse domains. Towards bridging such a gap, in this paper, we initiate an early exploratory study and propose a universal analysis framework for LLMs, named LUNA, which is designed to be general and extensible and enables versatile analysis of LLMs from multiple quality perspectives in a human-interpretable manner. In particular, we first leverage the data from desired trustworthiness perspectives to construct an abstract model as an auxiliary analysis asset and proxy, which is empowered by various abstract model construction methods built-in LUNA. To assess the quality of the abstract model, we collect and define a number of evaluation metrics, aiming at both the abstract model level and the semantics level. Then, the semantics, which is the degree of satisfaction of the LLM w.r.t. the trustworthiness perspective, is bound to and enriches the abstract model with semantics, which enables more detailed analysis applications for diverse purposes, e.g., abnormal behavior detection. To better understand the potential usefulness of our analysis framework LUNA, we conduct a large-scale evaluation, the results of which demonstrate that 1) the abstract model has the potential to distinguish normal and abnormal behavior in LLM, 2) LUNA is effective for the real-world analysis of LLMs in practice, and the hyperparameter settings influence the performance, 3) different evaluation metrics are in different correlations with the analysis performance. In order to encourage further studies in the quality assurance of LLMs, we made all of the code and more detailed experimental results data available on the supplementary website of this paper https://sites.google.com/view/llm-luna.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Summary of ChatGPT-Related research and perspective towards the future of large language models', 'abstract': \"This paper presents a comprehensive survey of ChatGPT-related (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) research, state-of-the-art large language models (LLM) from the GPT series, and their prospective applications across diverse domains.

We used Likert scale analysis and inductive free-text categorization to assess the quality of the simplified reports.ResultsMost radiologists agreed that the simplified reports were factually correct, complete, and not potentially harmful to the patient. Nevertheless, instances of incorrect statements, missed relevant medical information, and potentially harmful passages were reported.ConclusionWhile we see a need for further adaption to the medical field, the initial insights of this study indicate a tremendous potential in using LLMs like ChatGPT to improve patient-centered care in radiology and other medical domains.Clinical relevance statementPatients have started to use ChatGPT to simplify and explain their medical reports, which is expected to affect patient-doctor interaction. This phenomenon raises several opportunities and challenges for clinical routine.Key Points• Patients have started to use ChatGPT to simplify their medical reports, but their quality was unknown.• In a questionnaire, most participating radiologists overall asserted good quality to radiology reports simplified with ChatGPT. However, they also highlighted a notable presence of errors, potentially leading patients to draw harmful conclusions.• Large language models such as ChatGPT have vast potential to enhance patient-centered care in radiology and other medical domains. To realize this potential while minimizing harm, they need supervision by medical experts and adaption to the medical field.Graphical Abstract'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'BioBERT: a pre-trained biomedical language representation model for biomedical text mining', 'abstract': 'MOTIVATION: Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important as the number of biomedical documents rapidly grows. With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora.\\nRESULTS: We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24% MRR improvement). Our analysis results show that pre-training BERT on biomedical corpora helps it to understand complex biomedical texts.\\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We make the pre-trained weights of BioBERT freely available at https://github.com/naver/biobert-pretrained, and the source code for fine-tuning BioBERT available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots', 'abstract': 'The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English.

Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'The Role of AI in Drug Discovery: Challenges, Opportunities, and Strategies', 'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the drug discovery process, offering improved efficiency, accuracy, and speed.

By conducting a human evaluation on ten LLMs across different pretraining methods, prompts, and model scales, we make two important observations. First, we find instruction tuning, not model size, is the key to the LLM’s zero-shot summarization capability. Second, existing studies have been limited by low-quality references, leading to underestimates of human performance and lower few-shot and finetuning performance. To better evaluate LLMs, we perform human evaluation over high-quality summaries we collect from freelance writers.

    "current_research_landscape": "The current research in intrinsic evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is centered on developing model-based, systematic, and versatile frameworks such as LUNA to analyze multiple quality dimensions of LLMs, including trustworthiness attributes like robustness and hallucination. This evolution responds directly to earlier limitations evident in ad hoc or task-specific evaluations; researchers have shifted towards holistic evaluation approaches (HELM) and benchmark standardization to assess LLM capabilities comprehensively across scenarios and metrics. The core methodologies leverage abstract modeling of neural networks combined with semantic enrichment and diverse quality metrics, focusing primarily on natural language processing and biomedical text mining applications. Clusters of concepts emphasize language representation models tailored for domain-specific corpora (e.g., BioBERT for biomedical text), and reinforcement learning methods. There is a clear consensus on the importance of both foundational pretraining and fine-tuning (including RLHF) coupled with robust evaluation protocols to better capture model behavior beyond mere size or superficial metrics. These advances reflect a maturation from isolated performance benchmarks to multifaceted, interpretable, and extensible frameworks that unify evaluation perspectives across applications.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internally, recent work reveals persistent gaps including the limited handling of domain-specific complexities in intrinsic metrics—e.g., the biomedical simplification study reports occasional factual inaccuracies despite overall promising performance. There is a notable under-exploration of trustworthy metric calibration—how intrinsic evaluations relate quantitatively to real-world harms or downstream errors remains partly ambiguous. The evolutionary graph also shows scant focus on connecting abstract model analysis techniques directly to ethical and legal frameworks governing AI deployment, particularly in sensitive fields like healthcare. Externally, the global context identifies overlooked cross-disciplinary bridges such as integrating word-cloud and visual question answering representations with neural language models' intrinsic evaluation; this suggests potential for more nuanced, multi-modal assessment strategies. Furthermore, the relationship between language representation models and emerging anomaly detection techniques in dynamic, cloud-based environments is untapped, offering routes to evaluate model consistency and perplexity under real-time usage conditions. These gaps underscore insufficient synergy between intrinsic model diagnostics and pragmatic interpretability, ethical transparency, and multi-modality.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "1. Develop Multi-Modal Intrinsic Evaluation Frameworks: By bridging 'language representation models' with 'word-cloud representations' and visual question answering concepts, researchers can create richer, context-aware intrinsic metrics that assess not only textual perplexity and consistency but also semantic and visual alignment, enhancing robustness and interpretability in complex domains like biomedical text mining.\n\n2. Real-Time Anomaly Detection in LLM Behavior: Leveraging the co-concepts of anomaly detection and cloud environments from the GPS analysis, new directions involve embedding intrinsic evaluation metrics within dynamic system monitoring frameworks to detect hallucinations or trustworthiness deterioration in LLMs deployed at scale, enabling proactive adaptation and error mitigation.\n\n3. Integrate Ethical and Legal Oversight into Intrinsic Evaluation Metrics: Addressing the internal gap related to ethical and legal considerations, research should innovate on evaluation paradigms that quantify not only model accuracy but also fairness, privacy compliance, and accountability dimensions, guided by transparent and auditable intrinsic measures aligned with healthcare and sensitive domain regulatory requirements."
