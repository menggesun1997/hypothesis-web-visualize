        "title": "Efficient Privacy-Preserving Intrinsic Benchmarking via Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption and Federated Learning for Healthcare LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Sensitive healthcare data restrict collaborative and open intrinsic evaluation of large language models (LLMs), hindering community-wide development of trustworthy models due to privacy, regulatory, and interoperability challenges.",
        "Motivation": "Current intrinsic benchmarking techniques require access to raw clinical data or decrypted embeddings, posing privacy risks. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) can enable computations on encrypted data, its application to complex intrinsic probing of LLMs remains underexplored and computationally challenging. This proposal innovatively combines state-of-the-art leveled homomorphic encryption schemes with federated learning architectures, empowering privacy-preserving intrinsic benchmarking that simultaneously ensures interpretability and scalability across distributed healthcare institutions. By integrating advanced cryptographic protocols and federated system designs, this work addresses prior novelty concerns and defines a feasible, transparent, and secure evaluation framework aligned with data protection regulations such as GDPR.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid privacy framework blending leveled homomorphic encryption (LHE) optimized for approximate linear algebra computations with a federated learning (FL) system to enable scalable, privacy-preserving intrinsic benchmarking of healthcare LLMs. The method entails: (1) locally generating clinical LLM embeddings on each institution's data; (2) encrypting these embeddings via an optimized LHE scheme supporting approximate inner products and polynomial evaluations to enable intrinsic probing operations; (3) executing intrinsic probing algorithms (e.g., linear probes for syntactic and semantic features) directly on encrypted embeddings via homomorphic evaluation, carefully adapted to the supported operations and noise constraints of LHE, thereby preserving interpretability signals; (4) aggregating encrypted intrinsic probe outcomes across institutions in the FL framework without raw data or decrypted embeddings exchange; and (5) employing advanced compression and noise management techniques to mitigate computational overhead. Our method incorporates cryptographic protocols proven efficient for complex approximate computations and designs intrinsic probing tasks aligned with LHE-supported operations to maintain accuracy. Additionally, a robust malicious node detection mechanism within the federated system ensures trustworthy benchmarking results and prevents adversarial poisoning or privacy leakage.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Preparation: Select multiple heterogeneous, de-identified clinical text datasets from collaborating institutions, covering diverse specialties to evaluate scalability and generalizability. 2) Baseline Intrinsic Probing: Execute plaintext intrinsic probing tasks on LLM embeddings to establish accuracy and interpretability benchmarks. 3) Encryption Parameter Tuning: Configure LHE parameters for optimized precision-latency tradeoffs validated via theoretical noise growth and empirical tests. 4) Intrinsic Probing Adaptation: Reformulate probe computations (e.g., logistic regression probes) to polynomial approximations compatible with LHE capabilities. 5) Federated Setup: Deploy a federated learning architecture enabling secure enrollment of participant nodes and encrypted result aggregation with malicious node detection. 6) Performance Evaluation: Measure probe accuracy on encrypted embeddings versus plaintext baselines, computational overhead (runtime, memory), end-to-end latency, and scalability over increasing dataset size and number of institutions. 7) Privacy Leakage Quantification: Apply differential privacy metrics and cryptanalysis to evaluate information leakage risk from encrypted probing outcomes. 8) Decision Criteria and Fallback Plan: Define quantitative thresholds (e.g., maximum 2x overhead over plaintext runtime, probe accuracy drop <5%) to trigger fallback strategies. Document fallback evaluation deploying hybrid secure multiparty computation or trusted execution environments to balance privacy and efficiency if necessary.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical narrative embeddings generated locally at Hospital A encrypted via leveled homomorphic encryption; Expected Output: Encrypted intrinsic probe outputs (e.g., syntactic feature prediction accuracy) aggregated with outputs from Hospital B and Hospital C in a federated system, enabling a transparent, privacy-preserving benchmarking report showing comparable semantic understanding metrics to plaintext evaluations without exposing any raw patient data or decrypted embeddings.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Establish empirical performance thresholdsâ€”if end-to-end encrypted probing exceeds two times the plaintext latency or prediction accuracy degrades beyond 5%, transition to a fallback hybrid approach utilizing secure multiparty computation (SMC) combined with trusted execution environments (TEE). This fallback will process probe computations through smaller protected enclaves reducing homomorphic evaluation overhead while maintaining strict privacy guarantees. Additionally, explore model distillation to simpler probe architectures compatible with less computationally intensive cryptographic methods. This dual fallback offers a controlled tradeoff ensuring feasibility without forfeiting fundamental privacy or interpretability aims."

It is unclear how model interpretability or probing signals can be preserved or extracted without decryption, considering existing homomorphic encryption schemes incur constraints on supported operations and noise accumulation. Clarify the mechanism by which intrinsic benchmarks are computed, the choice of homomorphic encryption schemes, and how data representations and probes adapt to enable transparent and unbiased evaluation without sacrificing interpretability or accuracy of the intrinsic measurements. This will strengthen the soundness of the core approach substantially and address fundamental cryptographic feasibility concerns inherent in the method, which currently appear underspecified and speculative in the description provided, particularly given the computational complexity of such operations on LLM representations in healthcare contexts. Consider referencing or adapting advanced cryptographic protocols known for efficiency or approximate computations to bridge this gap convincingly in the proposal detail section (Proposed_Method)."

There is also no concrete plan to measure scalability across multiple institutions or diverse clinical datasets, which is critical for demonstrating real-world applicability. Additional details are needed on dataset selection criteria, encryption parameter settings, intrinsic probe design adaptations, and privacy leakage quantification methods. Also, the fallback plan is a positive inclusion but would benefit from clearer decision criteria or triggers based on empirical performance thresholds (e.g., maximum acceptable encryption overhead or latency). Without these, the experimental validation risks being inconclusive or non-representative of deployment scenarios. Enhance the experimental design with explicit benchmarks, dataset variety, and an end-to-end evaluation strategy that factors in both privacy guarantees and real healthcare practitioner needs to ensure practical feasibility is rigorously tested."
