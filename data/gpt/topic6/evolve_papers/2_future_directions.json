        "Problem_Statement": "Current embedding space evaluations lack interpretability and robustness in distributed, privacy-sensitive settings such as healthcare IoT systems. There is a need for frameworks that can quantitatively assess embedding quality while preserving privacy and handling heterogeneous data.",
        "Motivation": "This project directly addresses the internal critical gap of embedding space interpretability combined with privacy concerns and heterogeneity in federated learning environments. It extends the high-potential opportunity to develop generative embedding quality metrics utilizing denoising autoencoders (DAEs) and GANs within semi-supervised federated frameworks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel federated semi-supervised active learning framework that integrates generative modeling for embedding space quality evaluation. Each client node trains local DAEs and GANs on partial labeled and unlabeled data to model embedding distributions. Embedding quality is quantified via reconstruction error and generative adversarial loss complemented with metrics capturing feature diversity and disentanglement. Federated aggregation of these metrics yields a global interpretable embedding quality score. Active learning selects samples that improve generative model fidelity and embedding robustness. The architecture enforces privacy via secure aggregation and differential privacy mechanisms.",

        "Fallback_Plan": "If GAN-based embedding metrics prove unstable, substitute with Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based uncertainty estimation and use contrastive learning to enhance embedding separability. Alternatively, incorporate simpler federated clustering metrics to approximate quality."
