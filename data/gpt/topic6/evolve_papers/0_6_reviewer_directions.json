    "Problem_Statement": "Existing intrinsic probes for healthcare LLMs lack adaptability to new clinical subdomains with varying linguistic expressions and data scarcity, reducing robustness of benchmarking.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by adaptive human activity recognition embedding techniques, this project develops adaptive intrinsic probes embedding clinical language understanding patterns dynamically, addressing internal weaknesses in training efficiency and external cross-domain applicability gaps.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create intrinsic probes that learn embeddings of human clinical activity concepts from few-shot samples and dynamically adapt to new specialties or practices by fine-tuning embedding manifolds, enabling flexible intrinsic benchmarking with minimal data.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets from diverse clinical specialties. 2) Learn initial intrinsic probe embeddings on core specialties. 3) Fine-tune probes with few-shot data on new domains. 4) Evaluate probe robustness and adaptability. 5) Compare to fixed intrinsic probes.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Few clinical notes from rare specialty; Expected Output: Adaptive intrinsic probe maintains high comprehension fidelity and bias detection despite domain shift.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptation is insufficient, supplement probes with external knowledge bases or introduce meta-learning frameworks for rapid intrinsic probe generalization."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-MECHANISM",
          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks clarity on how embeddings of 'human clinical activity concepts' will be constructed and adapted. The mechanism by which few-shot fine-tuning adjusts embedding manifolds to maintain intrinsic probe fidelity and bias detection across domains requires elaboration. Specifically, detail the mathematical formulation or learning architecture enabling dynamic adaptation, and how it differs from or improves upon current adaptive probing techniques, to strengthen the methodological soundness of this approach and convince reviewers of its novelty and efficacy in variable clinical contexts. Without this, the premise risks being perceived as overly speculative or incremental despite promising motivation and goals, limiting the confidence in soundness of the method itself. Consider including a concrete model design or algorithm pseudocode in the proposal for clarity and rigor in this critical component of the approach, thereby enhancing review quality and feasibility assessment accuracy at subsequent stages. Targeting the embedding adaptation mechanism will thus reinforce the core contribution claim and early feasibility assumptions simultaneously. The proposal’s impact depends strongly on this mechanism’s validity and distinctiveness from existing approaches; explaining this clearly will help justify its potential impact and novelty in a competitive field, beyond an incremental composition of known techniques, which is indicated as a challenge from the preliminary novelty assessment results. This makes it a foundational improvement area if the project is to succeed convincingly and make a meaningful field contribution beyond the state-of-the-art intrinsic probes for healthcare LLMs under domain shifts and data scarcity conditions identified in the Problem_Statement and Motivation sections. Revisiting and explicitly outlining this part accordingly is essential before progressing further evaluations or resource commitments for the project, to avoid downstream risks and to foster external stakeholder confidence in method innovation and expected impact gains. Thus, addressing this critique must take precedence to solidify the project’s scientific rigor and distinctiveness early on in the research plan development cycle, simultaneously clarifying and justifying the method's novelty and applicability scope claims in the context of existing literature and technical approaches, which will also assist refining objectives and evaluation criteria downstream in the Experiment_Plan and Deliverables sections for overall coherence and impact optimization of the final research outputs and publications arising from the project."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty assessment indicates a competitive area, integrating insights from 'multi-view fusion' could substantively enhance the proposal's impact and novelty. Specifically, consider leveraging multi-view fusion models to combine heterogeneous clinical language embeddings with orthogonal data modalities — for example, patient activity data or sensor-derived human activity pattern embeddings — to create richer, more robust intrinsic probes that capture latent cross-domain interactions more effectively. This would extend the current approach beyond unimodal language embeddings and could address domain shift issues more comprehensively by correlating multi-view signals reflecting clinical realities. Moreover, using multi-view fusion can improve adaptation efficiency and resilience across diverse specialties by harmonizing complementary information sources, a strategy well-aligned with the proposal’s dynamic adaptation aims. This integration could also open unique research contributions leveraging network biology concepts for structured embedding regularization, or nutritional science domain ontologies from the International Union of Nutritional Sciences for specialized biomedical semantic enrichment, further differentiating the proposed probes and expanding potential application impact areas. Such a multidisciplinary fusion approach can elevate the project’s competitiveness, deepening both theoretical novelty and practical utility of intrinsic probes in healthcare LLM benchmarking, potentially attracting broader interdisciplinary interest and higher impact publication venues."
