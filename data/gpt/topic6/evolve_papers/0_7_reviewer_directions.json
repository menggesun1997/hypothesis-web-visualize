    "title": "Joint Video-Language Intrinsic Benchmarking for Real-Time Clinical Decision Support LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM evaluation in real-time clinical workflows ignores the temporal-video modality critical for understanding patient dynamics, resulting in incomplete intrinsic benchmarks.",
    "Motivation": "Leverages the hidden bridge between joint video understanding and healthcare system efficiency to design synchronized video-language intrinsic probes capturing temporal, contextual cues for LLMs, addressing external multimodal and workflow integration gaps.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct temporal alignment intrinsic probes using clinical video streams (e.g., endoscopy, surgery) synchronized with real-time medical notes, assessing LLM comprehension of evolving patient states and procedural contexts intrinsically within a multi-task probing framework.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Acquire annotated procedure videos with timestamped clinical text. 2) Build intrinsic probes scoring temporal semantic alignment and context retention. 3) Evaluate LLMs fine-tuned for clinical decision support tasks. 4) Compare to static text-only intrinsic probes. 5) Metrics: temporal alignment score, language understanding retention, clinical relevance measures.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Video of a surgical step with surgeon notes; Expected Output: Intrinsic probe confirms LLM's understanding of procedural progression and correlating clinical language.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If video synchronization is challenging, decouple modalities and develop approximate temporal matching proxies or concentrate on procedural step classification intrinsic probes."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines building temporal alignment intrinsic probes to assess LLM comprehension of evolving patient states from synchronized clinical videos and text. However, the mechanism by which these probes quantitatively measure 'comprehension' and 'context retention' intrinsic to LLMs is not sufficiently detailed. It is unclear how intrinsic probing will differentiate between mere pattern matching and genuine temporal understanding or how multi-task probing frameworks will be architected to handle complex clinical semantics alongside video dynamics. Providing a clearer model design or algorithmic framework for probe construction and evaluation is essential for soundness and reproducibility. Clarification on the specific metrics and their interpretability vis-à-vis LLM reasoning would strengthen this section significantly. This will help ensure the method is not only conceptually appealing but technically rigorous and well-founded in methodology literature, particularly given the known challenges in video-language alignment within clinical domains."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while comprehensive, hinges critically on acquiring richly annotated procedure videos with synchronous timestamped clinical text—a resource that may be scarce, protected by privacy regulations, or vary widely in quality and standardization. The plan should address the feasibility challenges regarding data procurement channels, annotation consistency, and the synchronization pipeline implementation. Furthermore, defining fallback strategies appears reactive; a more proactive, scalable approach to handle incomplete or noisy synchronization data (e.g., semi-supervised or weakly supervised methods) would strengthen the experimental robustness. Detailing concrete criteria for dataset selection, initial pilot studies to validate probe feasibility, and contingency plans for scaling beyond limited datasets would improve experimental planning soundness."
