    "title": "BioRisk-LLM: Infusing Dose-Response Modelling into Behavioral Consistency Metrics for LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a significant lack of intrinsic evaluation frameworks that integrate biological dose-response principles to assess LLM behavior and robustness. Current models fail to provide interpretable, quantitative thresholds of behavioral deviation akin to toxicological benchmarks, limiting understanding of model risk under adversarial or noisy input.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the critical gap of missing cross-disciplinary evaluation by synthesizing dose-response toxicological modeling with LLM behavioral consistency metrics. This novel approach leverages 'hidden bridge' insights to introduce risk thresholding concepts to AI evaluation, fulfilling the call for robust, interpretable testing paradigms.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop BioRisk-LLM, a behavioral evaluation framework that treats input perturbations as 'dose' increments and measures model response deviations as 'toxicity' analogs. Establish a dose-response curve for LLM output consistency using controlled perturbations ranging from benign to adversarial noise. Define behavioral tolerance thresholds analogous to TDI values, enabling risk categorization of model responses. Integrate statistical dose-response models (e.g., benchmark dose modeling) to fit behavioral data and estimate benchmark behavioral deviation doses (BBDDs).",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select representative LLMs (e.g., GPT-3, PaLM).\n2. Design perturbation schemes (syntactic noise, semantic paraphrases, adversarial examples) with quantifiable intensities.\n3. Collect response outputs and define behavioral deviation metrics (e.g., semantic similarity drop, consistency score).\n4. Fit dose-response models to quantify behavioral risk thresholds.\n5. Evaluate framework robustness across datasets (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE).\n6. Compare against baseline intrinsic evaluation metrics without dose-response integration.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Original question \"What is the capital of France?\" (dose=0)\nPerturbation: Paraphrase with spelling mistakes increasing noise dose\nOutput: Consistent answer \"Paris\" at low doses, deviation or errors at high doses\nExpected: Dose-response curve showing increasing behavioral inconsistency beyond a benchmark dose~0.3 noise intensity.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If dose-response curve fitting is unstable, explore non-parametric smoothing techniques or quantile regression for estimating behavioral thresholds. Alternatively, employ Bayesian hierarchical modeling to capture uncertainty in behavioral risk estimation."

        "title": "BioRisk-LLM 2.0: A Theoretically Grounded Dose-Response Framework Integrating Human-Computer Interaction Metrics for Robust LLM Behavioral Consistency Evaluation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing intrinsic evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) inadequately quantify behavioral risk under input perturbations in an interpretable, standardized manner. While biological dose-response modeling offers a conceptual analogy, fundamental differences between chemical toxicity affecting physiological systems and semantic variations in LLM outputs—often subjective and context-dependent—challenge the direct transposition of such principles. This creates a gap in establishing sound, mechanistic evaluation methods that rigorously define and quantify thresholds of behavioral deviation under increasing perturbation intensities, accounting for model stochasticity and semantic complexity. Addressing this gap requires a robust theoretical framework that reconciles dose-response modeling with semantic behavioral metrics and integrates human-computer interaction standards to enable reproducible, meaningful risk threshold assessments.",
        "Motivation": "To transcend metaphorical analogies and establish a scientifically rigorous, multidisciplinary evaluation framework that merges dose-response modeling with quantified semantic behavioral deviation metrics informed by human-computer interaction (HCI) principles. This approach uniquely frames perturbation intensity as a calibrated 'dose' and behavioral inconsistency as a risk phenotype, enabling interpretable risk thresholding aligned with real-world user experience variability and communication challenges. With the surge of AI applications in critical domains like healthcare innovation and intelligent computing, robust, standardized intrinsic evaluation techniques are imperative for AI trustworthiness and deployment decisions. By addressing foundational conceptual gaps and ensuring comparability across perturbation types and behavioral metrics through rigorous calibration and statistical validation, this work offers a novel, practically impactful contribution to AI evaluation research beyond prior exploratory or metaphorical studies.",
        "Proposed_Method": "1. Develop a formal theoretical framework establishing conditions under which biological dose-response models can be adapted to LLM behavioral evaluation by characterizing perturbation intensity as a quantifiable dose using metrics aligned with perturbation semantic impact and HCI-driven user communication disruption models. 2. Define a multi-dimensional dose metric framework: syntactic dose measured by normalized edit distance and syntactic error rate; semantic dose by embedding space distance metrics calibrated against human similarity judgments; adversarial dose by perturbation strength measured via established adversarial attack norms. 3. Establish behavioral deviation metrics integrating semantic similarity drops, response consistency scores, and user-centered communication effectiveness metrics derived from HCI interaction protocols. 4. Implement statistical dose-response modeling pipelines, employing parametric benchmark dose modeling, non-parametric smoothing, and Bayesian hierarchical models to robustly estimate benchmark behavioral deviation doses (BBDDs) with uncertainty quantification. 5. Integrate multiple runs, variance analysis, and noise calibration protocols to control for model stochasticity and response variability, ensuring reproducibility. 6. Link the framework with big data-driven calibration datasets spanning GLUE, SuperGLUE benchmarks and real-world human-computer interaction logs to validate risk threshold interpretations in applied contexts such as intelligent healthcare communication and AI-assisted decision support.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select a diverse representative set of LLMs (e.g., GPT-3 variants, PaLM, and open-source alternatives) to cover a spectrum of architectures and capabilities. 2. Catalog and implement perturbation schemes across syntactic (e.g., controlled typo injection), semantic (e.g., paraphrasing calibrated by human judgment scores), and adversarial (e.g., established adversarial attack techniques with controllable strength) categories. 3. Define and standardize dose intensity measures per perturbation type, including normalization and scaling protocols to ensure cross-type comparability. 4. Design behavioral deviation metrics combining semantic similarity (e.g., cosine similarity of embeddings), response consistency (e.g., agreement over paraphrases), and HCI-derived communication effectiveness proxies (e.g., human evaluation of output interpretability and user comprehension). 5. Conduct repeated evaluations across multiple runs to capture response variability; implement variance decomposition and noise calibration to quantify stochasticity impact. 6. Fit dose-response models (parametric and non-parametric) to experimental data, compute BBDDs with confidence intervals, and perform sensitivity analyses. 7. Validate model robustness and generalizability on established benchmarks (GLUE, SuperGLUE) and in simulated human-computer interaction scenarios reflecting real-world application contexts, emphasizing intelligent healthcare innovation communication scenarios. 8. Compare results against baseline intrinsic evaluation methods lacking dose-response formalism to demonstrate improved interpretability and risk assessment precision.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Query 'What is the capital of France?' (dose=0; pristine input)\nPerturbations and dose calibrations:\n- Syntactic dose: Inject controlled spelling mistakes increasing edit distance increments from 0 to 0.4 (normalized scale).\n- Semantic dose: Replace tokens with paraphrases evaluated through embedding cosine distance calibrated against human-annotated paraphrase similarity scores, scaled 0 to 1.\n- Adversarial dose: Apply adversarial perturbations with increasing confidence scores indicating strength, scaled 0 to 1.\nMeasured output:\n- Behavioral deviation metrics include semantic similarity drop relative to pristine output, response consistency across paraphrase variants, and human-rated communication clarity scores.\nExpected:\n- Dose-response curves quantitatively showing gradual behavioral inconsistency increase beyond benchmark doses (e.g., BBDD at dose ~0.3 for spelling error rate), validated statistically with uncertainty bands derived from repeated runs. These curves will enable classification of perturbation doses as within-tolerance or high-risk zones analogous to toxicological safe exposure thresholds, with implications for improving interaction robustness in intelligent computing and healthcare applications.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If parametric dose-response model fitting encounters instability or convergence issues due to semantic complexity or data sparsity, pivot to more flexible non-parametric smoothing techniques (e.g., LOESS, Gaussian Process regression) coupled with cross-validation to estimate risk thresholds. Incorporate quantile regression to characterize behavioral deviation distribution tails relevant for worst-case risk assessment. Should dose metric standardization prove challenging across perturbation types, develop hierarchical Bayesian models treating dose as latent variables inferred jointly with behavioral response, leveraging big data from diverse perturbation and interaction sources for robust parameter estimation. Furthermore, engage human-in-the-loop calibration by incorporating direct user feedback and communication effectiveness metrics from human-computer interaction studies to reinforce or recalibrate risk threshold estimates ensuring practical interpretability and relevance."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that biological dose-response principles can be meaningfully and directly transposed to language model behavioral evaluation. However, the fundamental nature of biological toxicity and LLM output perturbations differ substantially—biological dose responses typically relate to physical/chemical exposures with well-defined physiological effects, whereas LLM perturbations affect complex semantic outputs with varied subjective interpretation. The proposal should provide a more rigorous justification or theoretical framework establishing that dose-response models are suitable and valid for quantifying LLM behavioral consistency and risk thresholds, addressing possible conceptual gaps or misalignments between bio-toxicological phenomena and AI output behaviors to ensure soundness of the core assumption. Without this strengthening, the foundational premise risks being overly simplistic or metaphorical rather than mechanistically solid, potentially undermining validity of subsequent model fitting and risk threshold estimation steps in the proposed method and experiments. This is critical to resolve upfront before implementation steps proceed to avoid misdirected analyses or inconclusive/incoherent results due to foundational mismatch of concepts and domains involved in the analogy used for the new evaluation framework (Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections)."

          "feedback_content": "While the experiment plan outlines a thoughtful sequence of steps and controls, it lacks concrete details on defining and quantifying the perturbation 'doses' especially across diverse perturbation types (syntactic noise, semantic paraphrases, adversarial examples). Clearly specifying how 'dose' intensity metrics are computed, standardized, and validated for comparability across perturbation schemes is necessary for reproducibility and meaningful dose-response curve fitting. Additionally, the plan should address potential confounding factors such as model stochasticity, response variance, and noise calibration, and incorporate multiple runs or statistical validation to ensure robustness. Moreover, the plan lacks clarity on the criteria for behavioral deviation metrics choice and how these will be correlated or fused with dose levels for fitting benchmark dose models. Including detailed methodological protocols here and preparing for potential data sparsity or model fitting challenges will greatly enhance practical feasibility and reliability of results (Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section)."
