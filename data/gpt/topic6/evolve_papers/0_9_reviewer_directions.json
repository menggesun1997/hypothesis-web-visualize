    "title": "Knowledge-Grounded Intrinsic Probing Incorporating Medical Ontologies and Federated Privacy",
    "Problem_Statement": "Intrinsic benchmarks rarely incorporate structured medical knowledge, limiting their semantic depth and interpretability during evaluation of federated healthcare LLMs.",
    "Motivation": "Synthesizes gaps in bias handling, privacy, and semantic richness by embedding medical ontology constraints (e.g., SNOMED CT) into federated intrinsic probing frameworks, thus enhancing fairness, privacy, and semantic benchmarking jointly.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement intrinsic probes augmented with ontology-driven semantic constraints operating within federated learning contexts, aligning LLM outputs with canonical medical knowledge while protecting dataset privacy and capturing bias-relevant deviations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate ontology-linked clinical datasets distributed in federated clients. 2) Incorporate ontology reasoning modules into intrinsic probes. 3) Measure intrinsic semantic adherence and bias. 4) Compare to ontology-agnostic baselines. 5) Metrics: semantic consistency, fairness scores, privacy metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Federated client clinical notes; Expected Output: Intrinsic probe evaluates concept output congruence with ontology semantics, revealing semantic and bias deviations without data exposure.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If ontology integration is complex, fallback to lightweight knowledge graph embedding proxies and partial ontology constraints in intrinsic probing."

Clarify how ontological constraints will be operationalized to influence probe outputs, particularly within privacy-preserving federated settings, to strengthen methodological soundness and reproducibility prospects. Specify the reasoning techniques (e.g., symbolic logic reasoning, embedding-based constraints) and their tight coupling with intrinsic probing modules to convincingly justify the approach's validity and efficacy in capturing semantic adherence and bias detection without leaking private data. This will also help differentiate the method from existing ontology-informed probing approaches in competitive literature, addressing both assumption validation and mechanistic clarity concerns in 'Proposed_Method'.  \n\n\"Proposed_Method\" section should be expanded accordingly to detail this integration clearly and unambiguously, potentially including a conceptual diagram or pseudocode for the hybrid intrinsic probe architecture integrating ontological constraints under federated privacy."

          "feedback_content": "To substantially enhance both the novelty and impact of the research, consider integrating elements from 'trustworthy machine learning' and 'graph data management' within the federated intrinsic probing framework. For instance, embedding formal trustworthiness criteria such as robustness and explainability metrics alongside semantic consistency could provide a more holistic evaluation of federated healthcare LLMs. Additionally, exploiting graph-based knowledge management methods could enable more scalable and interpretable incorporation of comprehensive medical ontologies beyond SNOMED CT, potentially leveraging graph embeddings or graph neural networks tailored for ontology reasoning. This integration would position the work at the intersection of knowledge discovery, trustworthy AI, and advanced data management, boosting the work's broader relevance and competitive edge. Include these aspects either as enhancements to the experimental plan or as future directions to strategically deepen and scope the proposal's innovation frontier beyond the current narrowly defined probing task."
