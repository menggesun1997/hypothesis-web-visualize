        "title": "Real-Time Intrinsic Evaluation with Causal Anomaly Reasoning and Multi-Agent Adaptive Control for Cloud-Deployed LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in dynamic, cloud-based environments currently lack a sophisticated, real-time intrinsic evaluation framework that not only detects hallucinations or trustworthiness degradation but also explains anomaly causes and adapts model behavior autonomously. This deficiency limits users' ability to understand and trust LLM outputs in critical, latency-sensitive applications.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work focuses on coupling anomaly detection with intrinsic evaluation metrics, existing methods inadequately address real-time scalability, interpretability, and adaptive robustness required in cloud LLM serving. Addressing these gaps, this proposal advances a comprehensive, responsible AI system that integrates a continuous intrinsic evaluation pipeline with causal anomaly reasoning and a multi-agent model governance framework. This approach enhances transparency, trust, and resilience beyond conventional methods by enabling explainable anomaly alerts and intelligent switching among domain-adapted model instances within stringent latency constraints.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel, modular system architecture comprising three integrated components: 1) Real-Time Intrinsic Metric Pipeline: We implement highly optimized streaming computation of perplexity and self-consistency metrics using lightweight approximations and batching strategies tightly coupled with the serving inference pipeline to ensure sub-10ms metric extraction latency without degrading model response times.\n\n2) Causal Anomaly Reasoning Layer: Leveraging techniques from Responsible AI, a causal inference module analyzes intrinsic metric anomalies contextualized with input features, user interaction signals, and historical performance data. This module employs interpretable models (e.g., attention-based causal graphs) to generate human-understandable explanations for detected anomalies, revealing probable hallucination sources or trustworthiness lapses.\n\n3) Multi-Agent Adaptive Control Framework: We design a multi-agent system managing a diverse pool of LLM instances (including domain-specialized fine-tuned variants). Using intelligent decision-making algorithms, agents collectively vote or switch model serving dynamically in response to anomaly detections. This collaborative mechanism utilizes multi-modal corroboration (e.g., vision-language verification where applicable) to robustly confirm output reliability.\n\nTo maintain effectiveness under concept drift, anomaly detection and causal reasoning models are continuously updated via an online learning pipeline orchestrated using a message broker architecture ensuring fast model refresh without service disruption. Adaptive actions include query throttling, fallback to more conservative models, or user notifications. We provide detailed system flow diagrams and pseudo-codes illustrating streaming integration, anomaly signal extraction, causal reasoning steps, online model updating, and multi-agent voting protocols. This fine-grained mechanistic elaboration clarifies performance-resource trade-offs and enables replication and deployment in production cloud LLM infrastructures.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Deploy the proposed system on a cloud platform hosting multiple LLM instances, instrumented for low-latency intrinsic metric extraction.\n2) Construct diverse test query streams including natural, adversarial, and multi-modal inputs to challenge model reliability.\n3) Develop and benchmark the causal anomaly reasoning models for explanation quality and runtime overhead.\n4) Implement the multi-agent controller with domain-adapted LLM variants and validate robustness improvements in anomaly-triggered model switching scenarios.\n5) Conduct extensive latency, accuracy, and resource utilization analyses to assess real-time operational feasibility.\n6) Perform user studies with domain experts to evaluate effectiveness of anomaly explanations and trust enhancement.\n7) Examine system resilience and model updating efficacy under simulated concept drift and distributional shifts.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A burst of ambiguous or misleading queries leads to an unexpected spike in perplexity and inconsistency metrics during live service.\nOutput: The causal reasoning layer identifies increased hallucination probability due to novel topic unfamiliarity, generating interpretable explanations highlighting the causative input features and model behavior patterns. Concurrently, the multi-agent system votes to switch serving to a domain-fine-tuned LLM instance better suited for that topic. The system throttles risky queries and notifies the user with transparent risk indicators, thereby preventing misinformation propagation while maintaining low-latency service.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the causal reasoning module achieves limited explanation fidelity, fallback strategies include leveraging simpler interpretable anomaly scoring heuristics combined with enhanced user feedback loops. Should continuous online model updating prove resource-intensive, we will adopt periodic retraining schedules combined with robust threshold-based hybrid detection. Multi-agent voting can revert to a primary-secondary failover model selection to balance complexity and reliability during rollout phases."

Also, it is not fully clear how ML-based anomaly detection models are continuously updated or retrained in the dynamic cloud environment to adapt to distributional shifts. Providing a clearer architectural overview with detailed mechanism for anomaly signal extraction, model updating, and triggering adaptive actions will strengthen the soundness of the proposal's core technical approach by removing ambiguity in its operational flow and resource trade-offs. Such clarity is crucial for convincing the feasibility and practical deployment viability of the method in real-world cloud LLM systems, where latency and reliability constraints are very stringent, especially in critical applications. Consider integrating detailed algorithmic steps or system design diagrams illustrating how streaming intrinsic evaluations seamlessly integrate with anomaly detection and adaptive control loops, highlighting any novel components or optimizations that differentiate from existing monitoring solutions in LLM pipelines or related AI systems frameworks. This will also help reviewers and implementers grasp the novelty and technical contribution more concretely, beyond the combination of known components described currently. Target: Proposed_Method section to include more mechanistic and implementation detail on real-time pipeline, anomaly modeling and adaptive control loops."

          "feedback_content": "Given the 'NOV-COMPETITIVE' novelty rating, the proposal can be strengthened by integrating concepts from 'Responsible Artificial Intelligence' and 'intelligent decision-making' from the global concept list. Specifically, enriching the anomaly detection pipeline with causal reasoning or interpretable decision-layer components can enable the system not only to flag anomalous behavior but explain why the LLM output is suspected to be hallucinating or unreliable. This human-understandable feedback can improve practical usability and trust for downstream users operating critical applications. Furthermore, coupling the intrinsic metric anomaly signals with a multi-agent system framework could enable the switching or voting among multiple model instances (possibly domain-adapted or fine-tuned) to enhance robustness. Such a reasoning/decision layer that leverages vision-language or multi-modal signals (where applicable) to corroborate text-based anomalies could further broaden the impact and novelty, making it distinct from existing anomaly detection methods focusing purely on intrinsic text metrics. These extensions will deepen the idea's alignment with responsible AI goals and intelligent autonomous system design, addressing real-world challenges of transparency, trust, and automated recovery in cloud-deployed LLMs."
