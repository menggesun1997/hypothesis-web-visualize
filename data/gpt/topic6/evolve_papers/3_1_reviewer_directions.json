    "title": "ImmunoAdversarial-LLM: Leveraging Th17 Cell Sensitivity Analogies for Subtle Vulnerability Detection in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Standard adversarial robustness tests miss subtle, biologically analogous vulnerabilities present in LLM behavior, akin to nuanced immunological responses seen in Th17 cell pathways. Detecting these faint yet consequential model fragilities remains an unresolved challenge.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by the 'hidden bridge' connecting immunological sensitivity analyses with AI robustness testing, this project aims to explore immunology-based frameworks to discover fine-grained adversarial weaknesses in LLMs, addressing the core critical gap of subtle vulnerability detection.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Model adversarial perturbations using immunological response analogs, treating subtle input changes like antigen presentations impacting Th17 cell activation thresholds. Develop immune-inspired sensitivity metrics reflecting LLM behavioral shifts in response to minimal input perturbations. Implement an adversarial test suite that probes these thresholds systematically to uncover hidden failure modes.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Survey immunological sensitivity measurement techniques focused on Th17 cells.\n2. Formalize analogies to define 'activation thresholds' in LLM responses.\n3. Construct adversarial example generators guided by these thresholds.\n4. Evaluate on benchmark tasks with stress testing of LLM stability.\n5. Cross-validate findings with human expert assessment on subtle semantic shifts.\n6. Compare immuno-inspired method performance to traditional adversarial attacks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"The cat sat on the mat.\"\nPerturbation: Slight synonym swap \"The feline sat on the mat.\" designed to cross activation threshold.\nExpected Output: Detection of semantic drift or inconsistency indicating subtle vulnerability revealed by immuno-inspired metrics.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct immunology analogies fail to yield detection improvements, pivot to hybrid approaches that combine gradient-based adversarial analysis with statistical outlier detection inspired by immune exclusion principles."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that immunological sensitivity models, specifically Th17 cell activation thresholds, can be directly and meaningfully analogized to subtle adversarial perturbations in LLMs is not sufficiently justified or grounded in theory. The biological mechanisms governing immune cell activation involve complex biochemical and temporal dynamics that lack a straightforward or computationally interpretable counterpart in LLM behavior. Without strong interdisciplinary evidence or precedent, this assumption risks conceptual mismatch and may undermine the validity of the entire approach. The proposal would benefit from a clearer theoretical framework or pilot studies demonstrating the plausibility of this analogy before proceeding with adversarial test development based on it. Consider specifying how immunological constructs translate quantitatively to model sensitivities in LLMs to strengthen soundness and conceptual clarity in the Proposed_Method section.\n\nTargeted clarification on how to operationalize \"activation thresholds\" in the context of LLMs, beyond metaphor, is essential to avoid treating the biological analogy as loosely poetic rather than methodologically rigorous. This will improve confidence in the feasibility and interpretability of the method outputs in subsequent experiments and analyses, and thereby ensure a sound conceptual basis for the projectâ€™s claims and downstream impacts. This critique targets the core conceptual foundations in the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections where the analogy is framed and operationalized.  \n\n"

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "While the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a well-structured progression, it lacks crucial details regarding how the immune-derived sensitivity metrics will be computationally defined, implemented, and integrated into adversarial example generation. For example, how will \"activation thresholds\" be quantitatively measured in LLM response space? What criteria will determine crossing these thresholds, and how will this guide the perturbation synthesis algorithm? Without concrete computational methods or validation protocols, this plan risks being unfeasible or overly speculative.\n\nMoreover, the plan to \"cross-validate findings with human expert assessment on subtle semantic shifts\" is under-specified: the selection process of experts, annotation guidelines, and metrics for agreement or validation remain undefined. Given the project's reliance on subtle semantic vulnerabilities, human evaluation is critical, and a failure to define this rigorously could weaken experimental validity.\n\nFinally, fallback contingencies to pivot towards \"hybrid approaches combining gradient-based adversarial analysis with immune exclusion principles\" are broadly stated but require more concrete criteria and methods to assess failure points and trigger pivots, especially given limited prior work. Clarifying these implementation details and success criteria will greatly increase feasibility and robustness of execution targeting credible empirical contributions. This critique primarily addresses the Experiment_Plan section, emphasizing the need for concrete computational definitions, evaluation protocols, and contingency specifications."
