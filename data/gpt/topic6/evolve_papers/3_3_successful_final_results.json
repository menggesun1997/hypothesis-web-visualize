        "title": "CrossDomain-LLMeval v2: Empirically Grounded Framework Linking Toxicology Risk Assessment and LLM Behavioral Testing with Modular Validation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) lack an interdisciplinary bridge that leverages rigorous quantitative methodologies from toxicology risk assessment, resulting in missed opportunities for nuanced robustness benchmarking. However, the fundamental assumption that toxicological exposure concepts (e.g., dose, threshold, sensitivity) can be meaningfully mapped onto LLM behavioral testing remains unvalidated, and prior frameworks do not sufficiently justify or empirically demonstrate this mapping.",
        "Motivation": "To address the NOV-COMPETITIVE status of prior efforts and build a conceptually sound and operationally feasible interdisciplinary evaluation framework, this work focuses first on empirically validating the core assumption underpinning the toxicology-LLM analogy. By grounding the framework in rigorous pilot studies and a systematic literature synthesis, we aim to establish a theoretically and practically robust foundation, distinguishing our approach through its empirical rigor and modular validation strategy that mitigates risk and promotes incremental advances over existing NLP robustness benchmarks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "1. Conduct an extensive literature synthesis bridging toxicology risk assessment models and computational robustness analyses to identify comparable constructs and metrics.\n2. Design pilot empirical studies to correlate toxicological exposure parameters such as dose-response curves with LLM input perturbation effects and behavioral deviation patterns. For example, mapping graded perturbations (e.g., character-level noise, paraphrasing strength) to response degradation metrics.\n3. Develop a modular evaluation methodology modularizing the toxicology-inspired metrics, enabling independent validation before full integration.\n4. Formalize the cross-domain evaluation framework only after substantial pilot validation, defining mappings between toxicology constructs (dose, threshold, sensitivity) and LLM behavioral testing components (perturbation intensity, response deviation, model vulnerability).\n5. Create controlled datasets simulating dose-like perturbation gradients with explicit documentation of perturbation types (e.g., synonyms replacement, typos, adversarial paraphrases), carefully balancing linguistic plausibility and controlled noise.\n6. Select multiple diverse LLMs (e.g., GPT, LLaMA variants) based on size, training corpora, and known robustness profiles to assess generalization across architectures.\n7. Establish quantitative toxicology-inspired behavioral metrics with explicit operational definitions and measurement protocols, e.g., defining behavioral thresholds as statistically significant drops in task accuracy or consistency across perturbation gradients.\n8. Implement a progressive experiment pipeline: start with independent validation of individual toxicology-inspired metrics on benchmark datasets; once validated, integrate these into composite benchmarks and develop an accompanying analysis toolchain to facilitate joint toxicology-NLP evaluation.\n\nThis rigorous, bottom-up approach contrasts with prior works by grounding cross-domain mappings in reproducible empirical data, thus enhancing conceptual soundness and practical applicability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. **Literature Synthesis:** Systematically review toxicology risk assessment models and computational robustness literature to extract candidate comparable constructs and metrics.\n2. **Pilot Experiments:** Design small-scale experiments perturbing text inputs incrementally (e.g., varying synonym replacement rate from 0% to 30%) and measure LLM output degradation (accuracy drop, semantic consistency loss) to identify dose–response-like relationships.\n3. **Metric Validation:** Define precise metric computations inspired by toxicology (e.g., thresholds where behavioral deviation sharply escalates) and validate their stability and interpretability on a range of LLMs and tasks.\n4. **Dataset Generation:** Create perturbation gradient datasets with well-controlled linguistic and semantic properties, documented perturbation parameters, and control subsets with no perturbation.\n5. **Model Selection:** Choose at least three LLMs differing in size and training regimes to evaluate generalization of findings.\n6. **Sequential Testing:** Apply validated individual toxicology-inspired metrics on dataset-model combinations to test sensitivity and coverage.\n7. **Integration and Benchmarking:** Aggregate validated metrics into an integrated framework and benchmark state-of-the-art robustness methods.\n8. **Toolchain Development:** Build modular software tools enabling reproducible joint toxicology-NLP evaluation with configurable settings.\n9. **Analysis and Interpretation:** Analyze results to identify behavioral vulnerabilities aligned with toxicological analogs, report findings.\n10. **Iterative Refinement:** Based on outcomes, refine mappings and metrics to enhance framework robustness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "1. Applying controlled synonym replacement at increasing percentages (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%) on sentiment analysis datasets as a proxy for 'dose-like' perturbation; measuring model accuracy degradation analogous to immunotoxicity severity.\n2. Using character-level noise injection gradients (e.g., typos, swapped characters) simulating toxicant exposure concentrations and measuring LLM output semantic coherence loss.\n3. Measuring behavioral deviation thresholds where output label flip rates or hallucination rates exceed predefined statistical significance, analogous to toxicological safety thresholds.\n4. Evaluating multiple LLM families (GPT-3, LLaMA 2, OPT) across datasets to observe consistency and divergence in dose–response profiles.\n5. Interpretation of results highlighting perturbation intensities that disproportionately impact models, thus identifying vulnerability zones akin to toxic doses in biological systems.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Given the inherent complexity of direct domain mapping, the project will initially focus on modular validation of individual toxicology-inspired metrics independently, rather than immediate full framework integration. If pilot studies reveal weak or inconsistent analogies, the scope narrows to analyzing specific perturbation-response relationships in LLMs using a rigorous, but single-domain robustness evaluation enhanced with toxicology-informed metrics. Toolchain development proceeds in modular fashion to facilitate gradual adoption and enable future cross-domain expansion. This staged approach mitigates risk by ensuring each component has empirical grounding before scaling to holistic interdisciplinary frameworks."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that toxicology risk assessment methods can be effectively mapped onto LLM behavioral testing lacks clear empirical or theoretical justification. Toxicology and LLM evaluation arise from very different domains—biological vs. computational—and their core constructs (e.g., 'dose' vs. 'input perturbation') may not be analogous or transferable without substantial foundational work. This assumption must be validated or better motivated through preliminary pilot studies or literature synthesis that rigorously demonstrate comparable phenomena or metrics across these domains, to ensure the framework design is grounded in sound interdisciplinary reasoning rather than analogy alone. Clarifying this will strengthen the conceptual soundness and acceptance of the framework proposal; otherwise, the entire premise risks fragility due to unverified cross-domain mappings. Consider dedicating an initial study that empirically correlates toxicological exposure parameters with measurable LLM perturbation effects before committing to composite benchmarks and toolchain integration, as currently proposed in the method and experiment plan sections."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan is ambitious but lacks concrete details on dataset creation, evaluation protocols, and how to quantitatively measure the toxicology-inspired metrics in NLP contexts. For instance, how exactly will 'dose-like perturbation gradients' be simulated in text, what are the criteria for selecting multiple LLMs, and how will behavioral deviation thresholds be operationalized? These methodological specifics are critical to assess feasibility. Without them, executing step 3 (dataset simulation) and step 4 (evaluation using dual-domain metrics) may prove significantly challenging or inconsistent across models. Moreover, the fallback plan to modular validation is insufficiently elaborated and should be integrated earlier to mitigate risk. Strengthen feasibility by outlining concrete dataset generation methods (e.g., types of perturbations, control conditions), well-defined metrics with measurement procedures, and explicit criteria for progressively advancing from individual metrics validation to full framework integration."
