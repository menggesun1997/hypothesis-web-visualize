      "abstract": "Integrating artificial intelligence with food category recognition has been a field of interest for research for the past few decades. It is potentially one of the next steps in revolutionizing human interaction with food. The modern advent of big data and the development of data-oriented fields like deep learning have provided advancements in food category recognition. With increasing computational power and ever-larger food datasets, the approach's potential has yet to be realized. This survey provides an overview of methods that can be applied to various food category recognition tasks, including detecting type, ingredients, quality, and quantity. We survey the core components for constructing a machine learning system for food category recognition, including datasets, data augmentation, hand-crafted feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms. We place a particular focus on the field of deep learning, including the utilization of convolutional neural networks, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning. We provide an overview of relevant studies to promote further developments in food category recognition for research and industrial applications.",

      "abstract": "Electronic health records (EHR) are patient-level information, e.g., laboratory tests and questionnaires, stored in electronic format. Compared to physical records, the EHR alternative allows patients to access their data easily and helps staff with management procedural tasks such as information sharing across different organizations. Moreover, this type of data is commonly used by researchers for predictive and classification purposes, employing statistical and machine learning methods. However, missingness is a phenomenon that is observed very frequently for such measurements. Even though this missingness is often significant, it is usually treated poorly with either case deletion or simple methods, resulting in suboptimal and/or inaccurate predictive results. This happens because the simple methods, e.g., k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and mean/mode imputation, fail in most cases to incorporate the complex relationships that define these medical datasets. To address these limitations, in this paper we test and improve state-of-the-art missing data imputation models and practices. We propose a new missing value imputation method based on denoising autoencoders (DAE) with kNN for the pre-imputation task. We optimize the training methodology by re-applying kNN to the missing data every $N$ epochs using a different value for the variable $k$ each time to yield more accurate results. We also revise a state-of-the-art missing data imputation approach based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). Using this as a baseline, we introduce improvements regarding both the architecture and the training procedure. These models are compared with the ones usually employed within clinical research studies for both the task of imputation and post-imputation prediction. Results show that our proposed deep learning approaches outperform the standard baselines, yielding better imputation and predictive results.",

      "abstract": "Heart disease is one of the most significant causes of mortality in the world today. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is a critical challenge in the area of clinical data analysis. Machine learning (ML) has been shown to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare industry. We have also seen ML techniques being used in recent developments in different areas of the Internet of Things (IoT). Various studies give only a glimpse into predicting heart disease with ML techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel method that aims at finding significant features by applying machine learning techniques resulting in improving the accuracy in the prediction of cardiovascular disease. The prediction model is introduced with different combinations of features and several known classification techniques. We produce an enhanced performance level with an accuracy level of 88.7% through the prediction model for heart disease with the hybrid random forest with a linear model (HRFLM).",

Because of its multilayer structure, deep learning is also appropriate for the edge computing environment. Therefore, in this article, we first introduce deep learning for IoTs into the edge computing environment. Since existing edge nodes have limited processing capability, we also design a novel offloading strategy to optimize the performance of IoT deep learning applications with edge computing. In the performance evaluation, we test the performance of executing multiple deep learning tasks in an edge computing environment with our strategy. The evaluation results show that our method outperforms other optimization solutions on deep learning for IoT.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is one of the biggest cause for morbidity and mortality among the population of the world. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subject in the section of clinical data analysis. The amount of data in the healthcare industry is huge. Data mining turns the large collection of raw healthcare data into information that can help to make informed decision and prediction. There are some existing studies that applied data mining techniques in heart disease prediction. Nonetheless, studies that have given attention towards the significant features that play a vital role in predicting cardiovascular disease are limited. It is crucial to select the correct combination of significant features that can improve the performance of the prediction models. This research aims to identify significant features and data mining techniques that can improve the accuracy of predicting cardiovascular disease. Prediction models were developed using different combination of features, and seven classification techniques: k-NN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network and Vote (a hybrid technique with Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression). Experiment results show that the heart disease prediction model developed using the identified significant features and the best-performing data mining technique (i.e. Vote) achieves an accuracy of 87.4% in heart disease prediction.",

Among all those diseases, heart disease turns out to be the most common disease and the impact of this ailment is dangerous than all other diseases. In this paper, we compared a number of computational intelligence techniques for the prediction of coronary artery heart disease. Seven computational intelligence techniques named as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) were applied and a comparative study was drawn. The performance of each technique was evaluated using Statlog and Cleveland heart disease dataset which are retrieved from the UCI machine learning repository database with several evaluation techniques. From the study, it can be carried out that the highest accuracy of 98.15% obtained by deep neural network with sensitivity and precision 98.67% and 98.01% respectively. The outcomes of the study were compared with the outcomes of the state of the art focusing on heart disease prediction that outperforms the previous study.",

      "year": 2018,
      "citationCount": 355,
      "fieldCitationRatio": 79.0,
      "abstract": " This research studies a support vector machine (SVM)-based ensemble learning algorithm for breast cancer diagnosis. Illness diagnosis plays a critical role in designating treatment strategies, which are highly related to patient safety. Nowadays, numerous classification models in data mining domains are adapted to breast cancer diagnosis based on patients’ historical medical records. However, the performance of each algorithm depends on various model configurations, such as input feature types and model parameters. To tackle the limitation of individual model performance, this research focuses on breast cancer diagnosis that uses an SVM-based ensemble learning algorithm to reduce the diagnosis variance and increase diagnosis accuracy. Twelve different SVMs, based on the proposed Weighted Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Ensemble (WAUCE) approach, are hybridized. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, Wisconsin Breast Cancer, Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer, and the U.S. National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program breast cancer datasets have been studied. The experimental results show that the WAUCE model achieves a higher accuracy with a significantly lower variance for breast cancer diagnosis compared to five other ensemble mechanisms and two common ensemble models, i.e., adaptive boosting and bagging classification tree. The proposed WAUCE model reduces the variance by 97.89% and increases accuracy by 33.34%, compared to the best single SVM model on the SEER dataset. In practice, the proposed methodology can be further applied to other illness diagnoses, which offers an alternative to a safer, more reliable, and more robust illness diagnosis process.",

      "abstract": "Exponential growth of novel radical applications and services in sixth-generation (6G) networks is expected to increase the complexity of managing existing network infrastructures. In this context, the zero touch network and service management (ZSM) paradigm, which leverages AI, SDN, and NFV techniques, is seen as a promising solution to automatically manage and orchestrate network resources. However, due to the closed-loop operation and automated end-to-end framework in a distributed 6G network, the ZSM architecture, along with its potential benefits, is exposed to various security threats. A recently proposed solution to address privacy concerns is federated learning (FL), whereby distributed training is performed, and the aggregated model parameters, instead of clients' raw data, are forwarded to the global server. However, most of the existing FL and semi-supervised learning (SSL) models for intrusion detection are based on the assumption that fully labeled data are always available at the server and client sides, which is not practical due to the high labeling costs and privacy constraints in the 6G network. In this article, we propose a novel FL-empowered semi-supervised active learning (FL-SSAL) security orchestration framework for the Label-at-Client scenario where, along with unlabeled samples, clients have a small portion of labeled data. The entropy-based active learning selects the most informative samples for data annotation and leverages the unlabeled data using a semi-supervised approach. The results of our experimental evaluations performed on the private, not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) dataset demonstrate that FL-SSAL achieves higher intrusion detection accuracy and has less communication overhead than baseline schemes with less labeled data.",

      "abstract": "The recent upsurge of diversified mobile applications, especially those supported by AI, is spurring heated discussions on the future evolution of wireless communications. While 5G is being deployed around the world, efforts from industry and academia have started to look beyond 5G and conceptualize 6G. We envision 6G to undergo an unprecedented transformation that will make it substantially different from the previous generations of wireless cellular systems. In particular, 6G will go beyond mobile Internet and will be required to support ubiquitous AI services from the core to the end devices of the network. Meanwhile, AI will play a critical role in designing and optimizing 6G architectures, protocols, and operations. In this article, we discuss potential technologies for 6G to enable mobile AI applications, as well as AI-enabled methodologies for 6G network design and optimization. Key trends in the evolution to 6G will also be discussed.",

      "year": 1999,
      "citationCount": 7251,
      "fieldCitationRatio": NaN,
      "abstract": "Software radios are emerging as platforms for multiband multimode personal communications systems. Radio etiquette is the set of RF bands, air interfaces, protocols, and spatial and temporal patterns that moderate the use of the radio spectrum. Cognitive radio extends the software radio with radio-domain model-based reasoning about such etiquettes. Cognitive radio enhances the flexibility of personal services through a radio knowledge representation language. This language represents knowledge of radio etiquette, devices, software modules, propagation, networks, user needs, and application scenarios in a way that supports automated reasoning about the needs of the user. This empowers software radios to conduct expressive negotiations among peers about the use of radio spectrum across fluents of space, time, and user context. With RKRL, cognitive radio agents may actively manipulate the protocol stack to adapt known etiquettes to better satisfy the user's needs. This transforms radio nodes from blind executors of predefined protocols to radio-domain-aware intelligent agents that search out ways to deliver the services the user wants even if that user does not know how to obtain them. Software radio provides an ideal platform for the realization of cognitive radio.",

      "abstract": "What will 5G be? What it will not be is an incremental advance on 4G. The previous four generations of cellular technology have each been a major paradigm shift that has broken backward compatibility. Indeed, 5G will need to be a paradigm shift that includes very high carrier frequencies with massive bandwidths, extreme base station and device densities, and unprecedented numbers of antennas. However, unlike the previous four generations, it will also be highly integrative: tying any new 5G air interface and spectrum together with LTE and WiFi to provide universal high-rate coverage and a seamless user experience. To support this, the core network will also have to reach unprecedented levels of flexibility and intelligence, spectrum regulation will need to be rethought and improved, and energy and cost efficiencies will become even more critical considerations. This paper discusses all of these topics, identifying key challenges for future research and preliminary 5G standardization activities, while providing a comprehensive overview of the current literature, and in particular of the papers appearing in this special issue.",

      "abstract": "Reliable data connectivity is vital for the ever increasingly intelligent, automated, and ubiquitous digital world. Mobile networks are the data highways and, in a fully connected, intelligent digital world, will need to connect everything, including people to vehicles, sensors, data, cloud resources, and even robotic agents. Fifth generation (5G) wireless networks, which are currently being deployed, offer significant advances beyond LTE, but may be unable to meet the full connectivity demands of the future digital society. Therefore, this article discusses technologies that will evolve wireless networks toward a sixth generation (6G) and which we consider as enablers for several potential 6G use cases. We provide a full-stack, system-level perspective on 6G scenarios and requirements, and select 6G technologies that can satisfy them either by improving the 5G design or by introducing completely new communication paradigms.",

Moreover, by utilizing advanced information analytics, networked machines will be able to perform more efficiently, collaboratively and resiliently. Such trend is transforming manufacturing industry to the next generation, namely Industry 4.0. At this early development phase, there is an urgent need for a clear definition of CPS. In this paper, a unified 5-level architecture is proposed as a guideline for implementation of CPS.",

      "year": 2020,
      "citationCount": 3456,

      "abstract": "The ongoing deployment of 5G cellular systems is continuously exposing the inherent limitations of this system, compared to its original premise as an enabler for Internet of Everything applications. These 5G drawbacks are spurring worldwide activities focused on defining the next-generation 6G wireless system that can truly integrate far-reaching applications ranging from autonomous systems to extended reality. Despite recent 6G initiatives (one example is the 6Genesis project in Finland), the fundamental architectural and performance components of 6G remain largely undefined. In this article, we present a holistic, forward-looking vision that defines the tenets of a 6G system. We opine that 6G will not be a mere exploration of more spectrum at high-frequency bands, but it will rather be a convergence of upcoming technological trends driven by exciting, underlying services. In this regard, we first identify the primary drivers of 6G systems, in terms of applications and accompanying technological trends. Then, we propose a new set of service classes and expose their target 6G performance requirements. We then identify the enabling technologies for the introduced 6G services and outline a comprehensive research agenda that leverages those technologies. We conclude by providing concrete recommendations for the roadmap toward 6G. Ultimately, the intent of this article is to serve as a basis for stimulating more out-of-the-box research around 6G.",
