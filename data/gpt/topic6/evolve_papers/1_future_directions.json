        "title": "Multi-Modal Semantic Consistency Evaluation for Biomedical LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic evaluation metrics for LLMs inadequately capture domain-specific semantic consistencies, especially in biomedical contexts where textual and visual evidence coexist. This causes overlooked factual inaccuracies and undermines trustworthiness.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal critical gap of limited handling of domain-specific complexities and the external opportunity of multi-modal intrinsic evaluations by integrating visual and textual semantic coherence into intrinsic metrics for biomedical LLMs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel multi-modal intrinsic evaluation framework that combines perplexity and self-consistency metrics with semantic alignment scores derived from cross-modal embeddings between textual outputs and associated biomedical images, charts, or diagrams. This involves a fusion module leveraging joint text-vision transformers adapted for biomedical data, integrating word-cloud visualizations for enhanced semantic context representation. The system dynamically weights multi-modal signals to produce a composite intrinsic metric sensitive to factual and contextual domain correctness.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect biomedical corpora with aligned text and image data (e.g., PubMed Central with figures). 2) Fine-tune BioBERT + Vision Transformer hybrid models for joint embedding learning. 3) Implement the multi-modal intrinsic metric and baseline metrics (perplexity, BLEU, LUNA). 4) Evaluate on biomedical QA and summarization tasks, comparing metric correlations with human trustworthiness and accuracy judgments. 5) Perform ablation to isolate modality contributions.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A biomedical LLM generates a diagnosis explanation supported by an associated diagnostic X-ray image. Output: The evaluation system outputs a high multi-modal intrinsic score if textual descriptions align semantically and visually with the X-ray findings, while a lower score flags discrepancies indicating hallucination or inconsistency.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-modal fusion yields noisy or uncorrelated metrics, fallback to enhanced textual embeddings combined with semantic similarity to structured biomedical ontologies. Alternatively, incorporate expert-in-the-loop evaluations to calibrate multi-modal metric weighting."

        "title": "Ethically-Calibrated Intrinsic Metrics for Healthcare LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Intrinsic evaluation metrics currently neglect ethical, privacy, and legal dimensions crucial for sensitive domain deployments like healthcare, resulting in models that may be accurate but violate fairness or compliance guidelines.",
        "Motivation": "Fills the internal gap of ethical and legal framework integration with intrinsic evaluations, crafting transparent and auditable metrics that quantify fairness, privacy compliance, and accountability alongside conventional accuracy measures for healthcare LLMs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design an intrinsic evaluation suite embedding fairness metrics (demographic parity, equality of opportunity) and privacy risk estimators (measuring potential PII leakage) into LLM intrinsic evaluations. This includes a novel audit module comparing model outputs across protected groups and an interpretable accountability scoring that tracks provenance and decision paths. The framework outputs a composite trustworthiness index designed for regulatory alignment in healthcare.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather healthcare datasets with sensitive attributes (e.g., MIMIC-III with patient demographics). 2) Apply existing LLMs fine-tuned on healthcare text. 3) Use proposed metrics to evaluate outputs on diagnosis and treatment recommendation tasks. 4) Correlate metric scores with known bias incidences and privacy risks. 5) Validate with domain experts to refine interpretability and legal alignment.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An LLM provides treatment recommendations for patients from diverse demographic groups. Output: Metrics reveal disparities in recommendation language or risk profiles, highlighting potential fairness violations, while also scoring privacy risks indicating possible PII exposure.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct ethical metric computation is infeasible, develop proxy measures using synthetic subgroup analyses or data perturbation tests. Additionally, consider embedding chain-of-thought explanations to improve accountability tracking."

        "Problem_Statement": "LLMs deployed in dynamic, cloud-based environments lack mechanisms for real-time intrinsic evaluation to detect hallucinations or model trustworthiness deterioration proactively.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the external gaps of coupling anomaly detection techniques with intrinsic evaluation metrics within cloud environments, enabling continuous, live trustworthiness monitoring of LLMs serving critical applications.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Engineer a streaming intrinsic evaluation pipeline embedded into LLM serving infrastructure that continuously computes perplexity and self-consistency metrics on live queries. Integrate ML-based anomaly detection models trained on historical intrinsic metric distributions to flag unusual behavior. The system triggers alerts and adaptive actions such as query rejection or model switching, allowing real-time trustworthiness control at scale.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Deploy an LLM service on a cloud platform with monitoring hooks. 2) Simulate real-world query streams including adversarial and out-of-distribution inputs. 3) Develop anomaly detection models using unsupervised clustering and temporal pattern mining on intrinsic metric time series. 4) Measure detection accuracy, latency, and impact on service quality. 5) Conduct user studies on alert usefulness and system responsiveness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A sudden spike of queries containing misleading or ambiguous inputs. Output: The system detects anomalies in intrinsic metrics signaling hallucination risk and flags or throttles affected queries to prevent misinformation propagation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If anomaly detection yields excessive false positives, refine feature engineering incorporating additional signals like user feedback or confidence calibrations. Alternatively, deploy a hybrid approach combining threshold and ML-based detection."

        "Motivation": "Addresses the external critical gap regarding integration of word-cloud visualizations with intrinsic evaluations, enabling richer, interpretable multi-dimensional insights into model behavior beyond scalar metrics.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a pipeline that generates dynamic word-cloud visualizations from LLM outputs and reference corpora, capturing term frequency and semantic salience. Combine these visual summaries with numeric intrinsic metrics (perplexity, self-consistency) to create hybrid evaluation reports. Novel metrics quantify divergence in word-cloud embeddings using earth mover's distance, correlating with semantic drift or hallucinations.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets with reference text and LLM outputs across multiple domains. 2) Generate word clouds and convert to vector representations using semantic embeddings. 3) Compute standard intrinsic metrics and the proposed word-cloud divergence metric. 4) Analyze correlations with human interpretability judgments and downstream task performance. 5) Perform user studies assessing interpretability improvements.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM generates a medical summary. Output: Word-cloud divergence metric reveals missing or extra terms compared to reference, visually shown through overlapping word clouds, aiding identification of semantic inconsistencies despite acceptable perplexity scores.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If word-cloud vectors poorly capture semantic differences, explore alternate visualization embeddings like TF-IDF weighted embeddings or hierarchical topic models for richer representation."

Design a calibration framework that fits statistical models linking intrinsic metrics (perplexity, self-consistency) to these factuality outcomes. Introduce confidence intervals and threshold calibration enabling model risk scoring tailored for clinical safety requirements.",

        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Biomedical LLM generates treatment recommendation text. Output: Calibrated metric score accurately predicts factual error probability, enabling downstream system to issue warnings proportional to risk level.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If insufficient expert annotations limit calibration, augment datasets with synthetic factual errors or use weak supervision from structured biomedical knowledge bases for labeling."
