    "title": "CrossDomain-LLMeval: Building a Novel Interdisciplinary Framework Linking Toxicology Risk Assessment and LLM Behavioral Testing",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a fundamental lack of interdisciplinary evaluation benchmarks or frameworks merging toxicology risk assessment methods and LLM intrinsic evaluation, causing missed opportunities for methodology transfer and innovation.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical internal gap of missing bridge concepts by explicitly designing and validating a new cross-domain evaluation framework fusing toxicological exposure models and AI behavioral robustness tests.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a formal evaluation framework with a shared ontology aligning toxicological exposure concepts (dose, threshold, sensitivity) with LLM evaluation attributes (input perturbation magnitude, behavioral deviation, vulnerability). Develop composite benchmarks incorporating toxicology inspired metrics into NLP robustness evaluations, supported by a new toolchain enabling joint analysis.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Extract key toxicology risk assessment components amenable to AI evaluation translation.\n2. Define mapping to LLM behavioral test constructs.\n3. Create datasets simulating dose-like perturbation gradients.\n4. Evaluate multiple LLMs across these datasets with the dual-domain metrics.\n5. Analyze framework effectiveness in exposing behavioral vulnerabilities missed by traditional NLP robustness tests.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Example: Equate BPA exposure dose measures with controlled perturbation intensity in text inputs, and measure LLM response degradation analogous to immunotoxic responses.\nExpected: Identification of behaviorally vulnerable perturbation regions interpreted via toxicology analogs.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct domain mapping proves overly complex, focus on modular components, first validating individual toxicology-inspired metrics independently before full framework integration."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that toxicology risk assessment methods can be effectively mapped onto LLM behavioral testing lacks clear empirical or theoretical justification. Toxicology and LLM evaluation arise from very different domains—biological vs. computational—and their core constructs (e.g., 'dose' vs. 'input perturbation') may not be analogous or transferable without substantial foundational work. This assumption must be validated or better motivated through preliminary pilot studies or literature synthesis that rigorously demonstrate comparable phenomena or metrics across these domains, to ensure the framework design is grounded in sound interdisciplinary reasoning rather than analogy alone. Clarifying this will strengthen the conceptual soundness and acceptance of the framework proposal; otherwise, the entire premise risks fragility due to unverified cross-domain mappings. Consider dedicating an initial study that empirically correlates toxicological exposure parameters with measurable LLM perturbation effects before committing to composite benchmarks and toolchain integration, as currently proposed in the method and experiment plan sections."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan is ambitious but lacks concrete details on dataset creation, evaluation protocols, and how to quantitatively measure the toxicology-inspired metrics in NLP contexts. For instance, how exactly will 'dose-like perturbation gradients' be simulated in text, what are the criteria for selecting multiple LLMs, and how will behavioral deviation thresholds be operationalized? These methodological specifics are critical to assess feasibility. Without them, executing step 3 (dataset simulation) and step 4 (evaluation using dual-domain metrics) may prove significantly challenging or inconsistent across models. Moreover, the fallback plan to modular validation is insufficiently elaborated and should be integrated earlier to mitigate risk. Strengthen feasibility by outlining concrete dataset generation methods (e.g., types of perturbations, control conditions), well-defined metrics with measurement procedures, and explicit criteria for progressively advancing from individual metrics validation to full framework integration."
