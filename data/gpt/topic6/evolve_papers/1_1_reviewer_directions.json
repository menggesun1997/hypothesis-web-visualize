    "title": "Ethically-Calibrated Intrinsic Metrics for Healthcare LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Intrinsic evaluation metrics currently neglect ethical, privacy, and legal dimensions crucial for sensitive domain deployments like healthcare, resulting in models that may be accurate but violate fairness or compliance guidelines.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the internal gap of ethical and legal framework integration with intrinsic evaluations, crafting transparent and auditable metrics that quantify fairness, privacy compliance, and accountability alongside conventional accuracy measures for healthcare LLMs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an intrinsic evaluation suite embedding fairness metrics (demographic parity, equality of opportunity) and privacy risk estimators (measuring potential PII leakage) into LLM intrinsic evaluations. This includes a novel audit module comparing model outputs across protected groups and an interpretable accountability scoring that tracks provenance and decision paths. The framework outputs a composite trustworthiness index designed for regulatory alignment in healthcare.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather healthcare datasets with sensitive attributes (e.g., MIMIC-III with patient demographics). 2) Apply existing LLMs fine-tuned on healthcare text. 3) Use proposed metrics to evaluate outputs on diagnosis and treatment recommendation tasks. 4) Correlate metric scores with known bias incidences and privacy risks. 5) Validate with domain experts to refine interpretability and legal alignment.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An LLM provides treatment recommendations for patients from diverse demographic groups. Output: Metrics reveal disparities in recommendation language or risk profiles, highlighting potential fairness violations, while also scoring privacy risks indicating possible PII exposure.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct ethical metric computation is infeasible, develop proxy measures using synthetic subgroup analyses or data perturbation tests. Additionally, consider embedding chain-of-thought explanations to improve accountability tracking."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines embedding fairness metrics and privacy risk estimators into intrinsic evaluations alongside a novel audit module and accountability scoring. However, the methodological specifics of how these components integrate, compute, and interact within a single, unified framework remain underdeveloped. For instance, the process by which the accountability scoring tracks provenance and decision paths is not clearly described, leaving gaps in reproducibility and soundness. To improve, explicitly detail the algorithmic steps, the nature of the interpretability models used, and how composite scores balance between ethical, privacy, and accuracy metrics to ensure clarity and rigor in the method's mechanism."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is generally appropriate but lacks clarity on some critical aspects impacting feasibility. Gathering and utilizing healthcare datasets with sensitive attributes involves complex privacy and ethical approvals, which can be time-consuming and may limit access or scale of data. The plan should explicitly address data governance strategies, consent, and anonymization protocols to ensure practical execution. Additionally, the correlation step (step 4) and domain expert validation (step 5) could benefit from a more detailed protocol outlining evaluation criteria, expert recruitment, and feedback incorporation to strengthen feasibility and reproducibility."

In particular, aligning the trustworthiness index with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the AI Act and incorporating attribute-based access control concepts from electronic health records security could advance compliance and deployment relevance. Embedding chain-of-thought explanations and explainability modules could also bridge to clinical decision support applications to position the framework as a comprehensive ethical evaluation tool used downstream in healthcare NLP pipelines."
