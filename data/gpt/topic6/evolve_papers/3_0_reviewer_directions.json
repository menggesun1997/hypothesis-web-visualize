    "title": "BioRisk-LLM: Infusing Dose-Response Modelling into Behavioral Consistency Metrics for LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a significant lack of intrinsic evaluation frameworks that integrate biological dose-response principles to assess LLM behavior and robustness. Current models fail to provide interpretable, quantitative thresholds of behavioral deviation akin to toxicological benchmarks, limiting understanding of model risk under adversarial or noisy input.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the critical gap of missing cross-disciplinary evaluation by synthesizing dose-response toxicological modeling with LLM behavioral consistency metrics. This novel approach leverages 'hidden bridge' insights to introduce risk thresholding concepts to AI evaluation, fulfilling the call for robust, interpretable testing paradigms.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop BioRisk-LLM, a behavioral evaluation framework that treats input perturbations as 'dose' increments and measures model response deviations as 'toxicity' analogs. Establish a dose-response curve for LLM output consistency using controlled perturbations ranging from benign to adversarial noise. Define behavioral tolerance thresholds analogous to TDI values, enabling risk categorization of model responses. Integrate statistical dose-response models (e.g., benchmark dose modeling) to fit behavioral data and estimate benchmark behavioral deviation doses (BBDDs).",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select representative LLMs (e.g., GPT-3, PaLM).\n2. Design perturbation schemes (syntactic noise, semantic paraphrases, adversarial examples) with quantifiable intensities.\n3. Collect response outputs and define behavioral deviation metrics (e.g., semantic similarity drop, consistency score).\n4. Fit dose-response models to quantify behavioral risk thresholds.\n5. Evaluate framework robustness across datasets (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE).\n6. Compare against baseline intrinsic evaluation metrics without dose-response integration.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Original question \"What is the capital of France?\" (dose=0)\nPerturbation: Paraphrase with spelling mistakes increasing noise dose\nOutput: Consistent answer \"Paris\" at low doses, deviation or errors at high doses\nExpected: Dose-response curve showing increasing behavioral inconsistency beyond a benchmark dose~0.3 noise intensity.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If dose-response curve fitting is unstable, explore non-parametric smoothing techniques or quantile regression for estimating behavioral thresholds. Alternatively, employ Bayesian hierarchical modeling to capture uncertainty in behavioral risk estimation."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that biological dose-response principles can be meaningfully and directly transposed to language model behavioral evaluation. However, the fundamental nature of biological toxicity and LLM output perturbations differ substantiallyâ€”biological dose responses typically relate to physical/chemical exposures with well-defined physiological effects, whereas LLM perturbations affect complex semantic outputs with varied subjective interpretation. The proposal should provide a more rigorous justification or theoretical framework establishing that dose-response models are suitable and valid for quantifying LLM behavioral consistency and risk thresholds, addressing possible conceptual gaps or misalignments between bio-toxicological phenomena and AI output behaviors to ensure soundness of the core assumption. Without this strengthening, the foundational premise risks being overly simplistic or metaphorical rather than mechanistically solid, potentially undermining validity of subsequent model fitting and risk threshold estimation steps in the proposed method and experiments. This is critical to resolve upfront before implementation steps proceed to avoid misdirected analyses or inconclusive/incoherent results due to foundational mismatch of concepts and domains involved in the analogy used for the new evaluation framework (Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections)."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "While the experiment plan outlines a thoughtful sequence of steps and controls, it lacks concrete details on defining and quantifying the perturbation 'doses' especially across diverse perturbation types (syntactic noise, semantic paraphrases, adversarial examples). Clearly specifying how 'dose' intensity metrics are computed, standardized, and validated for comparability across perturbation schemes is necessary for reproducibility and meaningful dose-response curve fitting. Additionally, the plan should address potential confounding factors such as model stochasticity, response variance, and noise calibration, and incorporate multiple runs or statistical validation to ensure robustness. Moreover, the plan lacks clarity on the criteria for behavioral deviation metrics choice and how these will be correlated or fused with dose levels for fitting benchmark dose models. Including detailed methodological protocols here and preparing for potential data sparsity or model fitting challenges will greatly enhance practical feasibility and reliability of results (Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section)."
