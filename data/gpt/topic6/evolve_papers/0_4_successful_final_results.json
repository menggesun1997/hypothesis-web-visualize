        "title": "Graph-Enhanced Multimodal Depth-Aware Language Probing for Structured Clinical Concept Representation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Intrinsic benchmarking of healthcare large language models (LLMs) currently neglects the rich spatial and anatomical structure available in clinical videos and images, particularly ignoring depth cues that are critical for understanding complex pathological presentations and their spatial context within anatomy.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work has exploited monocular depth estimation to introduce spatial cues into intrinsic LLM probing, these approaches lack explicit modeling of inter-entity spatial relationships and structured anatomical context. We propose to bridge this gap by integrating graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent anatomical and spatial relationships derived from depth and segmentation data. This structured multimodal probing approach leverages relational inductive biases for enhanced grounding, interpretability, and intrinsic evaluation of LLMs, thereby advancing beyond conventional fusion methods and addressing the novelty challenge by introducing graph-based intrinsic evaluation paradigms in clinical LLM benchmarks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Our method involves a multi-stage pipeline that encodes and aligns depth, anatomical structure, and language consistently within intrinsic probe frameworks: (1) From clinical procedural videos (e.g., endoscopy), we extract monocular depth maps alongside segmentation masks of relevant anatomical landmarks, forming a set of spatial nodes with associated features (depth values, segmentation embeddings, and semantic labels derived from clinical notes). (2) We construct anatomical spatial graphs where nodes correspond to these landmarks and edges represent spatial proximities or physiological connections, encoding graph features with a graph neural network (GNN) (e.g., graph convolutional networks or graph attention networks) to capture relational spatial context. (3) Concurrently, we encode corresponding clinical text into LLM embeddings (assuming access to intermediate embeddings or representations from pre-trained clinical LLMs). (4) We design multimodal intrinsic probes that fuse the GNN-processed graph embeddings with language embeddings via cross-modal embedding alignment mechanisms, such as trainable projection heads and similarity scoring functions (e.g., cosine similarity or learned metric functions), enabling rigorous quantification of spatial-semantic alignment within LLM representations. (5) The alignment measurement is formalized as a correlation alignment score that captures how well LLM embeddings semantically ground spatial graph representations. We assume access to synchronized video frames and corresponding clinical text notes to construct these multimodal probes, and that intermediate LLM embedding layers can be accessed for probe insertion. This mechanistic integration ensures reproducibility and evaluation rigor through clearly defined embedding extraction, graph construction, GNN encoding, and similarity scoring pipelines.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect a curated dataset of clinical procedural videos (e.g., endoscopy) with synchronized textual annotations focusing on anatomical landmarks and pathological findings. 2) Extract monocular depth maps using state-of-the-art depth estimation models and segment anatomical landmarks via supervised segmentation networks. 3) Construct spatial graphs representing anatomical relationships using depth and segmentation outputs as nodes and edges. 4) Train and evaluate GNN encoders to generate spatial-context embeddings from these graphs. 5) Extract LLM embeddings from pre-trained clinical LLMs for corresponding textual annotations. 6) Develop and apply multimodal intrinsic probes by projecting GNN and LLM embeddings into a shared space and computing spatial-semantic alignment scores. 7) Benchmark multimodal probes against traditional text-only probes on intrinsic evaluation tasks targeting spatial comprehension. 8) Evaluate downstream impacts via diagnostic accuracy prediction tasks relying on spatial understanding. 9) Analyze alignment metrics, downstream performance, and interpretability to validate the methodâ€™s efficacy and superiority.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An endoscopic video frame with an associated monocular depth map and segmentation mask highlighting a lesion adjacent to key anatomical landmarks, accompanied by a clinical text note describing lesion location and morphology. Expected Output: The intrinsic probe yields a high spatial-semantic alignment score reflecting strong congruence between the graph-structured depth and segmentation features and the LLM's textual representations. Detection of misalignment when lesion location descriptions are contradictory or absent. Visualizable embeddings and graph attention weights illuminate the LLM's spatial grounding fidelity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If monocular depth estimation or segmentation proves too noisy to reliably construct anatomical graphs, fallback to simpler spatial representations such as coarse anatomical landmark embeddings (e.g., bounding boxes or keypoints without explicit depth) combined with textual features. Additionally, explore lightweight graph approximations or spatial relationship heuristics (e.g., adjacency matrices derived from known anatomical atlases) to preserve some relational inductive bias. In parallel, refine the probe design to tolerate noisy inputs via robust similarity metrics or contrastive learning to enhance intrinsic evaluation resilience."

The operational details of embedding depth information within language model embeddings or probing methods are not fully articulated. Concrete mechanisms (e.g., model architectures, feature fusion strategies, or similarity metrics) should be detailed to confirm the soundness of the approach and guide reproducibility and evaluation rigorously. Without this, the method risks being conceptually appealing but practically vague and underspecified, weakening the soundness of the contribution. Please clarify and expand on the mechanistic integration steps and formulation of the depth-text alignment measurement within the LLM framework in the Proposed_Method section, including any assumptions on data formats, model access levels, or probe construction steps that support the method's validity and reproducibility."

By representing spatially situated clinical concepts and depth cues as graph-structured data, the intrinsic probes could exploit relational inductive biases for improved grounding and interpretability. This integration could augment the multimodal depth-aware probing approach by enabling structured reasoning over the anatomical graph representations, potentially enhancing the impact and novelty beyond current monocular depth estimation fusion methods. Exploring this could also align well with downstream diagnostic tasks requiring spatial context reasoning. Consider outlining a preliminary plan to incorporate GNN models or similar structures to capture anatomical and spatial relations as part of the Proposed_Method or future work."
