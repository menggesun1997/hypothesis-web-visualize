    "title": "Efficient Intrinsic Probing via Few-Shot Clinical Segmentation-Driven Language Tasks",
    "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource clinical domains suffer from limited annotated data for intrinsic evaluation of LLMs. Current intrinsic probing techniques require extensive labeled datasets, hampering scalable and efficient assessment.",
    "Motivation": "Adapts strategies from ISBI few-shot segmentation challenges and human activity recognition to intrinsic probing for language, innovating sample-efficient intrinsic benchmark designs that support scalable evaluation in low-resource healthcare contexts, addressing internal gaps of training inefficiency and external lack of low-resource adaptability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Propose a few-shot intrinsic probing framework where limited annotated clinical text samples with segmentation-like structure labels (e.g., entity boundaries) guide probe design. Utilize meta-learning and contrastive learning for intrinsic feature extraction and evaluation, enabling generalized intrinsic probing from few examples.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Prepare few-shot annotated clinical text datasets with segmentation of key entities (e.g., diseases, treatments). 2) Train meta-learned intrinsic probes on base domains, test on unseen clinical subdomains. 3) Compare to standard intrinsic probes trained with full data. 4) Evaluate using probe accuracy, sample efficiency, domain adaptability metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Few annotated clinical sentences delineating symptom mentions; Expected Output: Intrinsic probe accurately segments and identifies relevant symptoms from new clinical texts with few-shot supervision, demonstrating efficient intrinsic language understanding assessment.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If few-shot training fails to generalize, incorporate synthetic data augmentation or explore unsupervised intrinsic probing methods that leverage self-supervised signal from unlabeled clinical corpora."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed method combines meta-learning and contrastive learning for few-shot intrinsic probing, the mechanism by which segmentation-like structure labels directly support intrinsic probing of language models is underdeveloped. Clarify how the segmentation annotations translate into effective intrinsic probes, detail the probe architectures, and specify how meta-learning and contrastive approaches integrate to yield generalizable intrinsic features. This will improve the soundness and reproducibility of the method, reducing ambiguity in core technique execution and evaluation metrics definitions, such as precisely what intrinsic features are probed and how they relate to downstream clinical understanding tasks. Include an illustrative example or schematic if possible to concretize the concept's internal logic and make it more convincing and actionable for implementation and peer critique in a competitive research environment."

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan is broadly described but lacks specific details about key practical aspects needed for realistic feasibility assessment. For example, clearly specify which clinical datasets will be used or how annotation for entity segmentation will be obtained or simulated in a low-resource setting. Define the exact meta-learning protocols and evaluation splits to rigorously test domain generalization. Quantify expected annotation budgets, compute resources, and timeline estimates to ensure the approach is tractable within typical research constraints. Additionally, elaborate on the fallback plan's implementation details and decision criteria when few-shot probing fails, to demonstrate robustness of the experimental approach. Providing these details will solidify the planâ€™s feasibility and help reviewers and future researchers reproduce or build upon the results in a fair and contextualized manner."
