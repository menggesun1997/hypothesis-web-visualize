Their use in healthcare, in particular, holds out promising prospects for improving medical practices. As we highlight in this paper, LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation that could indeed be put to good use in the medical field. We also present the main architectures of these models, such as GPT, Bloom, or LLaMA, composed of billions of parameters. We then examine recent trends in the medical datasets used to train these models. We classify them according to different criteria, such as size, source, or subject (patient records, scientific articles, etc.). We mention that LLMs could help improve patient care, accelerate medical research, and optimize the efficiency of healthcare systems such as assisted diagnosis. We also highlight several technical and ethical issues that need to be resolved before LLMs can be used extensively in the medical field. Consequently, we propose a discussion of the capabilities offered by new generations of linguistic models and their limitations when deployed in a domain such as healthcare.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Structure and Content-Guided Video Synthesis with Diffusion Models', 'abstract': 'Text-guided generative diffusion models unlock powerful image creation and editing tools. Recent approaches that edit the content of footage while retaining structure require expensive re-training for every input or rely on error-prone propagation of image edits across frames. In this work, we present a structure and content-guided video diffusion model that edits videos based on descriptions of the desired output. Conflicts between user-provided content edits and structure representations occur due to insufficient disentanglement between the two aspects. As a solution, we show that training on monocular depth estimates with varying levels of detail provides control over structure and content fidelity. A novel guidance method, enabled by joint video and image training, exposes explicit control over temporal consistency. Our experiments demonstrate a wide variety of successes; fine-grained control over output characteristics, customization based on a few reference images, and a strong user preference towards results by our model.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation', 'abstract': 'There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin.

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build “fully convolutional” networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet [20]), the VGG net [1], and GoogLeNet [2]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning [3] to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20% relative improvement to 62.2% mean IV on 2012), NYVDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Delving Deep into Rectifiers: Surpassing Human-Level Performance on ImageNet Classification', 'abstract': 'Rectified activation units (rectifiers) are essential for state-of-the-art neural networks. In this work, we study rectifier neural networks for image classification from two aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on the learnable activation and advanced initialization, we achieve 4.94% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset.

This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Moreover, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, hundreds of twitter users have posted their own artistic experiments using our system.

However, these models also pose a danger of perpetuating biases and delivering incorrect medical diagnoses, which can have a direct, harmful impact on medical care. We aimed to assess whether GPT-4 encodes racial and gender biases that impact its use in health care.\\nMETHODS: Using the Azure OpenAI application interface, this model evaluation study tested whether GPT-4 encodes racial and gender biases and examined the impact of such biases on four potential applications of LLMs in the clinical domain-namely, medical education, diagnostic reasoning, clinical plan generation, and subjective patient assessment. We conducted experiments with prompts designed to resemble typical use of GPT-4 within clinical and medical education applications. We used clinical vignettes from NEJM Healer and from published research on implicit bias in health care. GPT-4 estimates of the demographic distribution of medical conditions were compared with true US prevalence estimates. Differential diagnosis and treatment planning were evaluated across demographic groups using standard statistical tests for significance between groups.\\nFINDINGS: We found that GPT-4 did not appropriately model the demographic diversity of medical conditions, consistently producing clinical vignettes that stereotype demographic presentations. The differential diagnoses created by GPT-4 for standardised clinical vignettes were more likely to include diagnoses that stereotype certain races, ethnicities, and genders. Assessment and plans created by the model showed significant association between demographic attributes and recommendations for more expensive procedures as well as differences in patient perception.\\nINTERPRETATION: Our findings highlight the urgent need for comprehensive and transparent bias assessments of LLM tools such as GPT-4 for intended use cases before they are integrated into clinical care. We discuss the potential sources of these biases and potential mitigation strategies before clinical implementation.\\nFUNDING: Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Performance of ChatGPT on USMLE: Potential for AI-assisted medical education using large language models', 'abstract': 'We evaluated the performance of a large language model called ChatGPT on the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE), which consists of three exams: Step 1, Step 2CK, and Step 3.

Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we are exploring ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization.

    "current_research_landscape": "The current research landscape centers on leveraging large language models (LLMs) for healthcare applications, focusing on intrinsic benchmarking through language understanding capabilities grounded in domain-specific datasets. Central to this is the deployment of LLMs trained on diverse medical datasets to improve healthcare system efficiency, medical education, and clinical decision-making. The dominant methodologies integrate deep learning techniques such as convolutional networks and end-to-end training paradigms familiar from biomedical segmentation, adapted into language understanding contexts. The thematic structure reveals three core clusters: (1) video and joint structure-content modeling approaches highlight advances in multimodal content manipulation, (2) the deep supervised learning frameworks exemplified by U-Net and semantic segmentation architectures provide insights on efficient training with limited annotated data, and (3) domain-specific medical datasets and language understanding critical for healthcare efficiency. Bridging nodes like segmentation of neuronal structures reflect methodological crossovers, underscoring the field’s progressive attempt to harness both advanced model architectures and domain knowledge for intrinsic LLM benchmarking in medical language tasks.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internally, the evolutionary trajectory uncovers notable limitations: the majority of research focuses heavily on model architectures and dataset curation but insufficiently addresses biases encoded in LLMs, particularly demographic and social biases in healthcare contexts, as highlighted by GPT-4's documented stereotyping. There is a persistent under-exploration of bias mitigation strategies in intrinsic benchmarking protocols. Moreover, training efficiency and interpretability remain elusive challenges; despite deep models achieving strong performance, reliable and transparent evaluation of intrinsic language understanding remains limited. Externally, global context analysis reveals overlooked cross-disciplinary bridges—for example, integration of advanced human activity recognition and physical activity monitoring techniques (from video-based deep learning fields) into healthcare LLM evaluation protocols. Additionally, approaches from data management and cybersecurity, such as federated learning and privacy-preserving algorithms, remain largely untapped, despite their relevance to sensitive healthcare data and model robustness. Finally, the intersect of joint video understanding and healthcare system efficiency suggests a missing opportunity to incorporate multimodal signals for richer intrinsic benchmarking frameworks.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "1. Development of Bias-Aware Intrinsic Benchmarking Protocols: Leverage insights from the bias evaluation studies on GPT-4 and combine with privacy-preserving federated learning frameworks (from global cybersecurity and data management findings) to create benchmarking suites that intrinsically measure fairness, robustness, and bias mitigation effectiveness in LLMs for healthcare. This addresses both internal gaps in bias handling and external needs for data security.\n\n2. Multimodal Joint Understanding for Holistic Benchmarking: Exploit the hidden bridge between joint video synthesis/monocular depth estimation and medical LLM language understanding by developing intrinsic probes that incorporate multimodal signals (e.g., clinical images and text) to evaluate LLMs’ integrated comprehension capabilities and enhance explainability in clinical contexts.\n\n3. Efficient Training and Evaluation for Low-Resource Clinical Domains: Inspired by the ISBI challenge successes in segmentation with few annotated samples and global opportunities in human activity recognition, design training and intrinsic probing methodologies that maximize learning efficiency and adaptability of LLMs with limited annotated clinical data, enabling scalable deployment in diverse healthcare settings."
