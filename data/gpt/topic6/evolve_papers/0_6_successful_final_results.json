        "title": "Multi-View Fusion Adaptive Intrinsic Probes via Dynamic Clinical Activity Pattern Embeddings for Healthcare LLM Benchmarking",
        "Problem_Statement": "Intrinsic probes for healthcare large language models (LLMs) exhibit limited adaptability and robustness across diverse clinical subdomains characterized by heterogeneous linguistic usage, scarce annotated data, and varying clinical practices. Conventional unimodal embedding approaches inadequately capture complex cross-domain interactions, resulting in reduced benchmarking accuracy and biased internal evaluations under domain shifts.",
        "Motivation": "Building upon adaptive human activity recognition embedding techniques and recognizing the challenges highlighted by competitive existing methods, this research advances intrinsic probing by systematically integrating multi-view fusion to incorporate heterogeneous clinical language embeddings combined with orthogonal data modalities such as patient activity sensor data. This fusion of multimodal signals representing clinical realities addresses internal weaknesses in training efficiency and external cross-domain applicability gaps more effectively. By explicitly modeling and dynamically adapting embedding manifolds through a mathematically grounded architecture, the approach promises a distinct methodological innovation that enhances intrinsic probe fidelity, bias detection, and generalization under few-shot cross-domain shifts. Incorporating network biology-informed structured regularization and nutrition domain ontologies further enriches semantic representation, positioning this work to achieve superior robustness and interpretability beyond existing adaptive probing techniques.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel multi-view fusion adaptive intrinsic probing framework combining: (1) Clinical language embeddings derived from transformer-based encoders pretrained on diverse specialties; (2) Human activity pattern embeddings extracted from wearable sensor data capturing patient behavior to contextualize clinical semantics; and (3) Structured semantic regularization modules informed by network biology and nutritional science ontologies. \n\nFormally, for an input clinical instance x comprising textual data T and sensor data S, separate embedding functions f_T and f_S map these modalities into latent manifolds E_T = f_T(T) and E_S = f_S(S). These are then fused via a learned multi-view fusion network F, producing a unified embedding E = F(E_T, E_S). The intrinsic probe P, parameterized by θ, operates on E to evaluate model understanding and bias.\n\nDynamic adaptation is enabled through meta-learning: a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) style outer loop optimizes θ for rapid fine-tuning, while inner loop updates adjust the fusion parameters and modality-specific encoders to new clinical specialties with few-shot samples. This adaptation updates embedding manifolds to maintain probe fidelity and bias detection across domain shifts.\n\nAlgorithm pseudocode snippet:\n1. Initialize θ, f_T, f_S, F parameters.\n2. For each training specialty:\n   a. Obtain modality embeddings E_T, E_S.\n   b. Fuse: E = F(E_T, E_S).\n   c. Compute probe outputs P(E; θ).\n   d. Calculate loss L (e.g., intrinsic task loss + bias regularization).\n3. Apply MAML to update θ, f_T, f_S, F for rapid adaptation.\n4. During few-shot adaptation, fine-tune fusion and encoder parameters minimizing L on new specialty data.\n\nThis mechanism differentiates from prior works by explicitly leveraging multi-view fusion to integrate orthogonal clinical signals, applying meta-learned adaptation over embedding manifolds, and regularizing embeddings via domain-specific ontologies, ensuring robustness, efficiency, and novel contributions in probing healthcare LLMs under challenging domain variability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate multi-modal clinical datasets comprising diverse specialties, including clinical notes and corresponding patient wearable sensor data.\n2) Pretrain modality-specific encoders and fusion networks on core specialties.\n3) Implement and validate the meta-learning adaptation framework for few-shot fine-tuning on low-resource specialties.\n4) Evaluate intrinsic probe fidelity by benchmark tasks assessing clinical concept comprehension and bias detection across seen and unseen domains.\n5) Perform ablation studies isolating contributions of multi-view fusion, meta-learning adaptation, and ontology-based regularization.\n6) Compare methods quantitatively against state-of-the-art fixed and adaptive intrinsic probes without multi-view integration.\n7) Analyze embedding manifold dynamics to interpret adaptation behavior and domain shift resilience.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sparse clinical notes and limited wearable sensor streams from a rare specialty (e.g., congenital disorders of glycosylation patient data).\nExpected Output: The adaptive intrinsic probe rapidly fine-tunes to integrate heterogeneous modalities, preserving high clinical comprehension accuracy and detecting latent biases despite domain shifts.\n\nInput: Multimodal data including nutritional logs combined with clinical notes for patients with metabolic disorders.\nExpected Output: Enhanced semantic embedding leveraging International Union of Nutritional Sciences ontologies leading to improved diagnostic insight in probing tasks.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-view fusion or meta-learning adaptation fails to sufficiently improve domain adaptation, the fallback plan involves: (a) Augmenting probes with curated external knowledge bases specialized in clinical and biomedical domains to enrich embeddings; (b) Introducing domain adversarial training to enhance embedding invariance to domain shifts; (c) Exploring graph neural network architectures to explicitly model network biology relationships and enforce structured regularization; and (d) Investigating plug-in artificial intelligence agent modules to simulate interactive human activity reasoning to generate synthetic rich multi-view data augmentations, thus bolstering probe generalization and novelty."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks clarity on how embeddings of 'human clinical activity concepts' will be constructed and adapted. The mechanism by which few-shot fine-tuning adjusts embedding manifolds to maintain intrinsic probe fidelity and bias detection across domains requires elaboration. Specifically, detail the mathematical formulation or learning architecture enabling dynamic adaptation, and how it differs from or improves upon current adaptive probing techniques, to strengthen the methodological soundness of this approach and convince reviewers of its novelty and efficacy in variable clinical contexts. Without this, the premise risks being perceived as overly speculative or incremental despite promising motivation and goals, limiting the confidence in soundness of the method itself. Consider including a concrete model design or algorithm pseudocode in the proposal for clarity and rigor in this critical component of the approach, thereby enhancing review quality and feasibility assessment accuracy at subsequent stages. Targeting the embedding adaptation mechanism will thus reinforce the core contribution claim and early feasibility assumptions simultaneously. The proposal’s impact depends strongly on this mechanism’s validity and distinctiveness from existing approaches; explaining this clearly will help justify its potential impact and novelty in a competitive field, beyond an incremental composition of known techniques, which is indicated as a challenge from the preliminary novelty assessment results. This makes it a foundational improvement area if the project is to succeed convincingly and make a meaningful field contribution beyond the state-of-the-art intrinsic probes for healthcare LLMs under domain shifts and data scarcity conditions identified in the Problem_Statement and Motivation sections. Revisiting and explicitly outlining this part accordingly is essential before progressing further evaluations or resource commitments for the project, to avoid downstream risks and to foster external stakeholder confidence in method innovation and expected impact gains. Thus, addressing this critique must take precedence to solidify the project’s scientific rigor and distinctiveness early on in the research plan development cycle, simultaneously clarifying and justifying the method's novelty and applicability scope claims in the context of existing literature and technical approaches, which will also assist refining objectives and evaluation criteria downstream in the Experiment_Plan and Deliverables sections for overall coherence and impact optimization of the final research outputs and publications arising from the project."

          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty assessment indicates a competitive area, integrating insights from 'multi-view fusion' could substantively enhance the proposal's impact and novelty. Specifically, consider leveraging multi-view fusion models to combine heterogeneous clinical language embeddings with orthogonal data modalities — for example, patient activity data or sensor-derived human activity pattern embeddings — to create richer, more robust intrinsic probes that capture latent cross-domain interactions more effectively. This would extend the current approach beyond unimodal language embeddings and could address domain shift issues more comprehensively by correlating multi-view signals reflecting clinical realities. Moreover, using multi-view fusion can improve adaptation efficiency and resilience across diverse specialties by harmonizing complementary information sources, a strategy well-aligned with the proposal’s dynamic adaptation aims. This integration could also open unique research contributions leveraging network biology concepts for structured embedding regularization, or nutritional science domain ontologies from the International Union of Nutritional Sciences for specialized biomedical semantic enrichment, further differentiating the proposed probes and expanding potential application impact areas. Such a multidisciplinary fusion approach can elevate the project’s competitiveness, deepening both theoretical novelty and practical utility of intrinsic probes in healthcare LLM benchmarking, potentially attracting broader interdisciplinary interest and higher impact publication venues."
