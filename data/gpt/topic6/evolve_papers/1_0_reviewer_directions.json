    "title": "Multi-Modal Semantic Consistency Evaluation for Biomedical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic evaluation metrics for LLMs inadequately capture domain-specific semantic consistencies, especially in biomedical contexts where textual and visual evidence coexist. This causes overlooked factual inaccuracies and undermines trustworthiness.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal critical gap of limited handling of domain-specific complexities and the external opportunity of multi-modal intrinsic evaluations by integrating visual and textual semantic coherence into intrinsic metrics for biomedical LLMs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel multi-modal intrinsic evaluation framework that combines perplexity and self-consistency metrics with semantic alignment scores derived from cross-modal embeddings between textual outputs and associated biomedical images, charts, or diagrams. This involves a fusion module leveraging joint text-vision transformers adapted for biomedical data, integrating word-cloud visualizations for enhanced semantic context representation. The system dynamically weights multi-modal signals to produce a composite intrinsic metric sensitive to factual and contextual domain correctness.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect biomedical corpora with aligned text and image data (e.g., PubMed Central with figures). 2) Fine-tune BioBERT + Vision Transformer hybrid models for joint embedding learning. 3) Implement the multi-modal intrinsic metric and baseline metrics (perplexity, BLEU, LUNA). 4) Evaluate on biomedical QA and summarization tasks, comparing metric correlations with human trustworthiness and accuracy judgments. 5) Perform ablation to isolate modality contributions.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A biomedical LLM generates a diagnosis explanation supported by an associated diagnostic X-ray image. Output: The evaluation system outputs a high multi-modal intrinsic score if textual descriptions align semantically and visually with the X-ray findings, while a lower score flags discrepancies indicating hallucination or inconsistency.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-modal fusion yields noisy or uncorrelated metrics, fallback to enhanced textual embeddings combined with semantic similarity to structured biomedical ontologies. Alternatively, incorporate expert-in-the-loop evaluations to calibrate multi-modal metric weighting."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method hinges on combining perplexity, self-consistency, and cross-modal semantic alignment via joint text-vision transformers, which is a sophisticated approach. However, the description lacks clarity on how dynamically weighted multi-modal signals will be integrated and balanced within the composite metric, especially considering potential conflicts between textual and visual modalities. The mechanism for fusing word-cloud visualizations with cross-modal embeddings also remains vague. To improve soundness, explicitly detail the architecture of the fusion module, how weights are learned or adapted, and how semantic alignment scores are calculated and normalized to ensure interpretability and robustness against noisy or contradictory input signals in biomedical contexts. This clarity is crucial to validate the core mechanism's feasibility and expected behavior in practice, underpinning the claimed semantic consistency capability of the evaluation metric, particularly given the complexity of multi-modal biomedical data and potential modality discrepancies inherent in clinical imaging and text correlations, which can greatly affect factual correctness detection and trustworthiness assessments in LLM outputs for biomedical applications.\","

          "feedback_content": "The Experiment_Plan is reasonably well-structured but under-specifies important practical aspects impacting feasibility. For example, the plan suggests fine-tuning BioBERT plus Vision Transformer hybrids but omits details on handling the inherent challenges in aligning images, which may be of varying types and modalities (X-rays, charts, diagrams) with text. It also lacks explicit mention of data pre-processing, quality controls, and validation splits, which are crucial for biomedical domain data. The plan does not explain how human trustworthiness and accuracy judgments will be collected, which is a non-trivial and expensive process often requiring expert raters and annotation protocols. Clarify these steps and consider potential bottlenecks in obtaining high-quality multi-modal paired data and robust, reproducible evaluation benchmarks. Additionally, specify contingency planning for negative or ambiguous correlation results between the new metric and human judgments to ensure the practicality and scientific credibility of the evaluation."
