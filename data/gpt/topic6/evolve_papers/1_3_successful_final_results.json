    "Problem_Statement": "Intrinsic evaluation frameworks miss opportunities to leverage visual summaries like word clouds to enhance interpretability and fine-grained semantic assessment of LLM outputs.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external critical gap regarding integration of word-cloud visualizations with intrinsic evaluations, enabling richer, interpretable multi-dimensional insights into model behavior beyond scalar metrics.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a pipeline that generates dynamic word-cloud visualizations from LLM outputs and reference corpora, capturing term frequency and semantic salience.

        "title": "Vision-Language Grounded Narrative Visualization and Semantic Divergence Metrics for Multi-Modal Intrinsic Evaluation of LLM Outputs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic evaluation frameworks largely rely on scalar numeric metrics and simplistic lexical overlap visualizations, lacking robust semantic grounding and interactive, human-centered interpretability tools. Specifically, traditional word-cloud based visualizations emphasize term frequency but fall short in reliably capturing nuanced semantic drift or hallucination in LLM-generated text, limiting interpretability and trustworthiness assessments, especially in high-stakes domains like medical summarization.",
        "Motivation": "This work addresses the competitive yet critical gap of integrating advanced vision-language models and narrative visualization techniques within intrinsic evaluation pipelines to enhance semantic fidelity, interpretability, and end-to-end utility. By moving beyond superficial lexical overlap metrics toward semantically rich, multi-modal embeddings and interactive visual narratives, our approach offers fundamentally novel interpretability insights and actionable evaluation feedback, aligning with contemporary trends in human-centered AI and intelligent decision-making. This detailed semantic grounding coupled with rigorous empirical validation strengthens methodological rigor and addresses foundational skepticism prevalent in current visualization plus intrinsic metric combinations.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel evaluation pipeline that: (1) extracts dynamic, term-level visual summaries from LLM outputs and reference corpora, embedding each word-cloud element into a shared semantic space using pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP. This embedding transcends pure frequency counts by incorporating contextual semantics and visual grounding, disambiguating polysemy and contextual shifts. (2) Applies dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., UMAP) on these embeddings to capture intrinsic semantic geometry, facilitating robust computation of semantic divergences. (3) Computes earth mover’s distance (EMD) and complementary multi-modal divergence metrics over these grounded embeddings to quantify semantic drift or hallucinations. (4) Constructs interactive, narrative-driven multi-modal visualizations that enable users to explore semantic inconsistencies dynamically, highlighting temporal patterns, salient lexical shifts with contextual tooltips, and cross-modal explanations — integrating linguistic, visual, and temporal dimensions inspired by narrative visualization principles. (5) Integrates this pipeline within practical end-to-end scenarios such as electronic health record summarization and intelligent decision-making systems, emphasizing real-world applicability and impact. To ensure soundness, we detail the embedding extraction mechanisms, provide theoretical justifications for the chosen metrics in high-dimensional semantic spaces, and proactively plan ablation and embedding robustness studies early in the validation phase to mitigate risks. This approach importantly differentiates our method from prior works by fusing vision-language grounding with narrative multi-modal interpretability in an end-to-end, domain-relevant evaluation context.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate multi-domain datasets with paired reference texts and LLM-generated outputs, emphasizing high-stakes domains such as medical and legal summarizations, selecting corpora based on real-world relevance and diversity criteria. 2) Develop the embedding extraction pipeline using pre-trained CLIP and similar vision-language models, applying and validating dimensionality reduction like UMAP, with ablation studies to assess semantic fidelity and stability under polysemy and context shifts. 3) Compute standard intrinsic metrics alongside the proposed multi-modal semantic divergence metrics, assessing statistical robustness. 4) Design and conduct rigorously controlled user studies involving diverse participant cohorts (e.g., domain experts and NLP researchers), employing mixed-methods assessment frameworks combining qualitative feedback, quantitative interpretability scales, and behavioral tasks to validate interpretability gains attributable specifically to our interactive narrative visualizations and semantic metrics. Power analyses will guide participant sampling to ensure statistical significance. 5) Correlate metric outputs with human judgments and downstream task performance, including decision-support scenarios, to demonstrate end-to-end utility. 6) Iterate on visualization and metric components incorporating user feedback to refine interpretability and usability. 7) Document comprehensive ablation experiments and fallback analyses, including exploring alternative embeddings or hierarchical topic-based representations, should vision-language embedding approaches underperform.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: A medical summary generated by an LLM is evaluated using our method. The vision-language grounded embeddings reveal semantic divergences not visible via perplexity or BLEU scores — for instance, missing critical terms like 'ischemia' replaced by near-synonymous but contextually inappropriate terms. Our interactive narrative visualization highlights these divergences with dynamic overlays and contextual explanations, enabling clinicians to identify hallucinations or omissions effectively. Example 2: In electronic health records summarization, temporal changes and semantic drifts across patient notes are captured by our narrative timeline visualizations, assisting healthcare professionals in monitoring disease progression details that correlate with downstream diagnostic accuracy. These examples underline the method’s capacity to surface meaningful interpretability insights that complement and surpass traditional metrics.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If vision-language grounded embeddings or earth mover’s distance metrics demonstrate insufficient stability or semantic fidelity in pilot studies, we will explore alternate multi-modal embedding strategies such as TF-IDF weighted semantic embeddings combined with hierarchical topic modeling to incorporate global document structure. We will also investigate augmented hierarchical transformation models for embedding clouds, and integrate secondary video or action segmentation features inspired by multi-sensor fusion to bolster semantic representations. Additionally, if interactive narrative visualizations prove challenging in early user testing, we will iteratively simplify interfaces and incorporate user-centric design principles from narrative visualization literature to improve accessibility while preserving semantic richness."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method hinges on generating and comparing word-cloud visualizations converted into vector embeddings to detect semantic divergence. However, the mechanism by which word clouds—which traditionally emphasize frequency—can reliably capture semantic nuances, especially in the presence of polysemy or contextual shifts, is not fully clarified. The method also needs clearer justification on why earth mover's distance on these embeddings robustly correlates with semantic drift or hallucinations, considering the high dimensionality and noise inherent in word representations. To strengthen soundness, the authors should explicate the embedding extraction process, the dimensionality reduction (if any), and provide preliminary evidence or theoretical rationale supporting the fidelity of this approach to capture meaningful semantic differences beyond surface term frequency changes, ensuring the method is not merely a repackaging of superficial lexical overlap metrics rather than genuine semantic evaluation tools. This clarity is essential so reviewers and downstream users can trust that the method quantifies meaningful interpretability signals rather than artefacts of visualization or embedding choices, thus ensuring the pipeline’s core assumptions and mechanisms are well supported and reproducible in practice, not solely theoretically motivated or heuristic-based. Targeted ablation or validation studies on embedding robustness should be planned early on to mitigate foundational risks up front rather than post-hoc fallbacks, reinforcing the pipeline’s soundness and interpretability claims cohesively and transparently within the Proposed_Method section.  This will facilitate adoption and meaningful critique in this competitive paradigm, where incremental marker innovations rarely suffice alone without rigorous grounding of newly proposed interpretability metrics and visualization integration techniques. The method’s novelty and impact hinge on this firm underlying mechanism clarity and empirical validation of claimed semantic insights extracted from such word-cloud augmented hybrid metrics, requiring more detailed articulation now to mitigate skepticism about effective semantic granularity capture capabilities inherent in the approach’s core design choices and selected distance metric applications on visualized data embeddings in NLP intrinsic evaluation pipelines for LLMs today and in near-future practical use cases such as medical summarization or other high-stakes domain applications described in the test cases. \"Is the semantic drift truly captured or only noisy lexical overlap?\" remains a key risk to be addressed explicitly in the revised proposal to ensure soundness at the core methodological level prior to experimental efforts having meaningful interpretability value potential later on across domains and user communities as claimed by the idea's motivation and scope of impact statements. Such clarifications will also help differentiate the approach concretely from competitive baseline or existing visualization plus metric combination approaches dominating the field today, emphasizing sound methodological rigor and validity for a stronger review outcome and adoption likelihood from the community perspective within premiere venues such as ACL or NeurIPS."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is generally well structured, but critical feasibility issues arise in aligning the proposed word-cloud divergence metrics with human interpretability judgments and downstream task performance consistently across multiple domains. Specifically, capturing human interpretability judgments requires a carefully designed user-study protocol with sufficiently diverse participant representation and clear criteria to quantify interpretability gains attributable to the visual word-cloud augmentations. The plan currently lacks detailed design of these user studies—such as participant selection, annotation protocols, statistical power analysis, and qualitative versus quantitative assessment frameworks—that are essential to credibly claim improvements in interpretability over existing intrinsic metrics alone. Furthermore, the experimental plan depends heavily on the assumption that the earth mover’s distance embeddings from word-clouds will provide stable numerical signals correlated with semantic inconsistencies. Given this novel metric’s untested nature, early pilot experiments with robust statistical analysis and potential fallback strategies should be more explicitly integrated into the plan to mitigate the risk of negative or inconclusive results. Lastly, the corpus collection and domain selection should be justified with explicit criteria to ensure real-world relevance and practical evaluation. Addressing these practicability and design specifics will increase confidence in the feasibility and scientific soundness of the experiment plan, solidify conclusions on interpretability impact, and avoid typical pitfalls that often downgrade review and acceptance prospects in competitive conferences."

          "feedback_content": "To significantly enhance the idea’s impact and novelty—beyond the current novel but competitive combination of word-cloud visualizations and intrinsic evaluation metrics—the proposal could integrate concepts from 'vision-language models' and 'narrative visualization.' Specifically, leveraging state-of-the-art vision-language pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP or similar architectures) to generate more semantically grounded embeddings for word-cloud elements would enrich the semantic fidelity of divergence metrics. Additionally, advancing from static word clouds to interactive, narrative-driven multi-modal visualizations could enable users to explore semantic drift or hallucination patterns with contextual explanations dynamically. Incorporating such advanced visual grounding would broaden the scope from solely intrinsic numeric evaluation into intelligent, human-centered interpretability tools that combine linguistic, visual, and possibly temporal dimensions, addressing concerns about narrow impact scope. Furthermore, embedding this approach into downstream applications such as electronic health records summarization or intelligent decision-making pipelines can demonstrate end-to-end applicability with measurable real-world influence. This integration aligns the idea with cutting-edge multi-modal fusion trends, boosting its competitiveness and appeal in top-tier venues, while fostering collaborative expansions with related research communities in vision-language understanding and interactive AI systems."
