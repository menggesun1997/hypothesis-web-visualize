        "title": "Multimodal Temporal Probing Framework for Clinical Video-Language Comprehension in Real-Time Decision Support LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current intrinsic evaluation techniques for clinical Large Language Models (LLMs) inadequately incorporate temporal video modalities critical to capturing evolving patient states and procedural contexts, leading to incomplete assessment of LLM comprehension and reasoning in real-time clinical workflows.",
        "Motivation": "While multimodal machine learning has advanced video-language modeling, there remains a critical gap in applying rigorous, interpretable intrinsic probing methods tailored to clinical video-language data for LLMs. By designing a multimodal temporal probing framework that quantitatively and intrinsically evaluates LLMs’ understanding of clinical procedure dynamics—beyond surface pattern recognition—this work extends biomedical health informatics and intelligent decision-making toward robust, temporally-aware clinical AI systems. Our approach uniquely integrates convolutional neural networks extracting structured visual embeddings from procedure videos with synchronized clinical notes, enabling fine-grained intrinsic measures of context retention and temporal alignment, thus surpassing existing static or loosely coupled benchmarks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-component intrinsic probing framework that decomposes clinical video-language understanding into interpretable sub-tasks executed within a structured multi-task probing architecture. Specifically: 1) Employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pre-trained on medical video datasets (e.g., endoscopy/surgery) to generate spatiotemporal embeddings capturing procedural dynamics. 2) Extract timestamp-aligned text embeddings from real-time clinical notes using domain-adapted LLM encoders. 3) Construct intrinsic probes comprising learnable classifiers and regression heads trained on controlled, clinically-validated alignment tasks (e.g., step classification, temporal order prediction, clinically-relevant event detection) to quantitatively assess LLM internal representations’ fidelity to multimodal temporal semantics. 4) Introduce novel temporal congruency metrics that reflect both video-language synchronization and the LLM’s reasoning on evolving patient states, including Dynamic Context Retention Score (DCRS) measuring consistency of internal states across time. 5) Integrate multi-task losses balancing probe accuracy on visual, textual, and joint tasks, facilitating disentanglement of genuine comprehension from superficial pattern matching. 6) Provide interpretable probe outputs enabling clinically meaningful evaluation and error analysis. This design ensures soundness and reproducibility by grounding probe tasks in medical image analysis literature and multimodal learning theory.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Acquisition: Partner with clinical institutions and utilize public datasets (e.g., Cholec80, EndoVis) augmented with timestamped annotations and synthesized clinical notes aligned to video timestamps, ensuring patient privacy compliance. 2) Data Preprocessing: Establish standardized pipelines for video frame extraction, CNN feature generation, and clinical text embedding; develop semi-supervised alignment methods leveraging weak supervision to handle imperfect synchronization. 3) Pilot Study: Develop pilot intrinsic probes on a subset of synchronized data to validate temporal congruency metrics and probe architectures. 4) Full-scale Experiment: Train the multi-task probes on the curated datasets, iteratively tuning for robustness to noisy synchronization. 5) Evaluation: Compare LLMs fine-tuned for clinical decision support tasks against baseline static text-only probes, examining DCRS and task-specific probing metrics. 6) Scaling: Experiment with data augmentation methods and weak supervision to enhance probe generalization to broader clinical video sets. 7) Analysis: Conduct interpretability and ablation studies to elucidate contributions of video, language, and temporal alignment components. Each step incorporates risk mitigation including synthetic data creation and fallback proxies for missing video-text alignment.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A video segment of a laparoscopic surgical step with synchronized surgeon notes indicating procedural actions and patient vitals; Probe task: Temporal order classification to confirm the LLM representation's grasp of correct procedural sequence. Expected Output: High intrinsic probe accuracy indicating LLM internal state accurately reflects evolving clinical context and video dynamics rather than mere pattern correlations. Additional case: Detection of clinically meaningful events (e.g., bleeding onset) reflected jointly in video frames and textual notes, with the probe producing interpretable confidence scores demonstrating context retention.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "In the event of limited availability of highly synchronized clinical video-text data, the approach will pivot to leveraging semi-supervised alignment via weakly aligned multimodal datasets, employing domain adaptation to transfer learned probe representations. Alternatively, synthesized clinical notes generated through medical text augmentation aligned with available video segments will be utilized to bootstrap probe training. The probing framework’s modular design allows substitution of the CNN visual encoder with gait recognition or brain-computer interface inspired temporal encoders to improve robustness, while approximate temporal matching proxies and video procedural step classification tasks remain as lower-fidelity intrinsic assessments. These strategies ensure progressive scalability and resilience against data scarcity and synchronization noise."

However, the mechanism by which these probes quantitatively measure 'comprehension' and 'context retention' intrinsic to LLMs is not sufficiently detailed. It is unclear how intrinsic probing will differentiate between mere pattern matching and genuine temporal understanding or how multi-task probing frameworks will be architected to handle complex clinical semantics alongside video dynamics. Providing a clearer model design or algorithmic framework for probe construction and evaluation is essential for soundness and reproducibility. Clarification on the specific metrics and their interpretability vis-à-vis LLM reasoning would strengthen this section significantly. This will help ensure the method is not only conceptually appealing but technically rigorous and well-founded in methodology literature, particularly given the known challenges in video-language alignment within clinical domains."

The plan should address the feasibility challenges regarding data procurement channels, annotation consistency, and the synchronization pipeline implementation. Furthermore, defining fallback strategies appears reactive; a more proactive, scalable approach to handle incomplete or noisy synchronization data (e.g., semi-supervised or weakly supervised methods) would strengthen the experimental robustness. Detailing concrete criteria for dataset selection, initial pilot studies to validate probe feasibility, and contingency plans for scaling beyond limited datasets would improve experimental planning soundness."
