    "title": "Bias-Resilient Federated Probing Framework for Healthcare LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Healthcare LLMs often encode demographic and social biases, risking unfair medical decision support. Existing intrinsic benchmarking misses integrated bias assessment within privacy-preserving distributed training contexts, limiting trustworthy deployment.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gaps of bias mitigation under-exploration and external gaps of untapped federated learning/privacy needs by proposing a bias-aware intrinsic benchmarking protocol embedded into federated healthcare model training, ensuring privacy and fairness evaluation simultaneously.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a federated intrinsic benchmarking protocol combining bias probes (e.g., sensitive attribute perturbations, fairness metrics), privacy-preserving techniques like secure aggregation and differential privacy. Integrate bias-evaluation tasks into federated rounds, producing aggregated, bias-aware intrinsic scores without exposing patient data.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Use federated medical datasets across simulated hospitals (e.g., MIMIC, eICU). 2) Employ GPT variants or healthcare-specific LLMs in federated setup. 3) Implement intrinsic probes measuring demographic bias (gender, race) in language understanding tasks. 4) Evaluate bias scores, utility, and privacy trade-offs. 5) Baselines: centralized bias auditing, blind federated learning. 6) Metrics: fairness (equalized odds, demographic parity), intrinsic understanding scores, privacy leakage metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical discharge notes mentioning patient demographics; Expected Output: Intrinsic probe flags minimal biased association between demographics and diagnoses, with privacy parameters indicating no data leakage, demonstrating bias-resilient federated benchmarking.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated bias evaluation yields noisy signals, pursue local bias audits with synthetic proxy data sharing or simulate gradient inversion attacks to validate privacy robustness separately."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an integration of federated learning, intrinsic bias probing, and privacy-preserving techniques, but lacks detailed explanation of how these components will interface technically during training rounds. For example, how bias probes will be computed and aggregated securely without leaking sensitive data is not clearly specified. Consider clarifying the mechanism for: (1) embedding bias probes within federated rounds, (2) communication protocols for bias-related metrics, and (3) how differential privacy parameters balance bias detection sensitivity versus privacy leakage. Adding pseudocode or a workflow diagram could enhance clarity and demonstrate soundness of the approach's internal logic and feasibility under real-world resource constraints. This is critical because improper integration risks either privacy breaches or ineffective bias measurement, undermining both core goals of the framework. Addressing this would improve confidence in the method's soundness and practical applicability under healthcare data constraints, which is essential for trustworthy deployment in sensitive domains like medicine. Targeting the Proposed_Method section will maximize impact on internal coherence and validity of the idea."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and the global concepts such as AI safety, GDPR, and deployment of AI systems, a concrete way to enhance impact and novelty is to explicitly incorporate compliance verification with region-specific privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) into the federated probing framework. This could involve devising audit trails or formal guarantees linking the bias-resilient benchmarking outputs to legal privacy requirements, thereby positioning the method as not only a technical contribution but also an operational compliance tool. Furthermore, expanding the framework to support continual monitoring in deployed healthcare AI systems, integrating risk assessment for sensitive information leakage during user interactions, would broaden applicability and emphasize AI safety and robustness aspects. This integration could differentiate the proposal by showcasing practical readiness for regulatory and deployment challenges in healthcare AI, beyond academic benchmarking settings. Aligning with these globally linked concepts can substantially elevate the workâ€™s significance and reception in premier AI/ML venues."
