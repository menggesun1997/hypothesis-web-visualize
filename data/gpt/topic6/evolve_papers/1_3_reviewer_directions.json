    "title": "Cross-Modal Word-Cloud Augmented Intrinsic Evaluation for LLM Interpretability",
    "Problem_Statement": "Intrinsic evaluation frameworks miss opportunities to leverage visual summaries like word clouds to enhance interpretability and fine-grained semantic assessment of LLM outputs.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external critical gap regarding integration of word-cloud visualizations with intrinsic evaluations, enabling richer, interpretable multi-dimensional insights into model behavior beyond scalar metrics.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a pipeline that generates dynamic word-cloud visualizations from LLM outputs and reference corpora, capturing term frequency and semantic salience. Combine these visual summaries with numeric intrinsic metrics (perplexity, self-consistency) to create hybrid evaluation reports. Novel metrics quantify divergence in word-cloud embeddings using earth mover's distance, correlating with semantic drift or hallucinations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets with reference text and LLM outputs across multiple domains. 2) Generate word clouds and convert to vector representations using semantic embeddings. 3) Compute standard intrinsic metrics and the proposed word-cloud divergence metric. 4) Analyze correlations with human interpretability judgments and downstream task performance. 5) Perform user studies assessing interpretability improvements.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM generates a medical summary. Output: Word-cloud divergence metric reveals missing or extra terms compared to reference, visually shown through overlapping word clouds, aiding identification of semantic inconsistencies despite acceptable perplexity scores.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If word-cloud vectors poorly capture semantic differences, explore alternate visualization embeddings like TF-IDF weighted embeddings or hierarchical topic models for richer representation."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method hinges on generating and comparing word-cloud visualizations converted into vector embeddings to detect semantic divergence. However, the mechanism by which word clouds—which traditionally emphasize frequency—can reliably capture semantic nuances, especially in the presence of polysemy or contextual shifts, is not fully clarified. The method also needs clearer justification on why earth mover's distance on these embeddings robustly correlates with semantic drift or hallucinations, considering the high dimensionality and noise inherent in word representations. To strengthen soundness, the authors should explicate the embedding extraction process, the dimensionality reduction (if any), and provide preliminary evidence or theoretical rationale supporting the fidelity of this approach to capture meaningful semantic differences beyond surface term frequency changes, ensuring the method is not merely a repackaging of superficial lexical overlap metrics rather than genuine semantic evaluation tools. This clarity is essential so reviewers and downstream users can trust that the method quantifies meaningful interpretability signals rather than artefacts of visualization or embedding choices, thus ensuring the pipeline’s core assumptions and mechanisms are well supported and reproducible in practice, not solely theoretically motivated or heuristic-based. Targeted ablation or validation studies on embedding robustness should be planned early on to mitigate foundational risks up front rather than post-hoc fallbacks, reinforcing the pipeline’s soundness and interpretability claims cohesively and transparently within the Proposed_Method section.  This will facilitate adoption and meaningful critique in this competitive paradigm, where incremental marker innovations rarely suffice alone without rigorous grounding of newly proposed interpretability metrics and visualization integration techniques. The method’s novelty and impact hinge on this firm underlying mechanism clarity and empirical validation of claimed semantic insights extracted from such word-cloud augmented hybrid metrics, requiring more detailed articulation now to mitigate skepticism about effective semantic granularity capture capabilities inherent in the approach’s core design choices and selected distance metric applications on visualized data embeddings in NLP intrinsic evaluation pipelines for LLMs today and in near-future practical use cases such as medical summarization or other high-stakes domain applications described in the test cases. \"Is the semantic drift truly captured or only noisy lexical overlap?\" remains a key risk to be addressed explicitly in the revised proposal to ensure soundness at the core methodological level prior to experimental efforts having meaningful interpretability value potential later on across domains and user communities as claimed by the idea's motivation and scope of impact statements. Such clarifications will also help differentiate the approach concretely from competitive baseline or existing visualization plus metric combination approaches dominating the field today, emphasizing sound methodological rigor and validity for a stronger review outcome and adoption likelihood from the community perspective within premiere venues such as ACL or NeurIPS."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is generally well structured, but critical feasibility issues arise in aligning the proposed word-cloud divergence metrics with human interpretability judgments and downstream task performance consistently across multiple domains. Specifically, capturing human interpretability judgments requires a carefully designed user-study protocol with sufficiently diverse participant representation and clear criteria to quantify interpretability gains attributable to the visual word-cloud augmentations. The plan currently lacks detailed design of these user studies—such as participant selection, annotation protocols, statistical power analysis, and qualitative versus quantitative assessment frameworks—that are essential to credibly claim improvements in interpretability over existing intrinsic metrics alone. Furthermore, the experimental plan depends heavily on the assumption that the earth mover’s distance embeddings from word-clouds will provide stable numerical signals correlated with semantic inconsistencies. Given this novel metric’s untested nature, early pilot experiments with robust statistical analysis and potential fallback strategies should be more explicitly integrated into the plan to mitigate the risk of negative or inconclusive results. Lastly, the corpus collection and domain selection should be justified with explicit criteria to ensure real-world relevance and practical evaluation. Addressing these practicability and design specifics will increase confidence in the feasibility and scientific soundness of the experiment plan, solidify conclusions on interpretability impact, and avoid typical pitfalls that often downgrade review and acceptance prospects in competitive conferences."

          "feedback_content": "To significantly enhance the idea’s impact and novelty—beyond the current novel but competitive combination of word-cloud visualizations and intrinsic evaluation metrics—the proposal could integrate concepts from 'vision-language models' and 'narrative visualization.' Specifically, leveraging state-of-the-art vision-language pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP or similar architectures) to generate more semantically grounded embeddings for word-cloud elements would enrich the semantic fidelity of divergence metrics. Additionally, advancing from static word clouds to interactive, narrative-driven multi-modal visualizations could enable users to explore semantic drift or hallucination patterns with contextual explanations dynamically. Incorporating such advanced visual grounding would broaden the scope from solely intrinsic numeric evaluation into intelligent, human-centered interpretability tools that combine linguistic, visual, and possibly temporal dimensions, addressing concerns about narrow impact scope. Furthermore, embedding this approach into downstream applications such as electronic health records summarization or intelligent decision-making pipelines can demonstrate end-to-end applicability with measurable real-world influence. This integration aligns the idea with cutting-edge multi-modal fusion trends, boosting its competitiveness and appeal in top-tier venues, while fostering collaborative expansions with related research communities in vision-language understanding and interactive AI systems."
