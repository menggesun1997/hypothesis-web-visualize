    "Problem_Statement": "Interpretability of intrinsic benchmarks in healthcare LLMs is limited, making it difficult to trust and act on bias or comprehension scores.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gaps of interpretability by integrating counterfactual text generation into intrinsic benchmarking to reveal model reasoning boundaries and bias sources, advancing transparent intrinsic evaluation frameworks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop intrinsic probes that generate counterfactual clinical statements modifying key demographic or clinical attributes, measuring LLM sensitivity to these changes and deriving explainability reports detailing model biases and failure modes intrinsically.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Identify clinical variables for counterfactual modification (e.g., ethnicity, gender). 2) Generate counterfactual texts and input to LLMs. 3) Measure output variability and intrinsic probing scores. 4) Correlate counterfactual impact with bias indices. 5) Evaluate explainability through user studies involving clinicians.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Original clinical note versus a counterfactual with changed patient gender; Expected Output: Intrinsic probe highlights degrees of output change, flagging possible gender bias with interpretable explanations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If counterfactual generation yields low-quality texts, integrate expert-in-the-loop rephrasing or leverage pretrained controlled text generation models for precise counterfactuals."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that intrinsic benchmarks' interpretability can be significantly enhanced through counterfactual clinical text generation needs stronger justification or preliminary evidence. Clinical texts are highly complex and nuanced; changing demographic or clinical attributes might not always isolate bias or reasoning failures cleanly, especially since multiple confounding factors often intertwine in real data. Clarify how counterfactual generation will reliably disentangle these influences to provide trustworthy explainability rather than introducing spurious correlations or artifacts. Explicitly address potential assumptions on causal validity of counterfactuals within clinical contexts to strengthen soundness of this key premise. This is critical in healthcare settings where stakes of incorrect bias attribution are high, so assumptions here must be rigorously grounded and critically discussed within Proposed_Method and Problem_Statement sections to avoid conceptual fragility and promote model interpretability credibility and robustness. Consider adding a dedicated theoretical discussion or validation step early in the work to vet this assumption rigorously before downstream experiments proceed in Experiment_Plan section to build strong foundation for subsequent claims and analyses.  \n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is generally clear but lacks concrete methodological details that ensure feasibility and scientific rigor. For example, the counterfactual generation step needs elaboration on how to guarantee clinical plausibility and linguistic coherence of generated texts, beyond fallback plans involving experts or pretrained controlled models. Specify metrics and validation protocols for these aspects, such as human annotation guidelines, quality benchmarks, or automated evaluation methods. Further, correlation of output variability with bias indices requires careful statistical modeling and definition of bias indices tailored to clinical contexts; the plan should mention control for confounders or confirm robustness to sample heterogeneity. The proposed user studies with clinicians are crucial but need details on evaluation criteria and sample size considerations to ensure meaningful assessment of explainability. Overall, strengthen the experimental plan with more operational details, validation checkpoints, and risk mitigation strategies to enhance practical feasibility. Clarifying these points will increase confidence that the experimental workflow can deliver interpretable, clinically relevant insights within reasonable resource constraints. \n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty classification as NOV-COMPETITIVE, to enhance impact and distinctiveness, consider integrating vision-language models or gaze data such as eye-tracking information from clinicians reviewing clinical texts. This multimodal extension could ground the counterfactual probing in human cognitive attention patterns, providing richer explainability insights and aligning AI biases with human expert reasoning. Incorporating biomedical and health informatics pipelines to leverage eye gaze data or intelligent decision-making frameworks could deepen interpretability and trustworthiness. Additionally, exploring application in mental health settings with professional users can broaden societal impact and open new collaborative research avenues. Embedding these globally linked concepts can differentiate the work by connecting state-of-the-art modalities and user-centric evaluation, thus boosting novelty and practical relevance for downstream clinical adoption. Suggest explicitly outlining such extensions as future work or optional modules in Proposed_Method or Motivation to signal innovation pathways to reviewers and stakeholders alike.\n\nTarget Section: Motivation"
