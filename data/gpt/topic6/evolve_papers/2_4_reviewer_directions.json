    "title": "Probabilistic Masked Autoencoder Ensemble for Non-IID Embedding Reliability",
    "Problem_Statement": "Embedding reliability in non-IID distributed data environments remains elusive because current models do not quantify uncertainty or aggregate diverse model perspectives effectively.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to the internal gap about heterogeneous data handling and uncertainty quantification by introducing an ensemble framework combining probabilistic masked autoencoders to robustly characterize embedding spaces, enabling confidence-aware deployment across domains.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an ensemble system of probabilistic masked autoencoders trained on diverse data partitions representing heterogeneity. Individual MAEs output embeddings with uncertainty scores; ensemble aggregation via Bayesian model averaging yields consolidated embedding distributions. Embedding quality is assessed using predictive uncertainty and embedding variance metrics. The method supports domain adaptation through uncertainty-guided reweighting and active sample selection to improve ensemble robustness under shifting data distributions.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Use simulated non-IID datasets from healthcare and cybersecurity domains. 2) Train multiple probabilistic MAEs on data shards. 3) Aggregate embedding outputs and uncertainties. 4) Evaluate embedding quality via reconstruction error, uncertainty calibration, and downstream task accuracy. 5) Benchmark against single-model baselines and deterministic MAEs. 6) Analyze robustness under domain shifts and adversarial perturbations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Distributed medical sensor readings with variable noise profiles per sensor. Output: Ensemble embedding with uncertainty bounds indicating confidence intervals for downstream anomaly detection.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If ensemble complexity is prohibitive, reduce number of MAEs or use dropout as approximate ensemble. Alternatively, switch to simpler uncertainty proxies like entropy of embedding activations or hinge on contrastive learning uncertainty estimates."

          "feedback_content": "While the idea of probabilistic masked autoencoder (MAE) ensembles for embedding reliability is promising, the proposal lacks clarity on how uncertainty estimates from individual MAEs are aggregated via Bayesian model averaging in practice. The methodology would benefit greatly from a more detailed explanation or formalization of the ensemble aggregation process, including how posterior distributions from heterogeneous models are combined and how this impacts embedding consistency and uncertainty calibration. Clarifying these mechanisms will strengthen soundness and reproducibility of the approach, as current descriptions risk being perceived as conceptual rather than concretely actionable techniques applicable to embedding spaces under non-IID settings. Consider including mathematical formulations or pseudocode to elucidate this core mechanism thoroughly in the revision to avoid ambiguity and strengthen reviewers’ confidence in the proposed method’s validity and innovation potential within this competitive space. This is crucial since uncertainty quantification aggregation is a non-trivial problem especially when models are diverse and trained on heterogeneous shards, demanding precise methodological treatment to avoid naive averaging that could misrepresent uncertainties or embeddings themselves. Addressing this would enhance the core soundness of the method significantly and put the idea on stronger theoretical footing to stand out amid related work in ensembles and probabilistic embeddings for non-IID data domains. This improvement is prioritized ahead of augmenting experimental breadth, as the latter depends heavily on a well-defined core mechanism blueprint first to be credible and feasible for downstream evaluation and impact realization phases as planned in the experiment section."

          "feedback_content": "To enhance novelty and broader impact given the NOV-COMPETITIVE assessment, integrate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques focused on interpretability of uncertainties in embeddings produced by the ensemble. Specifically, augment the ensemble framework with post-hoc interpretability modules that can attribute uncertainty sources either to input feature heterogeneity, model confidence variability, or domain shifts. This synergy taps into the globally-linked concept of Explainable AI and human-computer interaction by making the uncertainty outputs actionable and trustworthy for end users. Such integration could involve visual analytics or attribution methods that expose the confidence drivers behind embedding reliability assessments, critically aiding deployment decisions in sensitive domains like healthcare or cybersecurity. By connecting probabilistic embeddings with explainability, the work transcends mere uncertainty quantification to offer transparent, human-interpretable signals crucial for real-world adoption. This addition would significantly differentiate the work in a crowded research landscape, appeal to a broader scientific community, and increase practical impact beyond pure embedding reliability research towards responsible AI applications."
