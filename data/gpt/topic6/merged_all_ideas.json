        "Problem_Statement": "Current federated learning frameworks for large language models (LLMs) in healthcare suffer from insufficient mechanistic integration of bias mitigation, privacy preservation, and cognitive security assessments. Existing benchmarks lack iterative, multi-dimensional feedback systems to precisely detect, quantify, and actively mitigate bias and adversarial threats during federated training, limiting trustworthiness and fairness in sensitive medical contexts.",
        "Motivation": "While federated learning frameworks have addressed data privacy in healthcare LLM training, the novel integration of intrinsic bias benchmarking with adaptive federated optimization is still nascent and typically lacks mechanistic transparency. Additionally, cognitive security risks—such as bias-driven adversarial manipulation—and privacy leakage challenges remain under-addressed. This research advances beyond conventional bias mitigation by embedding precise mathematical formulations of intrinsic bias probes, feedback-control mechanisms for adaptive client re-weighting, and incorporating threat modeling and privacy risk evaluation within federated updates. By introducing agent-to-agent communication for secure and fairness-aware client coordination, this approach establishes a multi-dimensional, tightly coupled framework that significantly elevates scientific novelty and practical impact in healthcare LLM fairness and security.",
        "Proposed_Method": "1) Develop a suite of intrinsic bias probes formalized as differentiable functions evaluating demographic fairness (e.g., disparity in prediction confidence across protected groups) on clients' local validation datasets after each federated training epoch. Each probe produces quantitative bias metrics (B_i) defined as statistical distance measures (e.g., Wasserstein distance) on output distributions stratified by sensitive attributes. 2) Implement a feedback controller that computes adaptive client update weights (w_i) based on bias metrics, privacy risk scores, and cognitive security threat levels (T_i) detected via an embedded adversarial pattern recognizer analyzing model update divergence and semantic interoperability anomalies. The weight update rule is: w_i(t+1) = w_i(t) * exp(- α * (B_i + β * P_i + γ * T_i)), where α, β, γ are tunable hyperparameters balancing bias, privacy, and security risks. 3) Integrate agent-to-agent secure multiparty communication protocols enabling clients to share aggregated, privacy-preserving bias and threat signals, enhancing robustness against malicious updates. 4) Fuse these metrics and weights within the federated aggregation step using a weighted Federated Averaging algorithm, dynamically mitigating bias while preserving privacy and countering adversarial threats. 5) The entire system implements privacy guarantees via differential privacy noise calibrated to budget constraints, ensuring formal risk bounding without sacrificing the adaptive feedback loop's efficiency.",

Expected Output: Progressive reduction of intrinsic bias probe scores (e.g., statistical parity difference approaching zero), maintained or improved clinical text understanding performance (e.g., stable BLEU/ROUGE-L scores), demonstrably low privacy leakage risk per formal measurements, and detection plus mitigation of adversarial influences reflected in stable model convergence and secured coercion resistance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive client re-weighting destabilizes training convergence or introduces excessive communication burden, fallback to a hybrid strategy incorporating: (a) post-hoc fairness correction layers applied centrally using federated summary statistics; (b) client-specific fairness regularizers implemented as constrained optimization subproblems externally from intrinsic probes; and (c) simplified cognitive security anomaly detectors operating offline to vet client updates prior to aggregation. These measures ensure continued bias and adversarial mitigation while maintaining privacy and utility until more sophisticated tightly integrated control can be reintroduced."

We propose to bridge this gap by integrating graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent anatomical and spatial relationships derived from depth and segmentation data. This structured multimodal probing approach leverages relational inductive biases for enhanced grounding, interpretability, and intrinsic evaluation of LLMs, thereby advancing beyond conventional fusion methods and addressing the novelty challenge by introducing graph-based intrinsic evaluation paradigms in clinical LLM benchmarks.",

(2) We construct anatomical spatial graphs where nodes correspond to these landmarks and edges represent spatial proximities or physiological connections, encoding graph features with a graph neural network (GNN) (e.g., graph convolutional networks or graph attention networks) to capture relational spatial context. (3) Concurrently, we encode corresponding clinical text into LLM embeddings (assuming access to intermediate embeddings or representations from pre-trained clinical LLMs). (4) We design multimodal intrinsic probes that fuse the GNN-processed graph embeddings with language embeddings via cross-modal embedding alignment mechanisms, such as trainable projection heads and similarity scoring functions (e.g., cosine similarity or learned metric functions), enabling rigorous quantification of spatial-semantic alignment within LLM representations. (5) The alignment measurement is formalized as a correlation alignment score that captures how well LLM embeddings semantically ground spatial graph representations. We assume access to synchronized video frames and corresponding clinical text notes to construct these multimodal probes, and that intermediate LLM embedding layers can be accessed for probe insertion. This mechanistic integration ensures reproducibility and evaluation rigor through clearly defined embedding extraction, graph construction, GNN encoding, and similarity scoring pipelines.",

Moreover, we explicitly connect intrinsic features to downstream clinical language processing tasks, thus enhancing the method's practical relevance. Incorporation of natural language processing advances ensures alignment with state-of-the-art language understanding paradigms.",

The core idea is to interpret segment boundaries (e.g., symptom or treatment spans) as structured cues supervising probing classifiers that predict intrinsic token-level and span-level features within pretrained LLMs. \n\nThe probe architecture consists of a token-level segmentation head combined with span-level binary classifiers over entity candidates, jointly optimized. Meta-learning (model-agnostic meta-learning, MAML) trains probe parameters to rapidly adapt to new clinical subdomains using very few annotated examples, enhancing domain generalization.\n\nComplementing this, we employ contrastive learning on the probe’s intermediate representations, using positive pairs from semantically related segments (e.g., same entity type) and negative pairs from unrelated segments or other texts. This learns robust, discriminative intrinsic feature spaces reflective of clinical language semantics captured by the LLM.\n\nThe overall training proceeds in two phases: (1) meta-training on base clinical datasets with segmentation labels to learn adaptable probe initializations and contrastive embedding spaces, and (2) rapid adaptation (few-shot fine-tuning) on novel clinical subdomains for intrinsic evaluation.\n\nAn illustrative schematic depicts input clinical text with segmented entity boundaries feeding into the probing architecture, showing token-classification (segmentation) and contrastive embedding modules, culminating in intrinsic feature extraction. This framework ensures interpretable intrinsic features aligned with downstream clinical language processing tasks such as named entity recognition or symptom extraction.\n\nIntegration with natural language processing techniques, including BIO-tagging inspired token labeling and span representation methods, grounds the approach in established clinical NLP conventions, enhancing interpretability and relevance.",

This research uniquely advances the intrinsic evaluation landscape by developing a rigorously interpretable, multimodal fusion approach that integrates heterogeneous data sources, enhancing evaluation fidelity and bridging computational metrics with responsible AI concerns in natural language processing.

Feature extraction includes standardized normalization, temporal alignment by timestamp, and semantic alignment using ontologies such as the WHO Quality of Life framework and geographical metadata linking. We utilize a hierarchical late fusion architecture: initially, modality-specific feature embeddings are generated — perplexity is normalized and scaled; social indicators undergo dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA or autoencoders) and bias-mitigated transformation; then, these embeddings feed into a transparent, interpretable neural fusion model based on attention mechanisms (e.g., multimodal Transformer encoders) to learn cross-modal interactions. The model is trained via supervised regression to predict human expert assessment scores using a labeled dataset of text samples paired with corresponding social indicators. Interpretability is ensured by incorporating attention visualization and feature importance scoring, enabling auditability of which modalities and features drive the final composite score. Prior work such as \"Late Fusion Models in Multimodal Healthcare Informatics\" guides architectural choices, ensuring feasibility and domain alignment.

By embedding an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to calibrate discourse move weights through expert consensus, the method departs from static weighting schemes, adapting dynamically to varied social support contexts.

To determine optimal weights for these discourse moves, we implement the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), systematically eliciting and aggregating expert judgements to generate a principled weighting scheme reflecting the relative importance of each discourse move in social support contexts. The discourse tagger itself leverages multi-task learning incorporating data from social support forums, educational dialogues, and misinformation detection datasets to enhance robustness and cross-domain generalizability, including multilingual settings. Finally, the adjusted perplexity score is calculated by integrating the weighted token-level perplexities, yielding a metric that better correlates with human judgments of social support quality and discourse appropriateness.

Unlike simpler sentiment or thematic weighting methods, our method emphasizes discourse moves as key predictors of performance expectancy and technological acceptance in digital health settings. This novel, socially-informed evaluation bridges computational linguistics and health informatics, enhancing understanding and measurement of LLM social impact, with explicit consideration of variations across communities and contexts.

Then, cross-domain alignment is achieved via a learnable nonlinear transformation neural network, designed as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) mapping source domain embeddings into the target embedding space. The transformation parameters are optimized with a composite loss function comprising (1) a semantic consistency loss, defined as a metric learning objective minimizing the cosine distance between aligned entity pairs, and (2) a graph structure preservation loss, preserving local neighborhood relationships captured by KGE embeddings. Iterative refinement alternates between (a) updating transformation networks to minimize loss, and (b) re-evaluating semantic drift using a domain-invariant measure based on centered kernel alignment (CKA), ensuring convergence without overfitting to specific ontology pairs. Semantic drift is quantified by fluctuations in CKA scores between iterations, triggering an early stopping criterion.

While biological dose-response modeling offers a conceptual analogy, fundamental differences between chemical toxicity affecting physiological systems and semantic variations in LLM outputs—often subjective and context-dependent—challenge the direct transposition of such principles. This creates a gap in establishing sound, mechanistic evaluation methods that rigorously define and quantify thresholds of behavioral deviation under increasing perturbation intensities, accounting for model stochasticity and semantic complexity. Addressing this gap requires a robust theoretical framework that reconciles dose-response modeling with semantic behavioral metrics and integrates human-computer interaction standards to enable reproducible, meaningful risk threshold assessments.",

With the surge of AI applications in critical domains like healthcare innovation and intelligent computing, robust, standardized intrinsic evaluation techniques are imperative for AI trustworthiness and deployment decisions.

By leveraging recent advances in heterogeneous graph neural networks and graph transformers, the proposed method aims to achieve superior integrative evaluation performance that is rigorously domain- and modality-agnostic, establishing new standards for unified intrinsic model evaluation across complex biological and behavioral data.",

Edges encode diverse relationships, including: temporal transitions quantitatively represented via learned transition probabilities or cross-correlation metrics; biological similarity through domain-specific distance functions; and predicted functional dependencies. Edge types are explicitly labeled to preserve relation semantics. Domain-specific biases are mitigated by normalizing feature distributions via modality-aligned preprocessing pipelines and adversarial domain adaptation losses incorporated during multi-modal graph neural network training. The architecture employs a hybrid of heterogeneous graph transformers and relational graph convolutional networks enabling disentanglement of modality-specific signals and integration of cross-domain shared features. Attention mechanisms within the transformer layers dynamically weight domain-specific and cross-domain relational signals, quantitatively balancing integration and disentanglement. The resulting shared latent representations serve as intrinsic consistency and robustness embeddings, which are mapped to unified, quantitative evaluation metrics through task-specific downstream predictors.
