    "Problem_Statement": "Users often lack understanding of ethical norms underpinning social media moderation, leading to repeated violations and negative experiences, unaddressed by current AI frameworks.",
    "Motivation": "Innovates by integrating educational ethics and psychological behavior change frameworks into AI moderation, promoting user self-regulation and ethical awareness, closing gaps between user experience and ethical codes.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a behavioral coaching chatbot embedded in social media platforms that proactively engages users caught in moderation cycles, providing personalized ethics education, feedback, and risk mitigation strategies to encourage compliance and reduce negative impacts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop chatbot dialogue systems based on educational ethics curricula and behavioral psychology. 2. Pilot with users flagged multiple times for content violations. 3. Measure changes in violation frequency, user stress, and perception of fairness over time.",

        "title": "Personality and Moral Self-Regulation Adaptive Coaching Chatbot for Ethical AI Moderation Compliance",
        "Problem_Statement": "Users on social media platforms frequently violate content moderation policies due to limited understanding of underlying ethical principles and cognitive rationalizations such as moral disengagement. Current AI moderation systems address violations reactively but lack proactive, personalized mechanisms to foster long-term ethical awareness and self-regulation, resulting in repeated violations, user frustration, and disengagement.",
        "Motivation": "While AI moderation is widespread, existing solutions insufficiently integrate theoretical behavioral frameworks and fail to engage users in sustained ethical learning. This research innovates by combining educational ethics, behavioral psychology, and moral self-regulatory theories with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to design an adaptive, context-sensitive coaching chatbot. By addressing users' moral disengagement and leveraging constructs such as perceived usefulness and ease of use, our system aims for higher engagement and measurable behavior change, filling a critical gap in ethically-aligned AI moderation user support and advancing beyond prior work in automated moderation assistance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose developing an AI-driven behavioral coaching chatbot embedded within social media platforms that adaptively personalizes ethics education and feedback based on user profiles, violation contexts, and individual moral self-regulatory processes. The chatbot architecture includes: 1) a modular dialogue manager integrating an educational ethics curriculum co-designed with domain experts; 2) a behavioral psychology and moral disengagement module that identifies rationalizations behind infractions and dynamically adjusts messages to counteract them; 3) user modeling leveraging psychometric inputs, violation history, and real-time interaction data to tailor interventions; and 4) integration of TAM constructs by monitoring and optimizing perceived usefulness and ease of use through feedback-driven dialogue modifications. Ethical storytelling is operationalized via concise, relatable vignettes embedded naturally in conversations, validated for engagement to mitigate automation bias or lecture fatigue. The system continuously collects interaction patterns for ongoing adaptation to enhance user acceptance and compliance. This multi-layered personalization aims to transform user attitudes and behaviors proactively while maintaining conversational authenticity and trust.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Design and develop the chatbot system including ethics curriculum, moral disengagement countermeasures, and TAM-based engagement optimization. 2. Conduct formative user studies to refine dialogue strategies and storytelling elements ensuring naturalness and avoiding disengagement. 3. Implement a randomized controlled trial (RCT) recruiting users flagged for repeated content violations; randomly assign to chatbot intervention or control (no chatbot) groups. 4. Collect quantitative data on violation frequency over 6 months, chatbot usage patterns, and engagement metrics. 5. Measure psychological constructs including user stress (using the Perceived Stress Scale), perception of fairness (using validated fairness perception scales), moral self-regulation (using existing inventories), and chatbot acceptance (using TAM questionnaires). 6. Perform longitudinal analysis to assess sustained behavior change and engagement. 7. Ensure ethical compliance with informed consent, privacy safeguards, and oversee participant well-being throughout trials. 8. Analyze mechanisms of behavior change via structural equation modeling integrating moral self-regulation and TAM factors.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user previously flagged three times for violating hate speech policies receives a chatbot prompt shortly after a recent infraction. The chatbot personalizes a message containing a brief story illustrating the societal impact of respectful discourse, counters the user's justification of their behavior identified as moral disengagement, and offers alternative phrasing suggestions along with motivational feedback emphasizing ease of response and relevance. Expected Output: Over successive interactions, a statistically significant reduction in policy violations is observed compared to controls, increased moral self-regulatory scores, and higher chatbot acceptance reported. These improvements align with decreased user stress and more favorable fairness perceptions towards moderation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If initial chatbot engagement is insufficient, implement incentive mechanisms grounded in TAM constructs such as social recognition badges enhancing perceived usefulness and ease of use. Additionally, explore peer-support integration to leverage online community influence on moral self-regulation. Should personalization models not yield expected behavioral shifts, revert to simplified tailored messaging focusing on highest-impact ethical concepts combined with opt-in user controls to increase trust and voluntary participation."

The mechanism through which personalized ethics education and feedback translate into measurable behavior change in the wild is under-specified. Strengthen this section by detailing the dialogue system architecture, personalization strategies, and how the chatbot adapts to diverse user profiles and violation contexts to ensure meaningful and contextually appropriate coaching interactions that can realistically influence user compliance and sentiment. Also consider how ethical storytelling will be operationalized within chatbot dialogues without risking user disengagement or skepticism due to perceived lecturing or automation bias. This will enhance the conceptual soundness and practical validity of the approach, beyond a high-level abstract description, making it more compelling and actionable for implementation and evaluation purposes (Proposed_Method)."

Currently, it does not specify details on experimental design aspects such as control groups or randomization to properly attribute observed changes to the chatbot intervention. Furthermore, key metrics such as 'user stress' and 'perception of fairness' appear subjective and require validated measurement instruments and sampling strategies. Include plans for data collection on chatbot usage patterns, longitudinal follow-up to assess sustained behavior change, and powering of the study with adequate participant numbers. Also address potential ethical considerations, privacy issues, and user consent in deploying a behavioral coaching chatbot in real social media contexts. By strengthening the experimental design and measurement plan, the research will be better positioned to yield scientifically valid and interpretable results that confirm feasibility and impact claims (Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)."

Specifically, frame chatbot adoption and sustained engagement through perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use constructs, and model how users' moral self-regulatory processes influence their responsiveness to behavioral coaching. Incorporate randomized controlled trials to rigorously assess the causal effects of the intervention on violation frequency and ethical awareness. Further, leveraging insights from moral disengagement literature could inform the personalization of coaching messages to counter rationalizations for misconduct. Embedding these globally-linked concepts will provide a stronger theoretical foundation, improve user acceptance, and better position the system for broader impact and competitive differentiation (Globally-Linked Concepts)."
