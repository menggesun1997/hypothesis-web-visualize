        "title": "Privacy-Enhanced Cross-Organizational Data Sharing Protocols Leveraging Hybrid Cloud-Edge Cryptography, Differential Privacy, and Trusted Execution for Scalable LLM Collaboration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Cross-organizational collaboration on training large language models (LLMs) using sensitive financial data faces significant privacy, security, and regulatory challenges. Current protocols leveraging attribute-based encryption (ABE) and multi-party computation (MPC) suffer from scalability limitations in diverse and heterogeneous cloud-edge environments, lack robust probabilistic privacy guarantees, and do not fully address practical enforceability and auditability under real-world network conditions and multi-institutional deployments.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work explores cryptographic methods for secure collaborative AI, the novelty is limited by a lack of holistic integration of scalable privacy-enhancing technologies and practical trust mechanisms in hybrid cloud-edge systems tailored for financial institutions. This proposal advances the state-of-the-art by embedding complementary differential privacy techniques, deploying trusted execution environments (TEEs) on edge nodes, and leveraging blockchain-based decentralized identity and audit trail systems. These innovations collectively enable fine-grained, probabilistically rigorous, and efficiently verifiable privacy-preserving data sharing and collaborative LLM training that meets stringent regulatory compliance across heterogeneous institutional scales and network environments.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel hybrid protocol combining attribute-based encryption (ABE) and secure multi-party computation (MPC) optimized for hybrid cloud-edge infrastructures, augmented with differential privacy mechanisms to provide formal privacy guarantees beyond cryptography alone. Trusted execution environments (TEEs) deployed at edge nodes will facilitate efficient and secure local computations with reduced cryptographic overhead. To ensure robust compliance and auditability, integrate a blockchain-based decentralized identity management and immutable logging system for fine-grained access controls, policy enforcement, and transparent audit trails. The approach supports scalable, heterogeneous organizational participation and heterogeneous network conditions through adaptive protocol parameterization and stress-resilient communication strategies.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement the integrated ABE-MPC-differential privacy protocol incorporating TEE support on an extensible cloud-edge testbed mimicking multi-institution financial organizational structures. 2) Conduct scalability studies by varying the number and size of participating organizations, including small, medium, and large financial entities, and diverse edge device capabilities. 3) Perform stress tests simulating heterogeneous, adverse network conditions including variable latency, bandwidth constraints, and intermittent connectivity. 4) Benchmark key metrics such as privacy leakage (formal differential privacy guarantees plus cryptanalysis), computational overhead, communication volume, latency impact, and throughput compared against baseline federated learning and standard encrypted federated learning approaches without TEEs or privacy enhancements. 5) Evaluate regulatory compliance enforcement effectiveness through blockchain-based audit trail verifications and policy adherence mechanisms in collaboration with domain compliance experts. 6) Conduct ablation studies to isolate contributions of differential privacy, TEEs, and blockchain components.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Encrypted and differentially privatized transactional datasets from three banks of varying sizes and edge device capabilities, each enforcing distinct data sharing policies aligned with GDPR and financial regulations. Output: A collaboratively trained LLM model aggregated without access to raw or deanonymized data, with preserved utility and bounded privacy loss; cryptographically and probabilistically validated privacy guarantees; latency and throughput performance data under fluctuating network conditions; comprehensive access logs and immutable blockchain audit records demonstrating policy enforcement and compliance with external audit acceptance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the integrated cryptographic and privacy-preserving mechanisms introduce prohibitive computational or latency overheads in real-world heterogeneous deployments, explore a modular fallback approach where heuristic policy enforcement and differential privacy are primarily applied at the application layer, combined with enhanced blockchain-based delegation and audit mechanisms. Additionally, investigate selective use of TEEs only on higher-capacity edge nodes and adaptive adjustment of privacy parameters to balance utility and efficiency while maintaining regulatory compliance guarantees."

Additionally, metrics like computational and communication costs should be benchmarked against realistic multi-institutional deployments, not just controlled simulations, to properly assess feasibility. Consider enriching the experimentation by including stress tests under varying network conditions and quantifying latency impacts to ensure practical applicability in real-world heterogeneous cloud-edge infrastructures. Also, clarify the method for enforcement and validation of regulatory compliance within experiments to strengthen validity of compliance claims and auditability evaluations in financial contexts. This enhancement will increase the robustness and real-world relevance of the feasibility evaluation in the experiment plan section, making it more scientifically sound and practical for deployment scenarios relevant to your problem statement and proposed method."

This could provide probabilistic privacy guarantees alongside cryptographic protections. Additionally, incorporating trusted execution environments (TEEs) at edge nodes could strengthen security guarantees without disproportionately increasing cryptographic overhead. Exploring blockchain-based identity or audit trail systems may further reinforce compliance and auditability in complex cross-organization settings. Embedding these globally linked concepts would make your approach more comprehensive and distinct, addressing both cryptographic scalability and practical trust in hybrid cloud-edge systems for sensitive financial data sharing and collaborative LLM training."
