    "title": "Psychological Ethics Embedded Fairness Metrics for Moderation Evaluation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Standard AI fairness metrics overlook psychological and educational ethics perspectives, limiting holistic evaluation of LLM-driven moderation fairness.",
    "Motivation": "Innovates by developing composite fairness metrics grounded in psychological ethics constructs such as perceived autonomy, respect, and risk framing, addressing internal gaps in current evaluation standards.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design and validate new fairness metrics incorporating user-reported psychological assessments combined with quantitative AI moderation outcomes. Use these metrics to benchmark existing and new moderation systems for a richer fairness profile.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop psychological survey instruments inspired by education and biomedical ethics. 2. Collect linked user feedback and moderation decisions data. 3. Compute composite fairness indices integrating quantitative and qualitative components. 4. Correlate these new metrics with user retention and trust data.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Moderation outcomes on a user cohort. Expected Output: Composite fairness score revealing gaps invisible to standard statistical metrics, guiding system improvement.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If composite metrics are too complex or inconsistent, develop modular sub-metrics focusing on psychological or ethical dimensions separately for phased adoption."
