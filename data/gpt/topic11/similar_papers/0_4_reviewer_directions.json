    "title": "Healthcare System-Aware Domain Disentanglement for Fairness Robustness under Data Heterogeneity",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing domain adversarial approaches insufficiently leverage healthcare system operational characteristics when disentangling domain-specific bias features, reducing fairness robustness against heterogeneous and evolving clinical data sources.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the overlooked intersection between domain adversarial networks and healthcare system knowledge frameworks, innovating in the way domain disentanglement incorporates explicit system-level contextual features to improve bias mitigation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a domain disentanglement network that jointly encodes patient features and healthcare system metrics (e.g., resource availability, institutional protocols), learning bias-invariant representations shaped by system-aware constraints. This approach prevents confounding between clinical features and systemic biases, enabling more reliable fairness across institutions and time.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather multisite datasets with linked healthcare system metadata. 2) Build a disentanglement model with dual encoders for patient and system context data along with domain adversarial training. 3) Compare to classic disentanglement ignoring system features regarding fairness and diagnostic accuracy. 4) Evaluate in domain shift scenarios reflecting hospital workflow changes and resource fluctuations. 5) Perform feature importance analyses to interpret model behavior.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient demographics and clinical tests from hospitals with varying ICU bed availability. Expected Output: Disease prediction results invariant to institutional resource disparities, reflected in reduced disparity metrics across hospitals.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If healthcare system features are sparse or inconsistent, fallback to proxy system context variables such as temporal indicators or care level tags. Explore transfer learning approaches to leverage knowledge from well-characterized institutions."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while conceptually comprehensive, lacks critical detail on the exact nature and availability of healthcare system metadata and how it will be standardized across multisite datasets. The plan should clarify strategies for handling heterogeneity and missingness in system-level features, particularly since such data often vary widely across institutions and time. Additionally, more specifics on evaluation metrics for fairness and diagnostic accuracy under domain shifts would strengthen experiment feasibility and reproducibility. Detailed protocols for data preprocessing, domain adversarial training stability, and validation setups are needed to confirm the experimental approach is practical and scientifically rigorous in real-world healthcare contexts, where data complexity and bias are challenging to model reliably. Targeted improvements here will prevent potential roadblocks in implementation and validation phases, ensuring the methodology's assumptions hold true in heterogeneous clinical environments and guaranteeing meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the experiments."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the presence of well-established domain adversarial and fairness literature, incorporating the globally-linked concept of 'contrastive self-supervised learning' could notably boost the impact and distinctiveness of this work. Specifically, integrating contrastive self-supervised objectives alongside the dual encoders for patient and system context data could more robustly separate invariant and variant features across domains without heavy reliance on labeled data. This hybrid approach might enhance bias disentanglement and improve the learned representations' generalization and robustness to unseen hospital workflows or resource fluctuations. Moreover, coupling this with state-of-the-art deep learning models validated on fairness benchmarks can position this work as not only healthcare-system aware but also leveraging cutting-edge representation learning innovations, broadening its relevance beyond a narrow clinical audience to the wider machine learning and fairness research communities."
