    "title": "Ethical Psychological Profiling for Personalized AI Moderation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM-driven moderation systems lack personalization that accounts for users' psychological and ethical predispositions, leading to stress and negative experiences due to uniform moderation policies.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of lacking integration between individual user experience and ethical codes by embedding psychological ethics principles into moderation design, thus bridging micro-level concerns and macro-level ethical frameworks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive moderation framework that profiles users' ethical and psychological traits via anonymized questionnaires and behavioral analysis, using this profile to inform AI moderation decisions with tailored transparency and feedback. It leverages psychological ethics to create dynamic ethical frames guiding moderation strictness and communication style per user.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets combining social media interaction logs and voluntary psychological assessments. 2. Train LLM moderation models augmented with user ethical profiles. 3. Benchmark against generic moderation models on stress indicators, complaint rates, perceived fairness scales. 4. Use ablation studies to assess impact of ethical profiling. 5. Conduct user studies measuring trust and comfort.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user with high risk-aversion and ethical values around fairness posts borderline content. Expected Output: AI moderation provides a transparent, rationale-based warning with opportunities for educational dialog tailored to user's profile, reducing negative stress and increasing trust.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If profiling fails to improve outcomes, fallback to clustering users by interaction patterns alone without psychological input. Conduct detailed error analysis to refine profiling questionnaires or integrate more subtle implicit behavior signals."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that psychological and ethical profiling can be reliably and ethically performed via anonymized questionnaires and behavioral analysis needs stronger justification and grounding. Psychological traits and ethical predispositions are complex, context-dependent, and may not be stable enough to guide AI moderation effectively without introducing bias or privacy concerns. Clarify how you will ensure robust, valid, and ethically sound profiling, especially considering variability across cultural and situational contexts, and potential user resistance to profiling for moderation purposes. Inclusion of privacy-enhancing technologies and clear informed consent protocols should be elaborated to support this assumption validly within the method section and ethical considerations framework. This is critical to avoid harm from mischaracterization or profiling errors, which could worsen user experience and trust rather than improve it. Consider grounding the profiling approach in existing validated psychological instruments and ethical profiling literature to reinforce this assumption's soundness and ethical feasibility in real-world deployment contexts, given the sensitive nature of personalized moderation systems and user autonomy concerns. Without this, the foundational premise risks being unrealistic or ethically problematic, undermining the entire framework's effectiveness and acceptance within diverse user populations and platforms at scale. Addressing this assumption thoroughly will strengthen the credibility and trustworthiness of the proposed approach and help anticipate implementation challenges early on in your design and evaluation stages, making the research more robust and impactful overall.  \n\nSuggested Action: Add detailed discussion of ethical, cultural, and privacy considerations of profiling in Proposed_Method, and justify psychological assessment methods with recent high-quality literature to bolster validity and address ethical risk upfront. Conduct proactive engagement with ethical AI guidelines and possibly experts during approach refinement and user study design phases, ensuring these assumptions are critically examined and transparently communicated in the final methodology and user interaction design phases to build trust and efficacy in real deployment scenarios with diverse global users. This will also prepare you well to address peer reviewer concerns on ethical soundness and user data sensitivity in top-tier venues like ACL or NeurIPS. This critique must be addressed before proceeding further with implementation or experiments to avoid foundational methodological flaws and ethical risks that compromise soundness and feasibility simultaneously, as these are intertwined in this domain and setup.  \n\nIn sum, re-examine and elaborate the feasibility and validity of psychological and ethical profiling assumptions underpinning your moderation personalization approach for soundness, ethics, user acceptance, and bias mitigation upfront in your proposal and experiments plan to ensure real-world impact and integrity of your system.  \n\n\n---\n\n[SOU-ASSUMPTION] must be remedied as top priority for this work's success and acceptance at a premier venue requiring rigorous, ethically responsible AI research outcomes in sensitive, user-centric environments like content moderation mediated by LLMs and user psychology integration. This fundamental feedback is essential and non-negotiable for method sanity and eventual system trustworthiness and fairness evaluations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
