    "title": "Cross-Organizational Data Sharing Protocols Using Hybrid Cloud-Edge Cryptography for LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Effective cross-organizational sharing of sensitive financial data for collaborative LLM training is hindered by privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions, with existing protocols lacking scalable cryptographic guarantees across hybrid cloud-edge environments.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal limitations of securing collaborative AI platforms and the external hidden bridge linking collaborative platforms and cloud-edge computing with cryptographic methods to enable privacy-preserving data sharing at scale for financial LLMs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Propose a hybrid cryptographic protocol combining attribute-based encryption (ABE) with secure multi-party computation (MPC) optimized for cloud-edge architectures. The protocol supports fine-grained access control policies tailored to regulatory requirements, enabling institutions to share encrypted data snippets and model updates selectively while maintaining auditability and compliance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop implementation of the ABE-MPC hybrid protocol. 2) Simulate cross-organization LLM training with private financial datasets on cloud-edge testbeds. 3) Baselines: existing federated learning with or without standard encryption. 4) Metrics: privacy leakage, computational/communication cost, compliance with GDPR and financial regulations, and model performance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Sample input: Encrypted transactional datasets from three banks with different data sharing policies. Expected output: Aggregated model trained without exposing raw data, with access logs confirming regulatory compliance and enforceable data sharing constraints.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If computational overhead is excessive, explore simplified cryptographic schemes or heuristic policy enforcement at the application layer with stronger audit trails."

          "feedback_content": "While the experiment plan outlines key steps such as implementing the ABE-MPC hybrid protocol and simulating LLM training on cloud-edge testbeds, it lacks specific details about scalability testing across diverse organizational sizes and heterogeneous edge environments. Additionally, metrics like computational and communication costs should be benchmarked against realistic multi-institutional deployments, not just controlled simulations, to properly assess feasibility. Consider enriching the experimentation by including stress tests under varying network conditions and quantifying latency impacts to ensure practical applicability in real-world heterogeneous cloud-edge infrastructures. Also, clarify the method for enforcement and validation of regulatory compliance within experiments to strengthen validity of compliance claims and auditability evaluations in financial contexts. This enhancement will increase the robustness and real-world relevance of the feasibility evaluation in the experiment plan section, making it more scientifically sound and practical for deployment scenarios relevant to your problem statement and proposed method."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty is rated as NOV-COMPETITIVE in a vibrant research niche, you could substantially enhance impact and novelty by integrating privacy-enhancing technologies such as differential privacy mechanisms within your ABE-MPC hybrid protocol. This could provide probabilistic privacy guarantees alongside cryptographic protections. Additionally, incorporating trusted execution environments (TEEs) at edge nodes could strengthen security guarantees without disproportionately increasing cryptographic overhead. Exploring blockchain-based identity or audit trail systems may further reinforce compliance and auditability in complex cross-organization settings. Embedding these globally linked concepts would make your approach more comprehensive and distinct, addressing both cryptographic scalability and practical trust in hybrid cloud-edge systems for sensitive financial data sharing and collaborative LLM training."
