    "title": "Few-shot Explainable Legal Reasoning via Siamese-Enhanced LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Legal text analysis often suffers from scarce annotated data and opaque model decisions, limiting trust and applicability in real-world scenarios.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gaps of dataset scarcity and limited explainability in LLMs by integrating few-shot learning with Siamese networks, leveraging the hidden bridge between similarity learning and low-data environments specific to legal texts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid framework combining a transformer-based LLM fine-tuned with a Siamese network for similarity learning, enabling few-shot adaptation to new legal cases. Alongside, implement an explainability module that uses attention-based alignment and case similarity visualization to justify decisions.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate a legal dataset with few-shot annotated subsets.\n2) Implement baseline LLM models (e.g., GPT) and Siamese architectures.\n3) Train the hybrid few-shot model and generate explanations.\n4) Evaluate on metrics like accuracy, F1, and explanation faithfulness.\n5) Conduct user studies with legal experts assessing trustworthiness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A new contract clause regarding data privacy.\nOutput: The model identifies relevant precedents with similarity scores and highlights key phrases influencing its reasoning, mapping them to legal concepts.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If few-shot learning fails, explore data augmentation with synthetic legal text generation. If explanations lack clarity, integrate counterfactual explanation techniques for better interpretability."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-MECHANISM",
          "feedback_content": "The core mechanism combining a transformer-based LLM fine-tuned with a Siamese network for few-shot legal reasoning needs clearer elaboration. Specifically, how the Siamese network integrates with the LLM embeddings and how the joint training or inference proceeds must be described in more detail to ensure the approach is sound and reproducible. Clarify whether the Siamese network operates at a token, sentence, or case level and how it interacts with attention-based explainability to justify decisions coherently. This clarity is essential for assessing the soundness of the proposed hybrid model and its explainability claims effectively within legal domain constraints, where interpretability is critical for trust and adoption. Please provide architectural diagrams, training objectives, and sample inference workflows in the next iteration of the proposal to solidify conceptual soundness and reproducibility within the competitive landscape noted in novelty assessment (NOV-COMPETITIVE). This will help reviewers and potential users understand the innovative integration and technical novelty clearly, beyond just combining known components superficially or sequentially without joint optimization or synergy. Without this, the core innovation and potential advantages remain underspecified and vulnerable to critiques about incremental contribution and limited practical soundness, risking rejection despite the motive and problem relevance. A more rigorous mechanism description will also strengthen feasibility and trustworthiness of the experiments and impact claims downstream in the proposal pipeline, notably the explanations' faithfulness and human user studies with legal experts, which depend heavily on how explanations are derived from the model's internal representations and similarity scores. Overall, this should be the immediate focus before proceeding with extensive experiments or expansion of scope or impact claims, to ensure the idea is built on a distinctly defined, viable foundation rather than an ill-clarified combination of components with unclear integration strategies or interpretability guarantees. This critical step will maximize the proposal's chance of acceptance and future adoption in real-world legal NLP applications, which are sensitive to reasoning transparency and technical rigor above all.—Target: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The current experiment plan requires expansion and greater specificity to ensure feasibility and rigor. It lacks critical details on dataset construction, including the size and sources of the 'few-shot annotated subsets' and how the legal dataset covers a sufficiently diverse range of cases to validate generalization claims. Precise information and justification are needed on how baseline models such as GPT or other LLMs will be adapted or fine-tuned in this legal context, benchmarking protocols, and hyperparameter optimization strategies. The plan should also clarify how explanation faithfulness will be quantified, e.g., which metrics or validation protocols will measure the accuracy or reliability of attention-based alignments and case similarity visualizations. Furthermore, the design and methodology of the user studies with legal experts must be detailed, including participant selection criteria, study tasks, evaluation questionnaires, and statistical analysis approaches to assess trustworthiness meaningfully. Without these specifications, it is challenging to determine if the experiments are practical, scientifically valid, and capable of demonstrating benefits convincingly. Providing more granularity and contingency plans for challenges during dataset curation, model training, and human evaluations will solidify the feasibility and reduce risks of inconclusive results or operational bottlenecks. In addition, the fallback plans outlined (synthetic data augmentation and counterfactual explanations) should be integrated more proactively into the experiment pipeline rather than only as fail-safes, possibly as ablation studies or complementary analyses. Addressing these feasibility points in the proposal's next iteration is critical for demonstrating sound experimental design and increasing confidence in reproducibility and practical impact beyond preliminary novelty screening.—Target: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
