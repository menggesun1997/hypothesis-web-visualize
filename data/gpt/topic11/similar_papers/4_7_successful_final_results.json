        "title": "Dynamic Risk Mitigation Behavior Modeling to Enhance AI Moderation Feedback with Mental Health-Aware Personalization",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current AI moderation systems do not effectively model or incentivize users' adaptive risk mitigation behaviors post-moderation, limiting their ability to promote sustained ethical posting. Additionally, these systems neglect the mental health impact of moderation feedback, often overlooking user stress and trust dynamics that influence long-term behavior change.",
        "Motivation": "This work aims to close critical gaps in AI moderation by precisely modeling nuanced user adaptations following moderation actions and integrating these insights into feedback loops that dynamically personalize guidance. By incorporating measurable mental health outcomes such as stress and trust, grounded in cognitive load theory and human-computer interaction principles, the approach broadens impact to foster not just compliance but also user well-being and sustained ethical engagement on digital platforms.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a formalized computational framework that detects and models risk mitigation behaviors via multi-modal behavioral signals, including linguistic rephrasing patterns, posting frequency modulation, and temporal response dynamics extracted from user interaction logs. These features will be input into a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based model designed to capture temporal adaptation patterns. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent will leverage the RNN outputs to personalize moderation feedback, dynamically balancing tailored encouragement, transparency notices, and rewards to users. The RL policy will optimize for dual objectives: maximizing ethical compliance and minimizing adverse mental health impacts, using stress and trust proxies derived from behavioral and self-report data, thereby ensuring system stability and fairness. This design integrates adaptive learning system principles and human-computer interaction theories to create a feedback loop that is sensitive to cognitive load and mental health outcomes, making the system both user-centric and ethically robust.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect and annotate user interaction data post-moderation to identify and categorize risk mitigation behaviors such as content rephrasing, posting delays, and topic shifts. 2. Develop and train an RNN model to predict and continuously update risk mitigation behavior states using temporal behavioral features. 3. Design and implement a reinforcement learning framework that uses RNN predictions to dynamically personalize moderation feedback strategies, balancing ethical compliance incentives and user mental well-being metrics like stress indicators and trust scores. 4. Conduct a longitudinal user study on an active platform to evaluate changes in behavioral compliance, user-reported stress, trust levels, and cognitive load. 5. Analyze system performance regarding fairness, adaptability, and mental health integration, refining the RL reward functions and feedback mechanisms accordingly.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user repeatedly re-phrases borderline content across multiple posts within short intervals, exhibiting linguistic adaptation and posting frequency modulation. Expected Output: The system detects these risk mitigation behaviors through RNN temporal patterns and issues a tailored transparency notice praising ethical improvement while introducing supportive messages designed to reduce user stress, thus reinforcing trust and compliance. Feedback dynamically adapts if stress proxies rise, shifting towards empathetic guidance to maintain mental well-being.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should RNN modeling or reinforcement learning personalization face challenges such as insufficient data or unstable training, fallback will employ interpretable rule-based heuristics derived from initial user behavior surveys to detect risk mitigation attempts. Simultaneously, we will implement incremental data collection protocols and simpler adaptive filters to bootstrap the system, enabling gradual refinement towards the full adaptive RNN-RL framework."

Incorporating human-computer interaction principles and potentially leveraging adaptive learning system frameworks could deepen the personalization aspect. Such integration can position the work within broader AI system adaptation and human-robot interaction fields, making the idea both more interdisciplinary and impactful by addressing not just ethical posting but also user well-being and mental health, thus broadening the scope and relevance to real-world digital platform challenges."
