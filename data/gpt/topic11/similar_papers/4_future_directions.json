        "title": "Ethical Psychological Profiling for Personalized AI Moderation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM-driven moderation systems lack personalization that accounts for users' psychological and ethical predispositions, leading to stress and negative experiences due to uniform moderation policies.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of lacking integration between individual user experience and ethical codes by embedding psychological ethics principles into moderation design, thus bridging micro-level concerns and macro-level ethical frameworks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive moderation framework that profiles users' ethical and psychological traits via anonymized questionnaires and behavioral analysis, using this profile to inform AI moderation decisions with tailored transparency and feedback. It leverages psychological ethics to create dynamic ethical frames guiding moderation strictness and communication style per user.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets combining social media interaction logs and voluntary psychological assessments. 2. Train LLM moderation models augmented with user ethical profiles. 3. Benchmark against generic moderation models on stress indicators, complaint rates, perceived fairness scales. 4. Use ablation studies to assess impact of ethical profiling. 5. Conduct user studies measuring trust and comfort.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user with high risk-aversion and ethical values around fairness posts borderline content. Expected Output: AI moderation provides a transparent, rationale-based warning with opportunities for educational dialog tailored to user's profile, reducing negative stress and increasing trust.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If profiling fails to improve outcomes, fallback to clustering users by interaction patterns alone without psychological input. Conduct detailed error analysis to refine profiling questionnaires or integrate more subtle implicit behavior signals."

        "Proposed_Method": "Design an interactive transparency interface that educates users about moderation decisions through layered ethical narratives, case studies, and risk mitigation scenarios inspired by educational ethics curricula. The module adapts content based on user responses, promoting ethical literacy and reducing negative user reactions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop curriculum-based transparency content referencing real moderation cases. 2. Integrate into a moderation dashboard as an interactive module. 3. Pilot with social media users undergoing moderated content flags. 4. Measure changes in perceived fairness, trust, and knowledge retention versus standard opaque or static explanations. 5. Refine adaptivity rules based on feedback loops.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User receives notification with flagged content. Expected Output: Transparency module presents an explanation framed with ethical principles, invites user to view a short educational vignette, and offers suggestions for risk mitigation behaviors in future posts.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If users find the module too complex or avoid interaction, simplify content to bite-sized key points or integrate gamified ethical quizzes to boost engagement."

        "Proposed_Method": "Implement a real-time user stress detection system using physiological signals (e.g., heart rate via smart devices) or behavioral indicators (typing speed, language tone), triggering adaptive moderation interventions designed to reduce user stress ethically and fairly.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multimodal datasets linking physiological and behavioral stress markers to moderation interactions. 2. Build stress detection classifiers validated against user self-reports. 3. Integrate stress feedback loop into LLM moderation, enabling adaptive response strategies (e.g., soft warnings, delay in penalty). 4. Evaluate reductions in stress metrics and fairness perceptions versus static moderation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User exhibiting increased typing latency and stressed language after receiving multiple flags. Expected Output: Moderation system adjusts its enforcement to a gentler tone, offers additional explanations and suggests breaks to mitigate stress.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If physiological data is unavailable, rely solely on behavioral proxies or self-reporting prompts. Analyze which proxies most reliably correlate with stress for future enhancement."

        "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Ethical Frame Embedding in Moderation Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLM-driven moderation systems apply fairness and ethics as abstract constraints without operationalizing rich interdisciplinary ethical frames spanning psychology, education, and philosophy.",
        "Motivation": "Bridges the silo of AI fairness frameworks and interdisciplinary ethical knowledge, addressing the external hidden bridge gap by embedding comprehensive ethical frames directly into model parameters and decision logic.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a knowledge base of ethical concepts from education, psychology, and philosophy encoded as constraints and heuristics. Integrate these as trainable embeddings or prompts within LLM-based moderation models to guide content filtering decisions respecting nuanced ethical perspectives.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate and formalize cross-disciplinary ethics knowledge bases. 2. Convert ethical frames into embedding space or prompt templates. 3. Fine-tune existing moderation LLMs with these augmented inputs. 4. Evaluate on benchmarks for fairness, accountability, and nuanced ethical reasoning.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Content with conflicting ethical considerations (e.g., free speech vs. harm). Expected Output: Moderation reflects balanced decision-making informed by embedded ethical frames explaining rationale.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct embedding harms performance, modularize ethics knowledge as external interpretable decision aids layered onto model outputs."
