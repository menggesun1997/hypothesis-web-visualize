    "title": "Hybrid Federated LLM Training Leveraging Cloud-Edge Trust Zones",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current federated learning approaches for training LLMs in financial services face scalability and security challenges, especially when integrating edge devices and cloud infrastructures. The lack of scalable, privacy-preserving architectures that harmonize decentralized training with trusted execution environments limits real-world deployment.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient scalable privacy-preserving methods for large generative AI models (LLMs) and the external ‘hidden bridge’ between collaborative platforms, federated learning, and trusted execution environments in cloud-edge hybrid architectures, to enable secure, scalable LLM training in finance.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a hierarchical federated learning framework where financial institutions serve as edge nodes running LLM training inside trusted execution environments (TEEs). Aggregation servers in the cloud coordinate parameter updates securely. The method employs homomorphic encryption combined with TEE attestation for verification. Novel workload partition algorithms optimize model slicing between edge and cloud to reduce communication overhead while preserving privacy.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect financial text datasets across multiple institutions (synthetic and institutional datasets). 2) Implement LLM training with the proposed federated method using simulated cloud-edge environments with TEEs (e.g., Intel SGX). 3) Baselines: centralized training, standard federated learning without TEEs. 4) Metrics: model utility (accuracy, perplexity), privacy leakage (differential privacy metrics), scalability (training time, communication cost), and robustness to adversarial nodes. 5) Perform ablation on partitioning and encryption parameters.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Sample input: Financial transaction logs split across three edge nodes. Expected output: A jointly trained LLM model that accurately predicts fraudulent patterns without exposing raw data from any institution, verified through TEE attestations and encrypted communication.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If communication overhead is too high, test alternative lightweight encryption schemes or reduce model size with pruning. If TEEs limit scalability, explore software-based secure multiparty computation as a fallback."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an ambitious integration of hierarchical federated learning, TEEs, homomorphic encryption, and novel workload partitioning. However, the precise mechanism by which model slicing will be optimized for communication overhead versus privacy preservation is not sufficiently detailed. The interaction between TEE attestation and homomorphic encryption in a multi-institution setting needs clarification to establish how trust and verification will be maintained without introducing prohibitive latency or complexity. Addressing these clarifications will strengthen the soundness and technical clarity of the core framework, ensuring it is realistically implementable and that security guarantees hold under adversarial conditions prevalent in financial domains, where threat models can be complex and subtle. Specific algorithmic details or architectural diagrams could significantly improve understanding and confidence in the mechanism proposed. This is critical, given the integration of several advanced components with different security and computation trade-offs that must work harmoniously for real-world scalability and robustness to adversarial nodes to be credible and replicable in practice.  Please elaborate these mechanisms explicitly, possibly with pseudo-code or a formal description of the protocol steps involving TEEs, attestation, encryption, and workload partitioning within the federated learning framework.  This will also aid feasiblity assessments and downstream experimental designs, revealing potential system bottlenecks early on and guiding realistic parameter settings and fallback strategy development, which are currently only broadly sketched in the plan, rather than tightly linked to the core method design.

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty is deemed NOV-COMPETITIVE due to the highly active and linked research in federated learning combined with TEEs and cloud-edge architectures, the impact and novelty could be enhanced by more explicitly integrating blockchain-based identity or decentralized model training paradigms from the 'Globally-Linked Concepts'. Introducing blockchain-based identity management could strengthen decentralized trust and provenance of training updates further than TEE and homomorphic encryption alone, potentially offering an immutable audit trail for compliance and robust adversarial accountability, which is paramount for financial applications. Alternatively, exploring hybrid cryptographic protocols with software-based secure multiparty computation (as an advanced fallback) aligned with blockchain verification might offer a layered security paradigm that balances efficiency and robust decentralization. Such integration would not only broaden the scope by bridging trusted execution and decentralized verification paradigms but also position the work more distinctly relative to current state-of-the-art, potentially moving beyond incremental combination to foundational architectural innovation for financial federated LLM training. Please consider revisiting the design to explicitly incorporate these concepts with a plan or rationale for how blockchain or decentralized identity can complement TEE and federated learning, thereby boosting both novelty and real-world impact.
