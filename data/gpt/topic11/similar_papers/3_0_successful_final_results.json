    "title": "Unified Environmental Impact Assessment Framework for Edge AI Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current AI deployment on edge devices such as single-board computers optimizes for security and performance without explicitly accounting for environmental impact. This leads to hidden carbon footprints during both training and inference stages, obscuring sustainability evaluation.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical internal gap of lacking lifecycle and environmental impact metrics integrated into AI systems operating on constrained hardware. It also leverages the innovation opportunity to combine environmental impact assessments with existing security and performance metrics in AI deployment pipelines.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design and implement a standardized environmental impact assessment framework that plugs into existing AI development pipelines on embedded devices. The framework will extend model evaluation metrics (MSE/MAE) and security metrics (TLS/SSL) with carbon footprint estimates based on energy consumption data during training and inference, model size, and hardware utilization profiling. It will integrate lifecycle assessment methodologies to provide end-to-end sustainability evaluation and support decision making by developers.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets from IoT and industrial load forecasting benchmarks.\n2. Develop or adopt energy profiling tools for single-board computers.\n3. Implement environmental impact assessment module combining energy data with lifecycle assessment standards.\n4.

        "title": "Scalable Environmental Impact Assessment Framework for Edge AI in Smart City Mobile Edge Computing Infrastructures",
        "Problem_Statement": "Deploying AI models on edge devices within smart city environments often focuses on performance, security, and latency without explicit consideration of their environmental impacts across the entire lifecycle. This oversight leads to hidden and unquantified carbon footprints from training, inference, communication, and network infrastructure usage, particularly within mobile edge computing frameworks that aggregate diverse hardware. Existing approaches lack standardized, reproducible, and scalable methods to quantify and integrate sustainability metrics alongside security and performance in real-world, multi-device, and networked edge AI deployments.",
        "Motivation": "While prior works address isolated device-level environmental profiling, there is a critical need to advance towards a comprehensive, lifecycle-inclusive, and context-aware environmental impact assessment framework that aligns with scalable mobile edge computing and smart city solutions. Integrating sustainability with existing security protocols and performance metrics will fill a major gap in sustainably managing edge AI deployments at urban scale. By embedding environmental metrics into mobile edge computing infrastructures, this work introduces a novel, multidisciplinary framework that drives impactful AI system design decisions within next-generation wireless networks and intelligent urban environments, substantially enhancing adoption feasibility and practical relevance beyond competitive baseline tools.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose to design and implement a scalable, standardized framework that quantifies and integrates environmental impacts (energy consumption, carbon footprint) and security metrics (e.g., impact of TLS/SSL protocols) into AI model evaluation and deployment pipelines within mobile edge computing setups in smart cities. Key innovations include: (1) validation of energy profiling tools across heterogeneous single-board computers and networked edge devices, (2) rigorous mapping of lifecycle assessment (LCA) components—from model training, inference, communication, to hardware lifecycle phases—using established LCA standards (e.g., ISO 14040 series) enhanced by network digital twin simulations for aggregated multi-node energy optimization, (3) quantification of energy overhead introduced by security protocols to analyze trade-offs between security and sustainability, and (4) embedding the framework within realistic smart city AI applications such as traffic forecasting and distributed sensor networks operating over beyond-5G wireless networks. This approach leverages network digital twin techniques to simulate energy usage patterns and optimize system-wide sustainability while maintaining privacy and security compliance, thus substantially increasing novelty and deployment impact.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Pilot multi-hardware energy profiling validation: Deploy existing and adapted energy measurement tools on diverse edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi variants, NVIDIA Jetson, ARM-based boards) to collect ground-truth energy consumption data during AI workload execution; validate accuracy and reproducibility across device types and environmental conditions.\n2. Lifecycle assessment quantification: Adopt ISO 14040 LCA standards to define measurable parameters for each lifecycle stage (training, deployment, communication, hardware manufacture and disposal); develop methodology to map these parameters to collected energy profiling data.\n3. Develop network digital twin models representing aggregated edge device clusters and communication infrastructure within smart city contexts; simulate and optimize energy and carbon metrics across devices and network, integrating operational data.\n4. Measure and quantify the energy and latency overhead introduced by security protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) during model communication and data transmission; statistically analyze trade-offs between security levels and environmental footprint.\n5. Integrate the environmental impact assessment and security evaluation modules into AI deployment pipelines supporting mobile edge computing infrastructures.\n6. Deploy framework on real-world AI applications relevant to smart cities (e.g., traffic load forecasting, environmental sensor networks) over beyond-5G wireless testbeds or simulators; collect and analyze integrated metrics including MSE, MAE, energy consumption, carbon footprint, security overhead, and latency.\n7. Compare with baseline systems lacking sustainability integration to demonstrate performance, environmental, and security trade-offs.\n8. Validate fallback strategies (simulation, lookup tables) by cross-referencing with direct measurements to ensure credible approximations within operational constraints.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Training and inference of traffic forecasting deep learning model distributed across heterogeneous edge devices (Raspberry Pi 4, NVIDIA Jetson Nano) in a simulated smart city mobile edge computing network using beyond-5G connectivity.\nExpected Output: Comprehensive evaluation report detailing model accuracy (MSE/MAE), energy consumption profiles (per device and network segment in joules), estimated lifecycle carbon footprint (kg CO2e) validated via LCA mapping, energy overhead attributable to TLS/SSL-secured communication, and latency/security compliance metrics.\nFurther, network digital twin simulation outputs optimizing energy use and suggesting deployment configuration adjustments to reduce carbon footprint while maintaining security and performance standards.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct energy measurement on all edge devices is infeasible, employ calibrated hardware simulation and empirically validated lookup tables derived from initial multi-hardware pilot measurements to estimate energy consumption credibly across devices. For lifecycle assessment complexity, begin with the operational phase energy and carbon footprint only, integrating manufacturing and disposal phases incrementally. To address uncertainties in security protocol energy overhead, develop controlled experiments isolating its energy impact, or alternatively use published benchmarks calibrated against our setup. These fallback strategies will be rigorously validated against available direct measurements and simulation outputs to maintain framework accuracy and practical utility."

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan lacks clarity on how energy profiling tools will be validated for accuracy on diverse single-board computers beyond Raspberry Pi, and how lifecycle assessment integration will be quantitatively operationalized. It is important to explicitly define validation protocols for the energy measurement methodology, ensure reproducibility across hardware, and detail the lifecycle assessment standards adopted. Furthermore, integrating security metrics (TLS/SSL) with environmental metrics is outlined but not substantiated with an evaluation methodology that quantifies trade-offs or overhead comprehensively. Strengthening these aspects will make the experimental plan more scientifically robust and feasible for deployment in real-world AI edge scenarios, avoiding underestimating measurement or integration challenges that might impede the framework’s adoption or accuracy assessment at scale. Specifically, consider a pilot energy measurement validation phase with multi-hardware setups and a clear mapping of lifecycle assessment components to measurable system parameters from training to deployment stages. Also, outline methods to quantify the impact of security protocols on energy consumption and carbon footprint to validate the claim of combining sustainability with security metrics meaningfully in the pipeline integration step.  This will substantially increase confidence in the feasibility of the complete framework implementation and evaluation strategy as presented in the Experiment Plan section.  Targeted elaboration here would reduce risk of experimental failure or incompleteness before committing resources to full-scale implementation and evaluation cycles, aligning closely with the problem statement’s emphasis on end-to-end environmental impact transparency in edge AI systems.   Additionally, clarify how fallback plans such as simulation or lookup tables will be validated to ensure they provide credible approximations, so the framework remains practical even if direct measurements are constrained. This careful attention to experimental feasibility will greatly strengthen the work's foundation and credibility in the AI research community.  \n\n"

By demonstrating how the proposed framework can embed into mobile edge computing infrastructures that underpin smart city applications (e.g., traffic forecasting, distributed sensor networks), the work can address scalability and contextual dynamics of energy use and carbon footprint in urban AI systems. Coupling environmental metrics with data privacy/security protocols already prevalent in smart city data flows would also ground the research in a high-impact, multidisciplinary domain, increasing practical relevance and cross-community interest. Furthermore, incorporating network digital twin techniques could enhance the framework’s lifecycle assessment by simulating and optimizing energy usage patterns across aggregated edge devices, contributing to smarter sustainability-aware system design. This integration capitalizes on the global trend toward sustainable smart city development and next-generation wireless technologies (beyond-5G), providing a compelling scenario where edge AI sustainability metrics directly influence infrastructure decisions and policy. Such an extension would differentiate the contribution in a competitive research area by positioning it at the intersection of edge AI, sustainability, and intelligent urban environments—amplifying impact, usability, and novelty beyond a single-device carbon footprint measurement tool.
