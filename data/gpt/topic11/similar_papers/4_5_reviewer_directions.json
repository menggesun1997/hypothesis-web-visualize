    "title": "Adaptive Governance Model Combining Self-Regulation and Ethical Psychology",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current regulatory approaches to AI moderation are fragmented and lack integration with user-centered ethical psychology insights, causing governance inefficiencies and poor user alignment.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap by formulating a hybrid AI governance model blending organizational AI self-regulation with psychological frameworks for ethics and risk perception, enabling more effective and human-aligned oversight.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a multi-stakeholder governance architecture that incorporates psychological assessment tools to monitor user stress and ethical perceptions, feeding into adaptive corporate self-regulation policies co-designed with external regulators informed by educational ethics principles.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Design psychological survey instruments capturing user ethical sentiments and stress. 2. Pilot governance feedback loops in collaboration with AI companies and regulators. 3. Monitor changes in AI moderation fairness, accountability indices, and user trust metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Aggregate user data shows rising stress under certain policies. Expected Output: Governance mechanism dynamically adjusts moderation policies and transparency to mitigate negative outcomes.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-stakeholder coordination stalls, prototype governance simulation environments to refine adaptive policies before real-world deployment."
