    "title": "Dynamic Energy Budgets for Secure AI in IoT Sensor Networks",
    "Problem_Statement": "Currently, secure AI models deployed in sensor networks lack adaptive mechanisms to dynamically adjust their energy consumption based on environmental and operational constraints, leading to inefficient resource usage and environmental impact.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the internal gap by introducing energy adaptation within secure AI pipelines, synthesizing insights from security, performance, and sustainability domains, motivated by the absence of such dynamic controls identified in the research map.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an energy budget controller that monitors sensor node energy availability, workload, and security demands, dynamically tuning model complexity, cryptographic strength, and communication frequency to optimize environmental impact without compromising overall system integrity.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Model sensor network scenarios with variable energy supply.\n2. Implement energy budget and adaptive controls in AI and security stacks.\n3. Test on IoT datasets with anomaly detection tasks.\n4. Measure system stability, security violations, energy consumption, and carbon footprint.\n5. Compare against static parameter systems.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: IoT node under fluctuating battery states and data stream with security and inference demands.\nOutput: System dynamically scales model size and encryption levels to keep energy consumption within budgets, maintaining security and prediction quality with lower carbon emissions.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive algorithms yield instability, incorporate predictive models or thresholds to limit scaling extremes."
