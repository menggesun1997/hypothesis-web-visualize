          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method must clarify how model compression, quantization, and pruning specifically adapt to cryptographic operations and security monitoring agents without compromising security guarantees. Currently, the mechanism is described at a high level without detailing which cryptographic algorithm components can be compressed or pruned, and how this will maintain or formally prove security properties. A thorough analysis or framework describing these adaptations with security proof sketches or threat model considerations is needed to establish soundness and trustworthiness of the approach in security-critical edge IoT environments. This will also address concerns about potential risks raised in the fallback plan and provide clearer methodological rigor to the study design, beyond general efficiency claims from Green AI techniques applied to AI models alone. Please expand the mechanism's technical specifics and justification accordingly in Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan sections to strengthen core validity and confidence in the approach's security preservation alongside efficiency gains.  This focus is vital given the security-critical context and competitive domain complexity evidenced in the novelty assessment, ensuring soundness and comprehensibility to reviewers and implementers alike.  Recommendation includes early stage formal or empirical evaluation plans that directly measure security impact while applying compression methods, explicitly embedded in the experiment plan steps, to bridge existing gaps in methodology and expected outcomes."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "To enhance the research impact and competitive position beyond the current novelty level, the idea should consider integrating AI-based security frameworks and emerging IoT architectures, such as federated learning or fog computing. For instance, the proposal can leverage resource-efficient machine learning anomaly detectors or intrusion detection systems alongside compressed cryptographic protocols to form a multi-layered security approach tailored for edge IoT devices. Incorporating advances in 'intelligent cyber-physical systems' and 'mobile edge computing' can widen application scenarios and performance insights. Additionally, bridging with concepts like 'role-based access control' or 'privacy approaches' could augment the holistic security posture delivered by the optimized protocols. This integration would explicitly situate the work within state-of-the-art IoT networks and next-generation wireless communication technologies, linking sustainable AI practices to broader system-level improvements. Doing so will address the competitive landscape by emphasizing innovative cross-domain synergies, attract interest from both green AI and IoT security communities, and generate novel architectural recommendations and deployment guidelines with greater real-world significance and uptake potential."
