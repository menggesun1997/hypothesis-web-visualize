        "title": "Hybrid Federated LLM Training Leveraging Cloud-Edge Trust Zones",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current federated learning approaches for training LLMs in financial services face scalability and security challenges, especially when integrating edge devices and cloud infrastructures. The lack of scalable, privacy-preserving architectures that harmonize decentralized training with trusted execution environments limits real-world deployment.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient scalable privacy-preserving methods for large generative AI models (LLMs) and the external ‘hidden bridge’ between collaborative platforms, federated learning, and trusted execution environments in cloud-edge hybrid architectures, to enable secure, scalable LLM training in finance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a hierarchical federated learning framework where financial institutions serve as edge nodes running LLM training inside trusted execution environments (TEEs). Aggregation servers in the cloud coordinate parameter updates securely. The method employs homomorphic encryption combined with TEE attestation for verification. Novel workload partition algorithms optimize model slicing between edge and cloud to reduce communication overhead while preserving privacy.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect financial text datasets across multiple institutions (synthetic and institutional datasets). 2) Implement LLM training with the proposed federated method using simulated cloud-edge environments with TEEs (e.g., Intel SGX). 3) Baselines: centralized training, standard federated learning without TEEs. 4) Metrics: model utility (accuracy, perplexity), privacy leakage (differential privacy metrics), scalability (training time, communication cost), and robustness to adversarial nodes. 5) Perform ablation on partitioning and encryption parameters.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Sample input: Financial transaction logs split across three edge nodes. Expected output: A jointly trained LLM model that accurately predicts fraudulent patterns without exposing raw data from any institution, verified through TEE attestations and encrypted communication.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If communication overhead is too high, test alternative lightweight encryption schemes or reduce model size with pruning. If TEEs limit scalability, explore software-based secure multiparty computation as a fallback."

        "title": "Adaptive Legal Compliance Framework for Collaborative AI in Finance",
        "Problem_Statement": "AI-driven financial platforms struggle to simultaneously ensure transparency, fairness, and regulatory compliance in real-time collaborative environments, leading to risks of unfair contract terms and consumer rights violations.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap concerning underaddressed regulatory compliance complexities and leverages the external hidden bridge between collaborative platforms and application-level security via cross-entropy optimization and regulatory frameworks for adaptive legal compliance in finance AI platforms.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an AI-powered compliance engine integrating cross-entropy optimization with legal ontologies to dynamically monitor, detect, and correct potential unfair contract terms or regulatory infractions during AI-generated contract negotiation or financial advice. The framework continuously adapts its policies using reinforcement signals from regulatory changes and consumer feedback, embedding fairness constraints directly into model objectives.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build a dataset of annotated financial contracts with labels for fairness and compliance. 2) Implement a transformer-based contract analyzer integrated with a legal ontology knowledge base. 3) Train the model using cross-entropy optimization with fairness-aware loss functions and adapt via reinforcement learning. 4) Evaluate on unseen contracts and simulated negotiations. 5) Metrics: fairness scores, compliance accuracy, detection latency, and user trust evaluations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Sample input: A draft loan contract with ambiguous penalty charges. Expected output: Highlighting potentially unfair terms, suggesting compliant rephrasing that aligns with consumer protection laws, improving transparency for stakeholders.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If model convergence is slow, incorporate rule-based heuristics for initial filtering. If legal ontology coverage is insufficient, involve domain experts to enrich knowledge representations and retrain."

        "title": "Quantum-Secured Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intrusion Detection in LLM Deployments",
        "Problem_Statement": "Entrenching model security for LLM deployment in financial services is difficult due to evolving cyber threats and the need for dynamic real-time intrusion detection mechanisms that guarantee privacy and secure key exchanges.",
        "Motivation": "Fulfills the gap regarding real-time secure operations and model security by harnessing machine learning-driven security (deep reinforcement learning) combined with quantum key distribution to defend LLM environments dynamically against sophisticated intrusions.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a dynamic intrusion detection system for LLM deployment environments that uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents to learn adaptive defense strategies against attacks (e.g., data poisoning, adversarial queries). Integrate quantum key distribution (QKD) to secure communication channels and exchange of cryptographic keys, ensuring unbreakable encryption of model updates and telemetry, safeguarding from man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Simulate an LLM deployment environment with network traffic including benign and malicious patterns. 2) Implement DRL agents trained via policy gradient methods to detect and respond to anomalies. 3) Integrate a QKD emulator for secure key exchange between system components. 4) Baselines: static rule-based intrusion detection, DRL without QKD. 5) Metrics: detection accuracy, false positive rate, response latency, and communication security level.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Sample input: An adversary injecting subtle perturbations in query streams aiming to degrade model performance. Expected output: DRL agent detects anomaly pattern promptly, triggers defense protocols while QKD ensures secure communications remain uncompromised.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If quantum key distribution setup is not feasible, substitute with classical advanced encryption standards with post-quantum cryptographic primitives and evaluate performance impact."

        "Proposed_Method": "Propose a hybrid cryptographic protocol combining attribute-based encryption (ABE) with secure multi-party computation (MPC) optimized for cloud-edge architectures. The protocol supports fine-grained access control policies tailored to regulatory requirements, enabling institutions to share encrypted data snippets and model updates selectively while maintaining auditability and compliance.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop implementation of the ABE-MPC hybrid protocol. 2) Simulate cross-organization LLM training with private financial datasets on cloud-edge testbeds. 3) Baselines: existing federated learning with or without standard encryption. 4) Metrics: privacy leakage, computational/communication cost, compliance with GDPR and financial regulations, and model performance.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Sample input: Encrypted transactional datasets from three banks with different data sharing policies. Expected output: Aggregated model trained without exposing raw data, with access logs confirming regulatory compliance and enforceable data sharing constraints.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If computational overhead is excessive, explore simplified cryptographic schemes or heuristic policy enforcement at the application layer with stronger audit trails."

        "Test_Case_Examples": "Sample input: LLM-generated credit risk assessment for an individual. Expected output: Privacy-preserved risk score alongside a transparent explanation tied to specific financial indicators, logged securely for auditability.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If differential privacy impairs explanation quality, experiment with personalized privacy budgets or post-hoc explanation methods that separate private computation from explanation generation."
