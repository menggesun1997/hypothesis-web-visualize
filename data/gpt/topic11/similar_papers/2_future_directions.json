        "title": "Few-shot Explainable Legal Reasoning via Siamese-Enhanced LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Legal text analysis often suffers from scarce annotated data and opaque model decisions, limiting trust and applicability in real-world scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses internal gaps of dataset scarcity and limited explainability in LLMs by integrating few-shot learning with Siamese networks, leveraging the hidden bridge between similarity learning and low-data environments specific to legal texts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid framework combining a transformer-based LLM fine-tuned with a Siamese network for similarity learning, enabling few-shot adaptation to new legal cases. Alongside, implement an explainability module that uses attention-based alignment and case similarity visualization to justify decisions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate a legal dataset with few-shot annotated subsets.\n2) Implement baseline LLM models (e.g., GPT) and Siamese architectures.\n3) Train the hybrid few-shot model and generate explanations.\n4) Evaluate on metrics like accuracy, F1, and explanation faithfulness.\n5) Conduct user studies with legal experts assessing trustworthiness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A new contract clause regarding data privacy.\nOutput: The model identifies relevant precedents with similarity scores and highlights key phrases influencing its reasoning, mapping them to legal concepts.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If few-shot learning fails, explore data augmentation with synthetic legal text generation. If explanations lack clarity, integrate counterfactual explanation techniques for better interpretability."
