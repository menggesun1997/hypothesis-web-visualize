    "abstract": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have raised concerns about the ethical, moral, and legal safeguards. There is a pressing need to improve metrics for assessing security and privacy of AI systems and to manage AI technology in a more ethical manner. To address these challenges, an AI Trust Framework and Maturity Model is proposed to enhance trust in the design and management of AI systems. Trust in AI involves an agreed-upon understanding between humans and machines about system performance. The framework utilizes an \"entropy lens\" to root the study in information theory and enhance transparency and trust in \"black box\" AI systems, which lack ethical guardrails. High entropy in AI systems can decrease human trust, particularly in uncertain and competitive environments. The research draws inspiration from entropy studies to improve trust and performance in autonomous human-machine teams and systems, including interconnected elements in hierarchical systems. Applying this lens to improve trust in AI also highlights new opportunities to optimize performance in teams. Two use cases are described to validate the AI framework's ability to measure trust in the design and management of AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Stress is both a driver of objective performance impairments and a source of negative user experience of technology. This review addresses future directions for research on stress and ergonomics in the digital age. The review is structured around three levels of analysis. At the individual user level, stress is elicited by novel technologies and tasks including interaction with AI and robots, working in Virtual Reality, and operating autonomous vehicles. At the organisational level, novel, potentially stressful challenges include maintaining cybersecurity, surveillance and monitoring of employees supported by technology, and addressing bias and discrimination in the workplace. At the sociocultural level, technology, values and norms are evolving symbiotically, raising novel demands illustrated with respect to interactions with social media and new ethical challenges. We also briefly review the promise of neuroergonomics and emotional design to support stress mitigation. We conclude with seven high-level principles that may guide future work.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a crucial tool in healthcare with the primary aim of improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare delivery. By harnessing machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and computer vision, AI enables the analysis of complex medical data. The integration of AI into healthcare systems aims to support clinicians, personalize patient care, and enhance population health, all while addressing the challenges posed by rising costs and limited resources. As a subdivision of computer science, AI focuses on the development of advanced algorithms capable of performing complex tasks that were once reliant on human intelligence. The ultimate goal is to achieve human-level performance with improved efficiency and accuracy in problem-solving and task execution, thereby reducing the need for human intervention. Various industries, including engineering, media/entertainment, finance, and education, have already reaped significant benefits by incorporating AI systems into their operations. Notably, the healthcare sector has witnessed rapid growth in the utilization of AI technology. Nevertheless, there remains untapped potential for AI to truly revolutionize the industry. It is important to note that despite concerns about job displacement, AI in healthcare should not be viewed as a threat to human workers. Instead, AI systems are designed to augment and support healthcare professionals, freeing up their time to focus on more complex and critical tasks. By automating routine and repetitive tasks, AI can alleviate the burden on healthcare professionals, allowing them to dedicate more attention to patient care and meaningful interactions. However, legal and ethical challenges must be addressed when embracing AI technology in medicine, alongside comprehensive public education to ensure widespread acceptance.",

    "title": "Companies Committed to Responsible AI: From Principles towards Implementation and Regulation?",
    "year": 2021,
    "citationCount": 79,
    "fieldCitationRatio": 44.34,
    "abstract": "The term ‘responsible AI’ has been coined to denote AI that is fair and non-biased, transparent and explainable, secure and safe, privacy-proof, accountable, and to the benefit of mankind. Since 2016, a great many organizations have pledged allegiance to such principles. Amongst them are 24 AI companies that did so by posting a commitment of the kind on their website and/or by joining the ‘Partnership on AI’. By means of a comprehensive web search, two questions are addressed by this study: (1) Did the signatory companies actually try to implement these principles in practice, and if so, how? (2) What are their views on the role of other societal actors in steering AI towards the stated principles (the issue of regulation)? It is concluded that some three of the largest amongst them have carried out valuable steps towards implementation, in particular by developing and open sourcing new software tools. To them, charges of mere ‘ethics washing’ do not apply. Moreover, some 10 companies from both the USA and Europe have publicly endorsed the position that apart from self-regulation, AI is in urgent need of governmental regulation. They mostly advocate focussing regulation on high-risk applications of AI, a policy which to them represents the sensible middle course between laissez-faire on the one hand and outright bans on technologies on the other. The future shaping of standards, ethical codes, and laws as a result of these regulatory efforts remains, of course, to be determined.",
