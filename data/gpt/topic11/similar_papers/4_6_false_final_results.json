    "title": "Ethics-Informed Multi-Agent Simulation for Social Media Moderation Policies",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of tools to simulate complex interactions between individual usersâ€™ ethical frames, AI moderators, and organizational policies hinders exploration of fairness and transparency outcomes.",
    "Motivation": "Fills internal and external gaps by employing interdisciplinary ethical principles to drive agent behaviors, enabling in silico experiments on the cascading effects of moderation strategies on user experience and ethical compliance.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-agent system where simulated user agents embody diverse ethical frames derived from psychology and education literature. AI moderation agents apply various fairness and transparency policies. The system tracks stress, trust, and ethical conflict metrics across scenarios.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Encode ethical frames and behavior rules into user agents. 2. Implement AI moderator agents reflecting different policy approaches. 3. Run simulations under diverse conditions, varying transparency, enforcement strictness, and user education measures. 4. Analyze emergent outcomes to inform real-world policy design.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Scenario with strict content enforcement and minimal user education. Expected Output: High user stress and rule circumvention behaviors emergent, illustrating trade-offs.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If agent behaviors are oversimplified, incorporate machine-learned user behavior models trained on real social media data to calibrate simulations."
