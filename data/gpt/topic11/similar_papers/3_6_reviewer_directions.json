          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that a single integrated toolkit can effectively balance and optimize across environmental impact, security, and performance in edge AI hardware-software co-design needs stronger justification. These objectives often present conflicting trade-offs, and the proposal lacks detail on how the toolkit will navigate these multidimensional tensions or prioritize competing metrics. Clarifying assumptions about trade-off management and validation strategy is essential to establish soundness of the approach, especially given the complexities in accurately modeling both security and environmental impacts within a unified framework. Consider explicitly defining assumptions about what can realistically be co-optimized and how multi-objective conflicts will be resolved or presented to the user within the toolkit's workflow in the Proposed_Method section and Problem_Statement context to strengthen conceptual rigor and user expectations management. This also affects the feasibility of iterative optimization steps proposed later in the plan, making this clarification a priority early on for grounding the research design and evaluation criteria expectations internally and externally for reproducibility and adoption prospects, thus addressing fundamental soundness concerns upfront to avoid downstream misunderstandings or unrealistic claims of toolkit capabilities and impact potential in practical edge AI deployment settings with resource constraints and security threats that evolve rapidly in real environments with heterogeneous devices and usage patterns. Without this, the novelty and practical impact could be undermined by the toolkit's inability to balance these critical objectives transparently and effectively during co-design exploration iterations, hurting reliability and generalizability assessments reported in the experiment plan validations and real hardware tests phases, which depend on realistic and meaningful multi-criteria optimization assumptions being met and well-articulated upfront for the reader, reviewer, and future user. In summary, articulate and justify these key assumptions clearly in the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method to ensure foundational soundness and methodological credibility of the entire research workflow and toolkit goals for sustainable, secure, and performant edge AI co-design scenarios. See [SOU-ASSUMPTION]."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as 'NOV-COMPETITIVE' and the globally-linked concepts provided, integrating 'human-centred design' and 'real-time decision-making' aspects could significantly enhance the toolkit's impact and competitiveness. Specifically, incorporating a human-in-the-loop module to facilitate adaptive and interpretable co-design decisions, where system designers interact with intermediate results and trade-offs in real time, can increase practicality and user adoption. Furthermore, leveraging 'version control' paradigms for AI model and hardware configuration iterations within the toolkit could promote traceability and collaboration, aligning with software engineering best practices and thus broadening usage scenarios and community engagement. Additionally, borrowing ideas from 'IoT platform' management and 'low-latency data processing' to simulate realistic edge environments more accurately can improve fidelity of hardware-in-the-loop testing and better reflect deployment conditions. Combining these with the existing security and sustainability focus can carve a unique niche amid a competitive research landscape by emphasizing usability, collaboration, and deployment relevance grounded in current trends of edge AI and cyber-physical systems. Suggest enhancing the Proposed_Method and Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan sections with explicit modules or phases that realize this integration, such as designing user interfaces for decision visualization and feedback or adopting version control workflows. This strategic fusion could raise the toolkit from a purely technical prototype to a comprehensive co-design ecosystem that engages broader stakeholders including practitioners and researchers, thereby increasing impact and fostering sustained innovation over time beyond initial simulation and benchmark validation stages. Hence, the research idea will better address practical challenges in evolving edge AI systems and stand out distinctly in a competitive space through this multidimensional enhancement.
