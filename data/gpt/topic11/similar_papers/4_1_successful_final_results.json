    "title": "Educational Ethics-Inspired Interactive Transparency Module",
    "Problem_Statement": "AI moderation transparency currently centers around technical explainability, insufficiently engaging users in ethical understanding, limiting user empowerment and trust.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to critical external gap by applying educational ethics principles to foster ongoing user education and ethical engagement as a form of operationalized transparency in LLM-driven moderation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an interactive transparency interface that educates users about moderation decisions through layered ethical narratives, case studies, and risk mitigation scenarios inspired by educational ethics curricula. The module adapts content based on user responses, promoting ethical literacy and reducing negative user reactions.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop curriculum-based transparency content referencing real moderation cases. 2. Integrate into a moderation dashboard as an interactive module. 3. Pilot with social media users undergoing moderated content flags. 4. Measure changes in perceived fairness, trust, and knowledge retention versus standard opaque or static explanations. 5. Refine adaptivity rules based on feedback loops.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User receives notification with flagged content. Expected Output: Transparency module presents an explanation framed with ethical principles, invites user to view a short educational vignette, and offers suggestions for risk mitigation behaviors in future posts.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If users find the module too complex or avoid interaction, simplify content to bite-sized key points or integrate gamified ethical quizzes to boost engagement."

        "title": "Educational Ethics-Inspired Adaptive Transparency Module Enhancing Organizational Justice and Psychological Safety in AI Moderation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current AI moderation transparency approaches focus primarily on technical explainability, lacking dynamic and context-sensitive engagement with users' ethical understanding and organizational perceptions. This limits empowerment, trust, and sustained platform usage, particularly as static explanations do not address diverse user responses or foster perceptions of fairness and psychological safety at a community level.",
        "Motivation": "To overcome limitations of conventional transparency tools, this research innovatively integrates educational ethics principles with organizational justice theory and psychological safety constructs. By embedding adaptive, interactive learning tailored to user responses and linking transparency content with organizational justice signals, the module aims to foster ethical literacy alongside community-level trust and engagement—thus differentiating itself from existing static or generic transparency mechanisms in AI moderation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose designing a multi-layered adaptive transparency interface that dynamically adjusts educational ethics content based on real-time user interactions and responses. User inputs—collected via questionnaire sliders, scenario-based choices, and feedback mechanisms—will be processed by an adaptive algorithm inspired by competency-based adaptive learning frameworks and human-computer interaction models in ethical training. This algorithm modulates the complexity and framing of ethical narratives, case studies, and risk mitigation suggestions to align with each user's comprehension and responses.\n\nTo ensure consistency and avoid complexity, all educational content will be systematically linked to the specific moderation context through a taxonomy aligning AI moderation categories with relevant ethical principles and risk scenarios. Additionally, the module incorporates organizational justice enhancement by embedding interactive elements enabling users to voice fairness concerns or feedback regarding moderation decisions. These inputs will be analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling to examine their influence on psychological safety, perceived fairness, and continuous usage intention within a community context.\n\nThis dual-layered adaptation—at both the individual ethical literacy and organizational justice perception levels—promotes not only user understanding but also psychological safety and engagement across social media platform communities, fostering organizational identification and trust. The interface design draws from HCI best practices for simplicity and engagement, with fallback gamified ethical quizzes if complexity impedes interaction.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop an ethical content taxonomy aligning AI moderation categories with educational ethics principles and relevant risk mitigation scenarios.\n2. Build the adaptive algorithm using competency-based learning and HCI models to modulate transparency content in response to user inputs.\n3. Integrate organizational justice interactive feedback elements capturing user fairness perceptions.\n4. Embed partial least squares SEM analytics to model relationships between collected feedback, psychological safety, perceived fairness, and continuous platform usage intention.\n5. Implement the module in a moderation dashboard pilot with diverse social media users undergoing content moderation.\n6. Evaluate via mixed methods: quantitative assessment of ethical literacy gains, perceived organizational justice, psychological safety, trust metrics, and platform usage intentions; qualitative interviews exploring user experience and complexity.\n7. Refine adaptive algorithm and interface based on feedback loops targeting clarity, engagement, and alignment with justice perceptions.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user receives a flagged content notification on a social media platform.\nExpected Output: The module presents a tailored explanation of the moderation decision framed by ethical principles directly relevant to the content category. The user is invited to participate in a brief scenario-based vignette illustrating ethical challenges and risk mitigation strategies. Based on their responses, the transparency content adapts in complexity and focus. The module then prompts the user to provide feedback on the perceived fairness of the decision, which is securely submitted and analyzed.\nThe user subsequently receives summary insights on how their feedback contributes to organizational fairness improvements and community psychological safety, reinforcing trust and continuous engagement.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should users find the adaptive content too complex or avoid interaction, the system will automatically simplify information into core ethical takeaways using bite-sized, visually guided key points. To boost engagement, gamified quizzes on ethical scenarios linked to moderation will be introduced, incentivizing interaction with rewards or badges. Additionally, user feedback mechanisms will be streamlined to one-click fairness perception ratings to lower barriers. Ongoing user analytics will identify points of drop-off, enabling iterative refinement of content simplicity and interactive features to balance depth and accessibility."

          "feedback_content": "The design of the interactive transparency interface, while conceptually appealing, lacks a detailed explanation of how the system effectively adapts educational ethics content based on user responses. Clarify the mechanisms for real-time adaptivity: for instance, how user inputs are interpreted, how content layers are modulated, and how ethical literacy gains are measured dynamically. Without this clarity, it is difficult to evaluate the plausibility and reliability of the method in practice. Provide more explicit algorithmic or interface design frameworks to demonstrate soundness of the mechanism beyond conceptual description, possibly drawing on existing adaptive learning or human-computer interaction models linked to ethical training contexts, ensuring robustness of the method's operation and its user experience impact assessment in the experimental phase.\n\nFurthermore, specify how the ethical narratives and risk mitigation scenarios will be consistently linked to AI moderation decisions to avoid perceived dissonance or over-complexity for diverse user groups and content types."

          "feedback_content": "To enhance both the novelty and impact of the educational ethics-inspired transparency module, consider integrating concepts from 'organizational justice effect' and 'psychological safety' derived from the globally linked concepts. Specifically, you can expand the module to explicitly measure and promote perceived organizational justice through the transparency interface, thereby fostering psychological safety among users of social media platforms. This can involve embedding interactive elements that allow users to voice concerns or feedback about moderation fairness, which in turn could be analyzed using partial least squares techniques to model their continuous usage intention and trust. This integration would not only broaden the potential application of the module beyond individual ethical literacy to organizational and community-level effects, but also situate the research in a multidisciplinary framework that could meaningfully differentiate it within the competitive space."
