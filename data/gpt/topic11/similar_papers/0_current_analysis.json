These capabilities make FMs a valuable tool for a variety of tasks, including biomedical reasoning, hypothesis generation, and interpreting complex imaging data. In this review paper, we address the unique challenges associated with establishing an ethical and trustworthy biomedical AI ecosystem, with a particular focus on the development of FMs and their downstream applications. We explore strategies that can be implemented throughout the biomedical AI pipeline to effectively tackle these challenges, ensuring that these FMs are translated responsibly into clinical and translational settings. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of key stewardship and co-design principles that not only ensure robust regulation but also guarantee that the interests of all stakeholders-especially those involved in or affected by these clinical and translational applications-are adequately represented. We aim to empower the biomedical AI community to harness these models responsibly and effectively. As we navigate this exciting frontier, our collective commitment to ethical stewardship, co-design, and responsible translation will be instrumental in ensuring that the evolution of FMs truly enhances patient care and medical decision-making, ultimately leading to a more equitable and trustworthy biomedical AI ecosystem.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'De-Biased Disentanglement Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Survival Prediction on Multimodal Data', 'abstract': 'Health disparities among marginalized populations with lower socioeconomic status significantly impact the fairness and effectiveness of healthcare delivery. The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare presents an opportunity to address these inequalities, provided that AI models are free from bias. This paper aims to address the bias challenges by population disparities within healthcare systems, existing in the presentation of and development of algorithms, leading to inequitable medical implementation for conditions such as pulmonary embolism (PE) prognosis. In this study, we explore the diverse bias in healthcare systems, which highlights the demand for a holistic framework to reducing bias by complementary aggregation. By leveraging de-biasing deep survival prediction models, we propose a framework that disentangles identifiable information from images, text reports, and clinical variables to mitigate potential biases within multimodal datasets. Our study offers several advantages over traditional clinical-based survival prediction methods, including richer survival-related characteristics and bias-complementary predicted results. By improving the robustness of survival analysis through this framework, we aim to benefit patients, clinicians, and researchers by enhancing fairness and accuracy in healthcare AI systems.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Enhancing Fairness in Disease Prediction by Optimizing Multiple Domain Adversarial Networks', 'abstract': \"Predictive models in biomedicine need to ensure equitable and reliable outcomes for the populations they are applied to. Unfortunately, biases in medical predictions can lead to unfair treatment and widening disparities, underscoring the need for effective techniques to address these issues. To enhance fairness, we introduce a framework based on a Multiple Domain Adversarial Neural Network (MDANN), which incorporates multiple adversarial components. In an MDANN, an adversarial module is applied to learn a fair pattern by negative gradients back-propagating across multiple sensitive features (i.e., characteristics of individuals that should not be used to discriminate unfairly between individuals when making predictions or decisions.) We leverage loss functions based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) to address the class imbalance, promoting equitable classification performance for minority groups (e.g., a subset of the population that is underrepresented or disadvantaged.) Moreover, we utilize pre-trained convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) to extract deep representations of data, aiming to enhance prediction accuracy and fairness. Combining these mechanisms, we alleviate biases and disparities to provide reliable and equitable disease prediction. We empirically demonstrate that the MDANN approach leads to better accuracy and fairness in predicting disease progression using brain imaging data for Alzheimer's Disease and Autism populations than state-of-the-art techniques.\"}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Open challenges and opportunities in federated foundation models towards biomedical healthcare', 'abstract': 'This survey explores the transformative impact of foundation models (FMs) in artificial intelligence, focusing on their integration with federated learning (FL) in biomedical research. Foundation models such as ChatGPT, LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and multimodal patient interactions. The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges, and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs and FL, laying the groundwork for healthcare innovations.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Algorithmic fairness in artificial intelligence for medicine and healthcare', 'abstract': 'In healthcare, the development and deployment of insufficiently fair systems of artificial intelligence (AI) can undermine the delivery of equitable care. Assessments of AI models stratified across subpopulations have revealed inequalities in how patients are diagnosed, treated and billed. In this Perspective, we outline fairness in machine learning through the lens of healthcare, and discuss how algorithmic biases (in data acquisition, genetic variation and intra-observer labelling variability, in particular) arise in clinical workflows and the resulting healthcare disparities. We also review emerging technology for mitigating biases via disentanglement, federated learning and model explainability, and their role in the development of AI-based software as a medical device.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Bias in artificial intelligence for medical imaging: fundamentals, detection, avoidance, mitigation, challenges, ethics, and prospects', 'abstract': 'Although artificial intelligence (AI) methods hold promise for medical imaging-based prediction tasks, their integration into medical practice may present a double-edged sword due to bias (i.e., systematic errors). AI algorithms have the potential to mitigate cognitive biases in human interpretation, but extensive research has highlighted the tendency of AI systems to internalize biases within their model. This fact, whether intentional or not, may ultimately lead to unintentional consequences in the clinical setting, potentially compromising patient outcomes. This concern is particularly important in medical imaging, where AI has been more progressively and widely embraced than any other medical field. A comprehensive understanding of bias at each stage of the AI pipeline is therefore essential to contribute to developing AI solutions that are not only less biased but also widely applicable. This international collaborative review effort aims to increase awareness within the medical imaging community about the importance of proactively identifying and addressing AI bias to prevent its negative consequences from being realized later. The authors began with the fundamentals of bias by explaining its different definitions and delineating various potential sources. Strategies for detecting and identifying bias were then outlined, followed by a review of techniques for its avoidance and mitigation. Moreover, ethical dimensions, challenges encountered, and prospects were discussed.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Generative Artificial Intelligence in Clinical Medicine and Impact on Gastroenterology', 'abstract': 'The pace of artificial intelligence (AI) integration into health care has accelerated with rapid advances in generative AI (genAI). Gastroenterology and hepatology in particular will be transformed due to the multimodal workflows that integrate endoscopic video, radiologic imaging, tabular data, and unstructured note text. GenAI will impact the entire spectrum of clinical experience, from administrative tasks, diagnostic guidance, and treatment recommendations. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, genAI is more flexible, with one platform able to be used across multiple tasks. Initial evidence suggests benefits in lower-level administrative tasks, such as clinical documentation, medical billing, and scheduling; and information tasks, such as patient education and summarization of the medical literature. No evidence exists for genAI solutions for more complex tasks relevant to clinical care, such as clinical reasoning for diagnostic and treatment decisions that may affect patient outcomes. Challenges of output reliability, data privacy, and useful integration remain; potential solutions include robust validation, regulatory oversight, and \"human-AI teaming\" strategies to ensure safe, effective deployment. We remain optimistic in the potential of genAI to augment clinical expertise due to the adaptability of genAI to handle multiple data modalities to obtain and focus relevant information flows and the human-friendly interfaces that facilitate ease of use. We believe that the potential of genAI for dynamic human-algorithmic interactions may allow for a degree of clinician-directed customization to enhance human presence.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'The generative revolution: AI foundation models in geospatial health—applications, challenges and future research', 'abstract': 'In an era of rapid technological advancements, generative artificial intelligence and foundation models are reshaping industries and offering new advanced solutions in a wide range of scientific areas, particularly in public and environmental health. However, foundation models have previously mostly focused on understanding and generating text, while geospatial features, interrelations, flows and correlations have been neglected. Thus, this paper outlines the importance of research into Geospatial Foundation Models, which have the potential to revolutionise digital health surveillance and public health. We examine the latest advances, opportunities, challenges, and ethical considerations of geospatial foundation models for research and applications in digital health. We focus on the specific challenges of integrating geospatial context with foundation models and lay out the future potential for multimodal geospatial foundation models for a variety of research avenues in digital health surveillance and health assessment.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Shaping the Future of Healthcare: Ethical Clinical Challenges and Pathways to Trustworthy AI', 'abstract': '<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, enabling advances in diagnostics, treatment optimization, and patient care.

    "title": "Research Landscape Map for Bias Mitigation Techniques in LLMs for Healthcare Applications",
    "current_research_landscape": "This research cluster focuses on mitigating biases in AI models, especially large language models and multimodal machine learning systems, applied to healthcare diagnostics and prognostics. Central concepts include domain adversarial neural networks, convolutional autoencoders, and their application for disease prediction in healthcare AI systems. The thematic islands reflect: (1) techniques leveraging domain adversarial networks and autoencoders to enhance fairness and reduce bias in disease prediction; (2) integration and delivery of AI within healthcare systems emphasizing effectiveness and equitable healthcare delivery; (3) co-design principles and ethical stewardship in biomedical AI ecosystems focusing on complex, multimodal data; and (4) AI-based software systems with an emphasis on responsible deployment. Dominant methods encompass adversarial learning to disentangle bias-related features, multimodal representation learning, fairness-aware model optimization (including domain adaptation), and embedding ethics and co-design in AI ecosystem development. Overall, the central problem is developing accurate, fair, and ethically trustworthy AI models for healthcare that address entrenched population and systemic biases affecting diagnostic and treatment equity.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps include the limited integration of ethical co-design principles directly within bias mitigation algorithms, which remain largely technical without a systematic workflow across the full AI pipeline. Although foundational papers call for responsible translation and stewardship, operational frameworks for measurable fairness in clinical contexts are underdeveloped. The absence of bridge nodes in the local network corroborates limited interdisciplinary linking among core technical and ethical concepts. Additionally, current methods focus mainly on known biases in imaging and survival prediction but lack scalable solutions for emergent biases in foundation models or LLMs in healthcare settings with complex multimodal data.\n\nExternally, the Global Context & Hidden Bridges analysis reveals overlooked intersections primarily between domain adversarial networks and healthcare systems, co-design, and AI-based software. For example, applying domain adversarial domain adaptation techniques with healthcare system dynamics and security could address domain shift and improve fairness robustness in real-world deployments prone to data heterogeneity. Similarly, integrating co-design with domain adversarial networks could enhance model adaptation with community-driven data annotations, improving bias detection and mitigation. Lastly, linking healthcare system knowledge frameworks with AI-based software underscores the need for implementation research and safety considerations, an aspect scantily covered in the local set but crucial to trustworthy AI adoption. These hidden bridges suggest that bridging machine learning fairness techniques with healthcare operations and participatory model design offers rich, understudied opportunities to enhance bias mitigation's clinical impact.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate domain adversarial network methods with healthcare system frameworks to develop adaptive bias mitigation techniques that address domain shifts observed in diverse clinical settings. This could leverage the identified hidden bridge between 'domain adversarial network' and 'healthcare system' concepts, enabling AI models to maintain fairness and accuracy despite data heterogeneity and evolving population characteristics.\n\nOpportunity 2: Implement co-design strategies incorporating patient, clinician, and community stakeholders in the development of domain adversarial learning frameworks. This aligns with the hidden bridge connecting 'domain adversarial network' and 'co-design,' addressing current internal gaps where ethical and participatory processes are insufficiently embedded in algorithmic bias mitigation, thereby improving model trustworthiness and contextual fairness.\n\nOpportunity 3: Develop comprehensive AI-based healthcare software informed by implementation science and safety frameworks to facilitate trustworthy deployment of bias-mitigated LLMs in clinical practice. This combines the bridge between 'healthcare system' and 'AI-based software,' addressing practical deployment challenges, regulatory needs, and consistent fairness evaluation in real healthcare workflows, ultimately ensuring equitable AI integration."
