    "title": "Multi-Modal Environmental Impact Indicators for Secure Edge AI Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "The current research fails to synthesize multiple environmental impact indicators (energy, water, materials) with security and performance metrics, limiting holistic sustainability assessment of AI models on edge devices.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the internal gap by pioneering a multi-dimensional environmental impact evaluation framework integrated into AI pipelines that balances security, accuracy, and diverse sustainability metrics, following innovation opportunities for unified assessment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an extensible suite of environmental impact indicators, including water footprint, rare material usage, and electronic waste potential, combined with energy consumption and carbon emissions. The system will embed these into secure AI operation monitoring tools using analytics dashboards for end users.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Research and model various environmental indicators relevant to AI hardware/software.\n2. Collect data for indicator quantification on typical edge hardware.\n3. Integrate indicators into AI security and performance monitoring software.\n4. Conduct user studies and experiments to analyze trade-offs in model selection and deployment decisions.\n5. Validate indicatorsâ€™ correlation with real-world sustainability outcomes.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI model deployment scenario on a secured single-board computing platform.\nOutput: Comprehensive sustainability report showing water consumption score, rare metal usage index, energy consumption, and security compliance score, guiding eco-friendly design choices.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If some indicators are difficult to quantify reliably, focus initial version on well-established metrics and progressively include additional indicators."
