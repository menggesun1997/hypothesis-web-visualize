    "title": "Carbon-Aware Scheduling and Load Balancing for Edge AI Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Edge AI systems process variable workloads, but scheduling and resource allocation rarely consider real-time carbon intensity of energy supply, resulting in unnecessarily high emissions during peak grid carbon intensity periods.",
    "Motivation": "This project targets the external gap of incorporating dynamic carbon footprint awareness into AI operation scheduling, extending Opportunity 1 by integrating green scheduling into secure edge AI pipelines, thereby operationalizing sustainability goals.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a scheduling framework that monitors the local grid's carbon intensity and dynamically adjusts the timing and resource allocation for model training and inference tasks to minimize environmental impact without sacrificing security or model performance deadlines.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect data on temporal carbon intensity variations in target deployment regions.\n2. Implement adaptive scheduler for AI tasks on single-board computers.\n3. Integrate secure transmission protocols and environmental impact monitoring.\n4. Benchmark against conventional scheduling methods using prediction accuracy, latency, and carbon emission metrics.\n5. Perform user scenario simulations for typical industrial IoT applications.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Batch of anomaly detection tasks queued on edge device during daytime peak grid emission hours.\nOutput: Tasks rescheduled to low-carbon night periods, reducing estimated carbon emissions by 20%, with maintained security and minimal latency increase.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic rescheduling causes operational disruption, implement partial scheduling based on workload criticality or use local renewable energy prediction to improve accuracy."
