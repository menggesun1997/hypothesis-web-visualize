    "title": "Implementation Science-Driven Software Framework for Bias-Mitigation in LLMs Deployed in Clinical Decision Support",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of comprehensive software frameworks informed by implementation science and safety standards that facilitate the trustworthy deployment of bias-mitigated large language models in real-world clinical workflows, hindering sustainable adoption and regulatory compliance.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap linking healthcare system knowledge with AI-based software, aiming to close a practical barrier that prevents theoretical fairness improvements from being translated into equitable clinical practice.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design and develop an AI deployment platform embedding bias mitigation modules (e.g., adversarial learnings and fairness monitors) tightly integrated with clinical decision support systems. The platform is informed by implementation science principles to include safety checklists, clinician override capabilities, real-time fairness auditing dashboards, and regulatory compliance documentation generators. It supports iterative monitoring and continuous learning post-deployment, ensuring persistent fairness and safety with minimal clinical disruption.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collaborate with clinical informatics teams to define deployment requirements and safety standards. 2) Integrate bias-mitigated LLMs (e.g., for risk prediction) into prototype clinical support software. 3) Conduct simulated clinical scenarios with domain experts interacting with software under various bias and data drift conditions. 4) Evaluate system usability, safety incident reduction, fairness maintenance over time, and clinician trust using quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback. 5) Refine software features based on user testing and compliance audits.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient records from a hospital EHR requesting risk stratification for heart failure readmission. Expected Output: LLM generates risk scores with built-in bias mitigation; clinicians can access fairness reports and override recommendations if needed; the system logs decisions for audit purposes.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If full software integration faces technical hurdles, fallback to deploying modular bias-mitigation and fairness auditing components as plugins within existing clinical AI infrastructures. User training and iterative feedback collection will be used to incrementally improve integration."
