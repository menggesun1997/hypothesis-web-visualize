    "title": "Behavioral Education-Based User-Coaching System for AI Moderation Compliance",
    "Problem_Statement": "Users often lack understanding of ethical norms underpinning social media moderation, leading to repeated violations and negative experiences, unaddressed by current AI frameworks.",
    "Motivation": "Innovates by integrating educational ethics and psychological behavior change frameworks into AI moderation, promoting user self-regulation and ethical awareness, closing gaps between user experience and ethical codes.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a behavioral coaching chatbot embedded in social media platforms that proactively engages users caught in moderation cycles, providing personalized ethics education, feedback, and risk mitigation strategies to encourage compliance and reduce negative impacts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop chatbot dialogue systems based on educational ethics curricula and behavioral psychology. 2. Pilot with users flagged multiple times for content violations. 3. Measure changes in violation frequency, user stress, and perception of fairness over time.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User receives chatbot message after repeated flags explaining the rationale with ethical stories and suggestions for alternative posting behavior. Expected Output: Decreased violation events and improved user sentiment scores.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If chatbot engagement is low, integrate incentives such as badges or social recognition to boost usage and test different motivational framing."

The mechanism through which personalized ethics education and feedback translate into measurable behavior change in the wild is under-specified. Strengthen this section by detailing the dialogue system architecture, personalization strategies, and how the chatbot adapts to diverse user profiles and violation contexts to ensure meaningful and contextually appropriate coaching interactions that can realistically influence user compliance and sentiment. Also consider how ethical storytelling will be operationalized within chatbot dialogues without risking user disengagement or skepticism due to perceived lecturing or automation bias. This will enhance the conceptual soundness and practical validity of the approach, beyond a high-level abstract description, making it more compelling and actionable for implementation and evaluation purposes (Proposed_Method)."

Currently, it does not specify details on experimental design aspects such as control groups or randomization to properly attribute observed changes to the chatbot intervention. Furthermore, key metrics such as 'user stress' and 'perception of fairness' appear subjective and require validated measurement instruments and sampling strategies. Include plans for data collection on chatbot usage patterns, longitudinal follow-up to assess sustained behavior change, and powering of the study with adequate participant numbers. Also address potential ethical considerations, privacy issues, and user consent in deploying a behavioral coaching chatbot in real social media contexts. By strengthening the experimental design and measurement plan, the research will be better positioned to yield scientifically valid and interpretable results that confirm feasibility and impact claims (Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)."

          "feedback_content": "To improve the impact and novelty in this highly competitive area, consider integrating the Technology Acceptance Model and moral self-regulatory processes into the system design and evaluation framework. Specifically, frame chatbot adoption and sustained engagement through perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use constructs, and model how users' moral self-regulatory processes influence their responsiveness to behavioral coaching. Incorporate randomized controlled trials to rigorously assess the causal effects of the intervention on violation frequency and ethical awareness. Further, leveraging insights from moral disengagement literature could inform the personalization of coaching messages to counter rationalizations for misconduct. Embedding these globally-linked concepts will provide a stronger theoretical foundation, improve user acceptance, and better position the system for broader impact and competitive differentiation (Globally-Linked Concepts)."
