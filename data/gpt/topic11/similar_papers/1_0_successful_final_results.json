    "title": "Hybrid Federated LLM Training Leveraging Cloud-Edge Trust Zones",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current federated learning approaches for training LLMs in financial services face scalability and security challenges, especially when integrating edge devices and cloud infrastructures. The lack of scalable, privacy-preserving architectures that harmonize decentralized training with trusted execution environments limits real-world deployment.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient scalable privacy-preserving methods for large generative AI models (LLMs) and the external ‘hidden bridge’ between collaborative platforms, federated learning, and trusted execution environments in cloud-edge hybrid architectures, to enable secure, scalable LLM training in finance.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a hierarchical federated learning framework where financial institutions serve as edge nodes running LLM training inside trusted execution environments (TEEs). Aggregation servers in the cloud coordinate parameter updates securely. The method employs homomorphic encryption combined with TEE attestation for verification. Novel workload partition algorithms optimize model slicing between edge and cloud to reduce communication overhead while preserving privacy.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect financial text datasets across multiple institutions (synthetic and institutional datasets). 2) Implement LLM training with the proposed federated method using simulated cloud-edge environments with TEEs (e.g., Intel SGX). 3) Baselines: centralized training, standard federated learning without TEEs. 4) Metrics: model utility (accuracy, perplexity), privacy leakage (differential privacy metrics), scalability (training time, communication cost), and robustness to adversarial nodes. 5) Perform ablation on partitioning and encryption parameters.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Sample input: Financial transaction logs split across three edge nodes. Expected output: A jointly trained LLM model that accurately predicts fraudulent patterns without exposing raw data from any institution, verified through TEE attestations and encrypted communication.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If communication overhead is too high, test alternative lightweight encryption schemes or reduce model size with pruning. If TEEs limit scalability, explore software-based secure multiparty computation as a fallback."

        "title": "Blockchain-Enhanced Hybrid Federated LLM Training Leveraging Cloud-Edge Trust Zones with Layered Cryptographic Protocols",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current federated learning approaches for training LLMs in financial services struggle with scalability, privacy, and secure trust verification, especially when integrating edge devices and cloud infrastructures. Existing methods using TEEs and homomorphic encryption face challenges in optimizing communication overhead while guaranteeing robust adversarial resistance. Furthermore, the absence of a decentralized, immutable trust and audit framework for parameter updates limits compliance and accountability in multi-institution financial collaborations.",
        "Motivation": "While federated learning combined with TEEs and homomorphic encryption has advanced secure collaborative model training, their incremental integration limits novelty and practical impact in complex financial domains. This proposal advances the state-of-the-art by explicitly integrating blockchain-based decentralized identity management and immutable audit trails to complement TEEs and cryptographic protocols. By doing so, it establishes a layered security architecture that ensures scalable, verifiable, and privacy-preserving federated LLM training with robust adversarial awareness and compliance auditing, surpassing current competitive approaches.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hierarchical federated learning framework enhanced with a blockchain-based decentralized identity and governance layer to complement cloud-edge TEEs and homomorphic encryption. Financial institutions act as edge nodes running segmented LLM training inside TEEs, where model slicing is optimized via a communication-privacy trade-off algorithm leveraging workload partitioning heuristics (detailed below). Parameter updates are homomorphically encrypted and submitted with TEE attestation proofs to cloud aggregation servers. These updates are logged on a permissioned blockchain that manages decentralized identities (DIDs) for participant authentication and maintains an immutable audit trail of updates, supporting compliance verification and adversarial accountability.\n\nKey Mechanism Details:\n1. **Workload Partitioning Algorithm:** Formally defines model slicing ratios balancing communication overhead and privacy using a constrained optimization framework minimizing total latency subject to privacy leakage bounds. The method iteratively adjusts partitioning parameters based on network conditions and privacy metrics. Pseudocode provided below.\n\n2. **Integration of TEEs and Homomorphic Encryption:** Each edge node trains a model shard inside a TEE, generating attestation reports for the encrypted parameter updates. The cloud aggregator verifies attestation before homomorphically aggregating updates without decryption, preserving end-to-end privacy.\n\n3. **Blockchain-Enabled Decentralized Identity (DID) and Audit:** Nodes register with the permissioned blockchain to obtain verifiable credentials. Parameter update hashes and TEE attestations are timestamped on-chain, enabling immutable provenance tracking and detection of anomalies or adversarial manipulation.\n\n4. **Layered Fallbacks:** If TEE resource constraints arise, the protocol seamlessly shifts to software-based secure multiparty computation integrated with blockchain verification for robustness.\n\n**Pseudocode for Workload Partitioning Algorithm:**\n```\nInput: Model size M, bandwidth B, privacy budget ε, initial partition p_0\nOutput: Partition ratio p* minimizing overhead & leakage\nInitialize p = p_0\nrepeat\n   Compute communication_estimate = f_comm(p, M, B)\n   Compute privacy_leakage = f_priv(p, ε)\n   Update p by gradient step minimizing α*communication_estimate + β*privacy_leakage\nuntil convergence\nreturn p\n```\n\n**Architectural Diagram (Described):** Edge nodes with TEEs train local model partitions → Encrypted updates + TEE attestations → Cloud aggregator verifies and securely aggregates → Update hashes + attestations recorded on blockchain ledger → Federated model updated and shared back.\n\nThis design marries centralized trust at the TEE level with decentralized trust and compliance assurance via blockchain, providing distinct technical and practical advantages over purely TEE/homomorphic encryption or blockchain-based approaches alone.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Preparation: Collect heterogeneous financial text datasets (synthetic and real) distributed among multiple institutions.\n2) Implementation: Develop the federated training framework with integrated TEEs (e.g., Intel SGX) and homomorphic encryption libraries. Integrate a permissioned blockchain platform (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) to manage identities and audit logs.\n3) Baselines: Compare against centralized training, federated learning with TEEs only, and federated learning with blockchain only.\n4) Metrics: Evaluate model utility (accuracy, perplexity), training efficiency (communication overhead, latency), privacy leakage (differential privacy measures), adversarial robustness, trust verification latency, and compliance audit effectiveness.\n5) Ablation Studies: Analyze the impact of workload partitioning parameters, blockchain consensus overhead, and fallback protocol activation under TEE failures.\n6) Security Analysis: Test under adversarial scenarios including malicious nodes attempting data leakage or false attestations.\n7) Scalability Tests: Assess performance across varying number of nodes and network conditions.\n\nThis detailed plan ensures the linkage between the core method design and experimental validations to reveal bottlenecks and parameter bounds early.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: Financial transaction logs partitioned across four financial institutions running edge nodes with TEEs.\n\nExpected Output: Jointly trained LLM model that reliably predicts fraudulent patterns, verified by:\n- Successful blockchain-logged attestations of all parameter updates,\n- Privacy guarantees with homomorphic encryption and differential privacy thresholding,\n- Real-time detection and rejection of any adversarial manipulations within parameter update streams.\n\nThe system outputs audit logs accessible to compliance officers, demonstrating integrity and provenance of training data updates without revealing raw sensitive information.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If communication overhead caused by homomorphic encryption and blockchain logging becomes excessive, deploy adaptive workload partitioning to reduce model slice sizes and prune the model layers where feasible.\n\nIf TEE limitations constrain scalability or introduce unpredictability, transition to a hybrid fallback protocol combining software-based secure multiparty computation with blockchain verifications for trust enforcement.\n\nMoreover, blockchain consensus parameters (e.g., block frequency, size) can be tuned dynamically to balance audit granularity and system throughput.\n\nThese fallback strategies are directly aligned with core mechanism parameters and have defined trigger conditions informed by the experimental phase, ensuring robustness without sacrificing security or privacy."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an ambitious integration of hierarchical federated learning, TEEs, homomorphic encryption, and novel workload partitioning. However, the precise mechanism by which model slicing will be optimized for communication overhead versus privacy preservation is not sufficiently detailed. The interaction between TEE attestation and homomorphic encryption in a multi-institution setting needs clarification to establish how trust and verification will be maintained without introducing prohibitive latency or complexity. Addressing these clarifications will strengthen the soundness and technical clarity of the core framework, ensuring it is realistically implementable and that security guarantees hold under adversarial conditions prevalent in financial domains, where threat models can be complex and subtle. Specific algorithmic details or architectural diagrams could significantly improve understanding and confidence in the mechanism proposed. This is critical, given the integration of several advanced components with different security and computation trade-offs that must work harmoniously for real-world scalability and robustness to adversarial nodes to be credible and replicable in practice.  Please elaborate these mechanisms explicitly, possibly with pseudo-code or a formal description of the protocol steps involving TEEs, attestation, encryption, and workload partitioning within the federated learning framework.  This will also aid feasiblity assessments and downstream experimental designs, revealing potential system bottlenecks early on and guiding realistic parameter settings and fallback strategy development, which are currently only broadly sketched in the plan, rather than tightly linked to the core method design.

          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty is deemed NOV-COMPETITIVE due to the highly active and linked research in federated learning combined with TEEs and cloud-edge architectures, the impact and novelty could be enhanced by more explicitly integrating blockchain-based identity or decentralized model training paradigms from the 'Globally-Linked Concepts'. Introducing blockchain-based identity management could strengthen decentralized trust and provenance of training updates further than TEE and homomorphic encryption alone, potentially offering an immutable audit trail for compliance and robust adversarial accountability, which is paramount for financial applications. Alternatively, exploring hybrid cryptographic protocols with software-based secure multiparty computation (as an advanced fallback) aligned with blockchain verification might offer a layered security paradigm that balances efficiency and robust decentralization. Such integration would not only broaden the scope by bridging trusted execution and decentralized verification paradigms but also position the work more distinctly relative to current state-of-the-art, potentially moving beyond incremental combination to foundational architectural innovation for financial federated LLM training. Please consider revisiting the design to explicitly incorporate these concepts with a plan or rationale for how blockchain or decentralized identity can complement TEE and federated learning, thereby boosting both novelty and real-world impact.
