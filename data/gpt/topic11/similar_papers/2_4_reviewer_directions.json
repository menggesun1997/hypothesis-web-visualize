    "Problem_Statement": "Current legal text access lacks personalized, dynamic authentication integrated with explainable AI, risking security and auditability.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to external gaps suggesting behavioral biometrics and multi-factor authentication concepts applied to secure, explainable AI models for legal text access, thereby innovating in user-centric security and transparency.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an AI system that leverages behavioral biometrics (keystroke dynamics, usage patterns) as an explainable additional authentication layer controlling access to legal LLM outputs. Incorporate explainability to justify authentication decisions and request access levels.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build dataset capturing behavioral biometrics in legal document usage.\n2) Implement baselines for biometric authentication.\n3) Integrate with legal LLM access control and explanation engines.\n4) Assess authentication accuracy, security, user acceptance, and explainability effectiveness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User request to query sensitive client data.\nOutput: Access granted with explanations combining biometric confidence scores and policy compliance justifications.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If biometric signals are inconsistent, fallback to traditional MFA methods while improving signal quality via feature engineering or sensor fusion."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposal suggests leveraging behavioral biometrics as an explainable authentication layer, the mechanism detailing how explainability will be concretely achieved remains underdeveloped. It is unclear how the system will balance the interpretability of biometric signals with the complexity of authentication decisions, especially integrating explanations that are meaningful and trustworthy to legal system users. A clearer, more detailed explanation of the architecture and methods used to generate these explanations (e.g., model type, explanation techniques, and how they tie to policy compliance) is essential to validate the proposed method's soundness and practicality in this sensitive domain.\n\nRecommendation: Elaborate on the explainability framework, possibly with example techniques or models, and clarify how explanations will be generated, evaluated, and presented to end users for authentication decisions in the legal context. Clarify assumptions about biometric variability and how explanations will handle these nuances responsibly to maintain user trust and auditability in legal AI systems.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines important components but lacks sufficient detail to assess feasibility comprehensively. Key challenges include the collection of a high-quality, representative behavioral biometrics dataset from legal professionals (who are often privacy-sensitive and have limited availability), and integration of biometric authentication tightly with legal LLM access and explanation engines. Potential difficulties in annotating data for explainability assessment and quantifying user acceptance in a domain as sensitive as legal systems require more concrete strategies.\n\nRecommendation: Provide further detail on data collection methods ensuring privacy and compliance, intended baselines, metrics for explainability and user acceptance, and contingency strategies beyond sensor fusion (e.g., simulation or synthetic data generation). Consider piloting with a smaller user group or leveraging existing biometric datasets adapted to legal domain constraints before full integration.\n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
