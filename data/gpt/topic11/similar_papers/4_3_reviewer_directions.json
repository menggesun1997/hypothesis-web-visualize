    "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Ethical Frame Embedding in Moderation Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM-driven moderation systems apply fairness and ethics as abstract constraints without operationalizing rich interdisciplinary ethical frames spanning psychology, education, and philosophy.",
    "Motivation": "Bridges the silo of AI fairness frameworks and interdisciplinary ethical knowledge, addressing the external hidden bridge gap by embedding comprehensive ethical frames directly into model parameters and decision logic.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a knowledge base of ethical concepts from education, psychology, and philosophy encoded as constraints and heuristics. Integrate these as trainable embeddings or prompts within LLM-based moderation models to guide content filtering decisions respecting nuanced ethical perspectives.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate and formalize cross-disciplinary ethics knowledge bases. 2. Convert ethical frames into embedding space or prompt templates. 3. Fine-tune existing moderation LLMs with these augmented inputs. 4. Evaluate on benchmarks for fairness, accountability, and nuanced ethical reasoning.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Content with conflicting ethical considerations (e.g., free speech vs. harm). Expected Output: Moderation reflects balanced decision-making informed by embedded ethical frames explaining rationale.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct embedding harms performance, modularize ethics knowledge as external interpretable decision aids layered onto model outputs."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines integrating interdisciplinary ethical frames as trainable embeddings or prompts within moderation LLMs, but it lacks detailed explanation about how ethical complexities, which are often context-dependent and sometimes contradictory, will be operationalized in model parameters without oversimplification. The mechanism to balance these conflicting ethical considerations and maintain moderation robustness needs clearer elucidation, including how model interpretability and ethical rationale extraction are ensured in practice to avoid opaque decisions or ethical misalignments. Enhancing clarity on this mechanism is essential for assessing soundness and practicality of the approach to embed nuanced ethical reasoning into moderation systems without degrading decision quality or transparency. Suggest detailing algorithmic strategies, constraint formulation, and integration points between knowledge bases and LLM architectures to strengthen this core design aspect, enabling more precise evaluation of soundness and effectiveness in capturing interdisciplinary ethical reasoning within a single model framework or hybrid system if applicable. This clarity will also help stakeholders understand trade-offs between ethical fidelity and computational feasibility, foundational to credible policy and social impact claims."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is logically structured but omits critical details on evaluation benchmarks and metrics beyond generic terms such as fairness and nuanced ethical reasoning. It is crucial to identify or develop standardized datasets and metrics that can rigorously assess how well the moderation decisions align with interdisciplinary ethical frames, including metrics capturing ethical rationales, transparency, and conflict resolution between competing ethical principles (e.g., free speech vs. harm). Additionally, the plan should address challenges in formalizing interdisciplinary ethical knowledge into computational forms and methods to validate that embeddings or prompts truly represent the intended ethical nuances. There is also no mention of potential scalability and generalization tests across diverse content domains and cultural contexts. Including clear scientific validation strategies, ablation studies to isolate the effect of ethical embedding, and fallback plan experimental benchmarks will improve feasibility assessment and practical insights into model behavior under real-world moderation conditions."

          "feedback_content": "To enhance both novelty and impact beyond a crowded competitive space, consider integrating concepts from 'commonsense reasoning' and 'constitutional economics' to enrich the ethical frame embedding framework. For example, incorporating commonsense reasoning modules could help moderation models better understand contextual nuances, while constitutional economics principles could provide a structured approach to balancing individual rights (like free speech) with collective societal welfare in moderation policies. This fusion can create a richer, multi-layered decision logic that transcends traditional ethical heuristics by grounding them in socio-economic trade-offs and everyday reasoning, potentially leading to more interpretable and societally aligned moderation outcomes. Such integration could differentiate the work by providing a theoretically and practically grounded scaffold to encode and operationalize ethical frames, positioning the research at the intersection of AI ethics, social science, and computational reasoning."
