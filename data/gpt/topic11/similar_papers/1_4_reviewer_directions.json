    "title": "Explainable AI Framework for Privacy-Preserving Financial LLMs Ensuring Regulatory Transparency",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of interpretable and explainable mechanisms within privacy-preserving LLMs in finance limits regulatory acceptance and consumer trust, especially when AI decisions affect contract fairness and sensitive financial outcomes.",
    "Motivation": "Bridges the gap of regulatory compliance and transparency highlighted in collaborative platform application-level security links by embedding explainability tailored for privacy-aware large language models within financial contexts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an explainable AI (XAI) architecture combining differential privacy techniques with causal attribution models to provide interpretable explanations of LLM outputs without compromising privacy. The framework generates legal-compliant justification narratives for automated financial decisions, integrating with blockchain-based audit logs for immutable traceability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets with annotated rationales for financial decisions. 2) Incorporate differential privacy noise within LLM outputs. 3) Use causal explanation algorithms to extract transparent explanations. 4) Evaluate explanations for fidelity, completeness, and privacy guarantees. 5) User studies with regulators and financial consumers to assess trust.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Sample input: LLM-generated credit risk assessment for an individual. Expected output: Privacy-preserved risk score alongside a transparent explanation tied to specific financial indicators, logged securely for auditability.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If differential privacy impairs explanation quality, experiment with personalized privacy budgets or post-hoc explanation methods that separate private computation from explanation generation."

          "feedback_content": "While the experiment plan outlines key steps, it lacks concrete details on dataset sourcing and handling sensitive financial data with annotated rationales, which is notoriously difficult to obtain in this domain due to privacy and regulatory constraints. Additionally, steps 2 and 3 (incorporation of differential privacy noise and causal explanation algorithms) require careful synchronization; the plan should clarify how privacy-preserving noise injection will interact with causal explanation extraction without degrading explanation quality irreparably. The fallback plan touches on this issue but would benefit from a more rigorous backup experimental protocol, such as testing modular pipeline components independently or leveraging synthetic data. Overall, the feasibility would improve by expanding the experimental plan with concrete dataset acquisition strategies, clearer integration protocols, and success criteria for each stage, especially for user studies with regulators which may involve significant logistical challenges and require more detailed planning and evaluation metrics for trust assessment in regulatory contexts. This level of detail is essential given the complex intersection of privacy, explainability and legal compliance in finance contexts.  Suggestions include specifying candidate financial datasets (public or proprietary with partnerships), outlining simulator or synthetic data generation if access is constrained, and providing preliminary metrics and user study design details to validate both privacy and explanation fidelity robustly across diverse stakeholder groups.  This will make the experiment plan more scientifically sound and practical to implement, thereby enhancing credibility and likelihood of successful demonstration at scale for the proposed approach.  The authors should address these points to improve the practical applicability of their research plan substantially and increase confidence in feasibility prior to undertaking extensive development work.  This critique targets the Experiment_Plan section directly and advises refinement toward operational clarity and experimental robustness beyond conceptual description only, given the critical challenges in the financial LLMS privacy and explainability space.  This is critical to ensure the promising idea can be realized with meaningful evidence and utility in real-world regulatory environments, and not remain at high-level theoretical design stage only.  In sum, the experiment plan needs deepening in both scientific design and logistical execution regarding dataset, method integration, and user evaluation for trust and transparency in regulatory settings, which are complex and multifaceted requirements in the proposal context.  Addressing these weaknesses will materially increase the work’s practicality and value significantly and is therefore of the highest priority for refinement and revision prior to further development or submission.  This feedback is therefore prioritized first to ensure a solid foundation for the contribution's scientific soundness and feasibility in operation as proposed in the plan and budgeted scope.  Clearer, more concrete experiment design detail will also reduce risks of unforeseen failures or gaps in method validation, which are endemic risks in interdisciplinary privacy-preserving finance ML research projects today.  Hence, this feedback offers actionable guidance to strengthen, clarify, and thoroughly ground the empirical efforts planned to realize the novel explainability and privacy guarantees ambition in this work, which is necessary for acceptance and real impact potential in the domain.  By implementing these suggestions, the proposal will rise substnatially in rigor and feasibility from a research and engineering perspective, greatly improving prospects of success in this difficult but important research niche, particularly when competing with other state-of-the-art solutions in a crowded field.  This will also provide more persuasive evidence to reviewers and stakeholders on the maturity of the approach to meet both academic and regulatory expectations simultaneously, which underpin the paper’s intended novelty and impact claims as framed in the proposal and title.  Thus, it is the highest-impact revision focus recommended at this time to enable realization of the paper’s potential contributions through a robust and credible experimentation framework, ensuring the idea moves beyond conceptual novelty to demonstrable value and regulatory readiness.  In summary: The experiment plan is not yet sufficiently detailed and practically executable to evaluate the feasibility claims made; strengthening it via concrete datasets, interaction details between privacy and explanation components, fallback experimental protocols, and structured user evaluation design focused on regulatory and consumer trust is vital before proceeding further to have a convincing, implementable research roadmap for the proposed framework in this complex financial setting."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the competitive landscape in privacy-preserving explainable AI, the authors should consider integrating complementary emerging concepts to broaden impact and boost novelty. Specifically, linking their framework with federated learning—a globally relevant approach in privacy-sensitive domains—could enable decentralized training of financial LLMs without raw data sharing, enhancing privacy beyond differential privacy noise injection alone. This integration could also address dataset scarcity issues by leveraging distributed financial data silos, potentially improving model generalization and regulatory acceptance. Furthermore, exploring intelligent decision-making paradigms with the causal explanation models could enhance the interpretability and fairness dimensions of automated financial decisions. Incorporating blockchain audit trails alongside federated learning would augment security, traceability, and possibly streamline compliance verification workflows. The authors might also explore transfer learning to adapt pre-trained LLMs in finance to diverse regulatory regimes or financial products, thereby extending framework applicability across global markets. This global integration approach will strategically position the proposal in cutting-edge intersections between explainable AI, privacy, federated architectures, and secure auditability, elevating its contribution beyond a single-method solution to a more comprehensive ecosystem architecture. This in turn can drive higher impact at both research and practical adoption levels in a fiercely competitive research area by addressing multiple pressing challenges simultaneously.  In sum, the authors should explicitly explore and incorporate these globally-linked interdisciplinary techniques to enhance the scope, robustness, and novelty of their solution.  This will make the proposal more compelling and future-proof by demonstrating alignment with broader research trends and real-world deployment constraints, while enhancing the uniqueness and depth of their contribution in the financial privacy-preserving explainable AI domain.  This feedback targets discovery of novel integration pathways to augment the proposal’s competitiveness and relevance using the provided related global concepts as a springboard toward a richer, more innovative final research contribution above the already strong but nonetheless crowded baseline combination of privacy, XAI, and blockchain auditing in financial LLMs."
