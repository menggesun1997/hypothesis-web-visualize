    "title": "Unified Environmental Impact Assessment Framework for Edge AI Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current AI deployment on edge devices such as single-board computers optimizes for security and performance without explicitly accounting for environmental impact. This leads to hidden carbon footprints during both training and inference stages, obscuring sustainability evaluation.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical internal gap of lacking lifecycle and environmental impact metrics integrated into AI systems operating on constrained hardware. It also leverages the innovation opportunity to combine environmental impact assessments with existing security and performance metrics in AI deployment pipelines.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design and implement a standardized environmental impact assessment framework that plugs into existing AI development pipelines on embedded devices. The framework will extend model evaluation metrics (MSE/MAE) and security metrics (TLS/SSL) with carbon footprint estimates based on energy consumption data during training and inference, model size, and hardware utilization profiling. It will integrate lifecycle assessment methodologies to provide end-to-end sustainability evaluation and support decision making by developers.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets from IoT and industrial load forecasting benchmarks.\n2. Develop or adopt energy profiling tools for single-board computers.\n3. Implement environmental impact assessment module combining energy data with lifecycle assessment standards.\n4. Integrate proposed framework with AI pipelines securing data transmission via TLS/SSL.\n5. Evaluate framework using metrics including MSE, MAE, carbon footprint, and security overhead.\n6. Compare results against baseline AI systems without sustainability integration.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Load forecasting model training on Raspberry Pi with real-time electricity usage logged.\nExpected Output: Model performance report that includes prediction accuracy, energy consumption (in joules), and an estimated carbon footprint (kg CO2e), alongside security compliance metrics.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct energy measurement is infeasible, use hardware simulation or look-up tables for power estimation. If lifecycle assessment integration proves too complex, start with operational phase impact only and extend gradually."

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan lacks clarity on how energy profiling tools will be validated for accuracy on diverse single-board computers beyond Raspberry Pi, and how lifecycle assessment integration will be quantitatively operationalized. It is important to explicitly define validation protocols for the energy measurement methodology, ensure reproducibility across hardware, and detail the lifecycle assessment standards adopted. Furthermore, integrating security metrics (TLS/SSL) with environmental metrics is outlined but not substantiated with an evaluation methodology that quantifies trade-offs or overhead comprehensively. Strengthening these aspects will make the experimental plan more scientifically robust and feasible for deployment in real-world AI edge scenarios, avoiding underestimating measurement or integration challenges that might impede the framework’s adoption or accuracy assessment at scale. Specifically, consider a pilot energy measurement validation phase with multi-hardware setups and a clear mapping of lifecycle assessment components to measurable system parameters from training to deployment stages. Also, outline methods to quantify the impact of security protocols on energy consumption and carbon footprint to validate the claim of combining sustainability with security metrics meaningfully in the pipeline integration step.  This will substantially increase confidence in the feasibility of the complete framework implementation and evaluation strategy as presented in the Experiment Plan section.  Targeted elaboration here would reduce risk of experimental failure or incompleteness before committing resources to full-scale implementation and evaluation cycles, aligning closely with the problem statement’s emphasis on end-to-end environmental impact transparency in edge AI systems.   Additionally, clarify how fallback plans such as simulation or lookup tables will be validated to ensure they provide credible approximations, so the framework remains practical even if direct measurements are constrained. This careful attention to experimental feasibility will greatly strengthen the work's foundation and credibility in the AI research community.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "To enhance both novelty and impact, integrate concepts from 'mobile edge computing' and 'smart city solutions'—leveraging environmental impact assessments within broader real-world edge AI deployments beyond isolated device scenarios. By demonstrating how the proposed framework can embed into mobile edge computing infrastructures that underpin smart city applications (e.g., traffic forecasting, distributed sensor networks), the work can address scalability and contextual dynamics of energy use and carbon footprint in urban AI systems. Coupling environmental metrics with data privacy/security protocols already prevalent in smart city data flows would also ground the research in a high-impact, multidisciplinary domain, increasing practical relevance and cross-community interest. Furthermore, incorporating network digital twin techniques could enhance the framework’s lifecycle assessment by simulating and optimizing energy usage patterns across aggregated edge devices, contributing to smarter sustainability-aware system design. This integration capitalizes on the global trend toward sustainable smart city development and next-generation wireless technologies (beyond-5G), providing a compelling scenario where edge AI sustainability metrics directly influence infrastructure decisions and policy. Such an extension would differentiate the contribution in a competitive research area by positioning it at the intersection of edge AI, sustainability, and intelligent urban environments—amplifying impact, usability, and novelty beyond a single-device carbon footprint measurement tool.
