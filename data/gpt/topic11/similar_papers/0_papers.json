    "abstract": "Foundation Models (FMs) are gaining increasing attention in the biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem due to their ability to represent and contextualize multimodal biomedical data. These capabilities make FMs a valuable tool for a variety of tasks, including biomedical reasoning, hypothesis generation, and interpreting complex imaging data. In this review paper, we address the unique challenges associated with establishing an ethical and trustworthy biomedical AI ecosystem, with a particular focus on the development of FMs and their downstream applications. We explore strategies that can be implemented throughout the biomedical AI pipeline to effectively tackle these challenges, ensuring that these FMs are translated responsibly into clinical and translational settings. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of key stewardship and co-design principles that not only ensure robust regulation but also guarantee that the interests of all stakeholders-especially those involved in or affected by these clinical and translational applications-are adequately represented. We aim to empower the biomedical AI community to harness these models responsibly and effectively. As we navigate this exciting frontier, our collective commitment to ethical stewardship, co-design, and responsible translation will be instrumental in ensuring that the evolution of FMs truly enhances patient care and medical decision-making, ultimately leading to a more equitable and trustworthy biomedical AI ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Health disparities among marginalized populations with lower socioeconomic status significantly impact the fairness and effectiveness of healthcare delivery. The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare presents an opportunity to address these inequalities, provided that AI models are free from bias. This paper aims to address the bias challenges by population disparities within healthcare systems, existing in the presentation of and development of algorithms, leading to inequitable medical implementation for conditions such as pulmonary embolism (PE) prognosis. In this study, we explore the diverse bias in healthcare systems, which highlights the demand for a holistic framework to reducing bias by complementary aggregation. By leveraging de-biasing deep survival prediction models, we propose a framework that disentangles identifiable information from images, text reports, and clinical variables to mitigate potential biases within multimodal datasets. Our study offers several advantages over traditional clinical-based survival prediction methods, including richer survival-related characteristics and bias-complementary predicted results. By improving the robustness of survival analysis through this framework, we aim to benefit patients, clinicians, and researchers by enhancing fairness and accuracy in healthcare AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Predictive models in biomedicine need to ensure equitable and reliable outcomes for the populations they are applied to. Unfortunately, biases in medical predictions can lead to unfair treatment and widening disparities, underscoring the need for effective techniques to address these issues. To enhance fairness, we introduce a framework based on a Multiple Domain Adversarial Neural Network (MDANN), which incorporates multiple adversarial components. In an MDANN, an adversarial module is applied to learn a fair pattern by negative gradients back-propagating across multiple sensitive features (i.e., characteristics of individuals that should not be used to discriminate unfairly between individuals when making predictions or decisions.) We leverage loss functions based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) to address the class imbalance, promoting equitable classification performance for minority groups (e.g., a subset of the population that is underrepresented or disadvantaged.) Moreover, we utilize pre-trained convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) to extract deep representations of data, aiming to enhance prediction accuracy and fairness. Combining these mechanisms, we alleviate biases and disparities to provide reliable and equitable disease prediction. We empirically demonstrate that the MDANN approach leads to better accuracy and fairness in predicting disease progression using brain imaging data for Alzheimer's Disease and Autism populations than state-of-the-art techniques.",

    "abstract": "This survey explores the transformative impact of foundation models (FMs) in artificial intelligence, focusing on their integration with federated learning (FL) in biomedical research. Foundation models such as ChatGPT, LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and multimodal patient interactions. The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges, and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs and FL, laying the groundwork for healthcare innovations.",

    "abstract": "In healthcare, the development and deployment of insufficiently fair systems of artificial intelligence (AI) can undermine the delivery of equitable care. Assessments of AI models stratified across subpopulations have revealed inequalities in how patients are diagnosed, treated and billed. In this Perspective, we outline fairness in machine learning through the lens of healthcare, and discuss how algorithmic biases (in data acquisition, genetic variation and intra-observer labelling variability, in particular) arise in clinical workflows and the resulting healthcare disparities. We also review emerging technology for mitigating biases via disentanglement, federated learning and model explainability, and their role in the development of AI-based software as a medical device.",

    "abstract": "Although artificial intelligence (AI) methods hold promise for medical imaging-based prediction tasks, their integration into medical practice may present a double-edged sword due to bias (i.e., systematic errors). AI algorithms have the potential to mitigate cognitive biases in human interpretation, but extensive research has highlighted the tendency of AI systems to internalize biases within their model. This fact, whether intentional or not, may ultimately lead to unintentional consequences in the clinical setting, potentially compromising patient outcomes. This concern is particularly important in medical imaging, where AI has been more progressively and widely embraced than any other medical field. A comprehensive understanding of bias at each stage of the AI pipeline is therefore essential to contribute to developing AI solutions that are not only less biased but also widely applicable. This international collaborative review effort aims to increase awareness within the medical imaging community about the importance of proactively identifying and addressing AI bias to prevent its negative consequences from being realized later. The authors began with the fundamentals of bias by explaining its different definitions and delineating various potential sources. Strategies for detecting and identifying bias were then outlined, followed by a review of techniques for its avoidance and mitigation. Moreover, ethical dimensions, challenges encountered, and prospects were discussed.",

    "abstract": "The pace of artificial intelligence (AI) integration into health care has accelerated with rapid advances in generative AI (genAI). Gastroenterology and hepatology in particular will be transformed due to the multimodal workflows that integrate endoscopic video, radiologic imaging, tabular data, and unstructured note text. GenAI will impact the entire spectrum of clinical experience, from administrative tasks, diagnostic guidance, and treatment recommendations. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, genAI is more flexible, with one platform able to be used across multiple tasks. Initial evidence suggests benefits in lower-level administrative tasks, such as clinical documentation, medical billing, and scheduling; and information tasks, such as patient education and summarization of the medical literature. No evidence exists for genAI solutions for more complex tasks relevant to clinical care, such as clinical reasoning for diagnostic and treatment decisions that may affect patient outcomes. Challenges of output reliability, data privacy, and useful integration remain; potential solutions include robust validation, regulatory oversight, and \"human-AI teaming\" strategies to ensure safe, effective deployment. We remain optimistic in the potential of genAI to augment clinical expertise due to the adaptability of genAI to handle multiple data modalities to obtain and focus relevant information flows and the human-friendly interfaces that facilitate ease of use. We believe that the potential of genAI for dynamic human-algorithmic interactions may allow for a degree of clinician-directed customization to enhance human presence.",

    "abstract": "In an era of rapid technological advancements, generative artificial intelligence and foundation models are reshaping industries and offering new advanced solutions in a wide range of scientific areas, particularly in public and environmental health. However, foundation models have previously mostly focused on understanding and generating text, while geospatial features, interrelations, flows and correlations have been neglected. Thus, this paper outlines the importance of research into Geospatial Foundation Models, which have the potential to revolutionise digital health surveillance and public health. We examine the latest advances, opportunities, challenges, and ethical considerations of geospatial foundation models for research and applications in digital health. We focus on the specific challenges of integrating geospatial context with foundation models and lay out the future potential for multimodal geospatial foundation models for a variety of research avenues in digital health surveillance and health assessment.",

    "year": 2025,

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, enabling advances in diagnostics, treatment optimization, and patient care. Yet, its integration raises ethical, regulatory, and societal challenges. Key concerns include data privacy risks, algorithmic bias, and regulatory gaps that struggle to keep pace with AI advancements. This study aims to synthesize a multidisciplinary framework for trustworthy AI in healthcare, focusing on transparency, accountability, fairness, sustainability, and global collaboration. It moves beyond high-level ethical discussions to provide actionable strategies for implementing trustworthy AI in clinical contexts. <b>Methods</b>: A structured literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies were selected based on relevance to AI ethics, governance, and policy in healthcare, prioritizing peer-reviewed articles, policy analyses, case studies, and ethical guidelines from authoritative sources published within the last decade. The conceptual approach integrates perspectives from clinicians, ethicists, policymakers, and technologists, offering a holistic \"<i>ecosystem</i>\" view of AI. No clinical trials or patient-level interventions were conducted. <b>Results</b>: The analysis identifies key gaps in current AI governance and introduces the <i>Regulatory Genome</i>-an adaptive AI oversight framework aligned with global policy trends and Sustainable Development Goals. It introduces quantifiable trustworthiness metrics, a comparative analysis of AI categories for clinical applications, and bias mitigation strategies. Additionally, it presents interdisciplinary policy recommendations for aligning AI deployment with ethical, regulatory, and environmental sustainability goals. This study emphasizes measurable standards, multi-stakeholder engagement strategies, and global partnerships to ensure that future AI innovations meet ethical and practical healthcare needs. <b>Conclusions</b>: Trustworthy AI in healthcare requires more than technical advancements-it demands robust ethical safeguards, proactive regulation, and continuous collaboration. By adopting the recommended roadmap, stakeholders can foster responsible innovation, improve patient outcomes, and maintain public trust in AI-driven healthcare.",
