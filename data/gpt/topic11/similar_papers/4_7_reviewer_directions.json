    "title": "Risk Mitigation Behavior Modeling for AI Moderation Feedback Loops",
    "Problem_Statement": "AI moderation systems lack mechanisms to model and incentivize user risk mitigation behaviors, reducing effectiveness in fostering ethical posting over time.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external gap by transplanting risk mitigation behavior models from biomedical ethics to inform AI feedback and engagement strategies dynamically, improving fairness and user outcomes.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a computational model of risk mitigation behaviors reflecting users’ adaptive strategies after encountering moderation. Incorporate this into feedback systems within moderation tools to offer tailored guidance, rewards, and transparency to encourage ethical user behavior.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Survey and model common risk mitigation behaviors from user data post-moderation. 2. Integrate model into moderation feedback loops using reinforcement learning to personalize user guidance. 3. Evaluate changes in user compliance, stress, and trust metrics over time.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User frequently re-phrases borderline content. Expected Output: System recognizes risk mitigation and provides positive feedback via transparency notices encouraging ethical improvement.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If modeling accuracy is low, employ simpler rule-based detection of mitigation attempts to bootstrap system and collect more data."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines developing a computational model to reflect users' adaptive risk mitigation behaviors and incorporating this into moderation feedback loops, but it lacks clarity on how these adaptive strategies are precisely modeled, what specific features or behavioral signals will be used, and how reinforcement learning personalization will operate within the feedback system. Clarify the mechanism of modeling risk mitigation behavior and detail how the reinforcement learning component will dynamically tailor feedback while ensuring system stability and fairness. This will strengthen the methodological soundness and reproducibility of the approach and ensure that the proposed system can effectively detect and incentivize ethical behavior changes as intended. Provide formal definitions or examples of risk mitigation behavior detection and how feedback adjustments will be decided algorithmically in response to user adaptations within the system's loop."

          "feedback_content": "To enhance both impact and novelty, consider integrating insights and evaluation metrics related to mental health outcomes — for example, measuring how the proposed risk mitigation feedback loops in AI moderation influence user stress and trust over time, explicitly linking to cognitive load theory or mental health metrics. Incorporating human-computer interaction principles and potentially leveraging adaptive learning system frameworks could deepen the personalization aspect. Such integration can position the work within broader AI system adaptation and human-robot interaction fields, making the idea both more interdisciplinary and impactful by addressing not just ethical posting but also user well-being and mental health, thus broadening the scope and relevance to real-world digital platform challenges."
