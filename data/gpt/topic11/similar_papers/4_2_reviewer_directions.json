    "title": "Biomedical Ethics Inspired Stress-Responsive Moderation Adjustment",
    "Problem_Statement": "User stress caused by AI moderation negatively impacts user experience, but current frameworks lack mechanisms to detect and adapt to stress in real time.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap regarding operationalized linkages between negative user experience and ethical compliance by importing biomedical stress detection and mitigation methodologies into moderation systems.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement a real-time user stress detection system using physiological signals (e.g., heart rate via smart devices) or behavioral indicators (typing speed, language tone), triggering adaptive moderation interventions designed to reduce user stress ethically and fairly.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multimodal datasets linking physiological and behavioral stress markers to moderation interactions. 2. Build stress detection classifiers validated against user self-reports. 3. Integrate stress feedback loop into LLM moderation, enabling adaptive response strategies (e.g., soft warnings, delay in penalty). 4. Evaluate reductions in stress metrics and fairness perceptions versus static moderation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User exhibiting increased typing latency and stressed language after receiving multiple flags. Expected Output: Moderation system adjusts its enforcement to a gentler tone, offers additional explanations and suggests breaks to mitigate stress.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If physiological data is unavailable, rely solely on behavioral proxies or self-reporting prompts. Analyze which proxies most reliably correlate with stress for future enhancement."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks clarity and concrete details on data collection protocols and ethical safeguards, especially given the sensitive nature of physiological and behavioral stress data collection. The plan should specify methods for obtaining informed consent, ensuring privacy, and managing variability in physiological signals across different users and contexts. Additionally, operationalizing real-time stress detection and integration into an LLM moderation system poses complex engineering challenges that are not sufficiently addressed. Providing a more detailed experimental design with pilot study descriptions, validation metrics, and safety measures will improve feasibility and strengthen the paper’s contribution potential while ensuring ethical compliance and user trust is maintained throughout experimentation and deployment phases. This is critical before proceeding further with implementation and evaluation phases described in steps 2 through 4, as failure to address these may cause ethical and practical pitfalls inhibiting reproducibility and adoption of the method in real applications, especially in sensitive settings like biomedical ethics and AI moderation contexts.\n\nWe urge the authors to include a robust experimental methodology detailing how multimodal data will be collected, labeled, and validated, particularly focusing on ethical standards and feasibility of real-time detection systems in diverse user environments, to convincingly demonstrate their approach’s viability and scientific rigor in these critical respects. This would make the research foundation substantially more solid and credible with regard to practical deployment constraints and responsible AI principles applied in biomedical ethics context moderation scenarios, a domain requiring stringent reliability and fairness considerations and transparent operational protocols rather than just high-level conceptual descriptions currently provided. A detailed discussion of fallback scenarios and their evaluation criteria should also be included to complete the feasibility case efficiently. This feedback targets the Experiment_Plan section specifically for enhancement to avoid major execution risks later on, prompted by the strong impact goal yet high domain sensitive concerns intrinsic to this biomedical ethics-inspired moderation domain, and mitigates the risk of unanticipated failures from oversimplified experimental planning assumptions, thus enhancing soundness and practical impact synergy for this highly competitive domain research idea (novelty rating: NOV-COMPETITIVE)."

          "feedback_content": "To enhance both the novelty and impact, we recommend integrating insights and methodologies from the globally-linked concepts related to mental health services and precision mental health, such as concepts from mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and cognitive therapy applied in user stress contexts. Specifically, you could explore adapting or incorporating cognitive therapy techniques or mindfulness interventions triggered by detected stress signals within the moderation system’s adaptive responses. This would not only ground your adaptive moderation strategies in evidence-based mental health practices but also differentiate your approach from existing AI moderation systems by combining biomedical ethics with clinically validated mental health interventions.\n\nFor instance, consider integrating short, guided mindfulness prompts or cognitive reframing messages personalized to users’ detected stress patterns, which have been shown in research (including MBCT) to effectively reduce stress and improve user engagement and fairness perception. This approach could also facilitate cross-disciplinary collaboration and expand the scope from mere behavioral adjustment to therapeutic ethical moderation, thereby broadening the impact beyond moderation policy enforcement to user well-being enhancement, a critical emerging frontier in AI ethics and mental health technology.\n\nThis suggestion aims particularly at the Proposed_Method and Test_Case_Examples sections, encouraging an alignment with contemporary mental health service methodologies as a pathway to increase both the practical usability and scientific originality of your system in an otherwise highly competitive landscape, strengthening your contribution’s interdisciplinary depth and appeal."
