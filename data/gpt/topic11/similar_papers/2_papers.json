    "abstract": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have raised concerns about the ethical, moral, and legal safeguards. There is a pressing need to improve metrics for assessing security and privacy of AI systems and to manage AI technology in a more ethical manner. To address these challenges, an AI Trust Framework and Maturity Model is proposed to enhance trust in the design and management of AI systems. Trust in AI involves an agreed-upon understanding between humans and machines about system performance. The framework utilizes an \"entropy lens\" to root the study in information theory and enhance transparency and trust in \"black box\" AI systems, which lack ethical guardrails. High entropy in AI systems can decrease human trust, particularly in uncertain and competitive environments. The research draws inspiration from entropy studies to improve trust and performance in autonomous human-machine teams and systems, including interconnected elements in hierarchical systems. Applying this lens to improve trust in AI also highlights new opportunities to optimize performance in teams. Two use cases are described to validate the AI framework's ability to measure trust in the design and management of AI systems.",

    "abstract": "As healthcare systems around the world face challenges such as escalating costs, limited access, and growing demand for personalized care, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a key force for transformation. This review is motivated by the urgent need to harness AI's potential to mitigate these issues and aims to critically assess AI's integration in different healthcare domains. We explore how AI empowers clinical decision-making, optimizes hospital operation and management, refines medical image analysis, and revolutionizes patient care and monitoring through AI-powered wearables. Through several case studies, we review how AI has transformed specific healthcare domains and discuss the remaining challenges and possible solutions. Additionally, we will discuss methodologies for assessing AI healthcare solutions, ethical challenges of AI deployment, and the importance of data privacy and bias mitigation for responsible technology use. By presenting a critical assessment of AI's transformative potential, this review equips researchers with a deeper understanding of AI's current and future impact on healthcare. It encourages an interdisciplinary dialogue between researchers, clinicians, and technologists to navigate the complexities of AI implementation, fostering the development of AI-driven solutions that prioritize ethical standards, equity, and a patient-centered approach.",

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of image-based applications in various domains, the need for accurate and interpretable image similarity measures has become increasingly critical. Existing image similarity models often lack transparency, making it challenging to understand the reasons why two images are considered similar. In this paper, we propose the concept of explainable image similarity, where the goal is the development of an approach, which is capable of providing similarity scores along with visual factual and counterfactual explanations. Along this line, we present a new framework, which integrates Siamese Networks and Grad-CAM for providing explainable image similarity and discuss the potential benefits and challenges of adopting this approach. In addition, we provide a comprehensive discussion about factual and counterfactual explanations provided by the proposed framework for assisting decision making. The proposed approach has the potential to enhance the interpretability, trustworthiness and user acceptance of image-based systems in real-world image similarity applications.",

    "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the interpretation of orthopedic X-rays has shown great potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of fracture diagnosis. AI algorithms rely on large datasets of annotated images to learn how to accurately classify and diagnose abnormalities. One way to improve AI interpretation of X-rays is to increase the size and quality of the datasets used for training, and to incorporate more advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning, into the algorithms. Another approach is to integrate AI algorithms with other imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to provide a more comprehensive and accurate diagnosis. Recent studies have shown that AI algorithms can accurately detect and classify fractures of the wrist and long bones on X-ray images, demonstrating the potential of AI to improve the accuracy and efficiency of fracture diagnosis. These findings suggest that AI has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in the field of orthopedics.",

    "abstract": "As digital healthcare evolves, the security of electronic health records (EHR) becomes increasingly crucial. This study presents the GPT-Onto-CAABAC framework, integrating Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT), medical-legal ontologies and Context-Aware Attribute-Based Access Control (CAABAC) to enhance EHR access security. Unlike traditional models, GPT-Onto-CAABAC dynamically interprets policies and adapts to changing healthcare and legal environments, offering customized access control solutions. Through empirical evaluation, this framework is shown to be effective in improving EHR security by accurately aligning access decisions with complex regulatory and situational requirements. The findings suggest its broader applicability in sectors where access control must meet stringent compliance and adaptability standards.",

    "year": 2025,
    "citationCount": 14,
    "fieldCitationRatio": NaN,
    "abstract": "Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies-such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks-to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows-namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity-critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.",
