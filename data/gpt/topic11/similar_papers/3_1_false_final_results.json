    "title": "Energy-Aware Neural Architecture Search for Sustainable Edge AI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current neural architectures for load forecasting and anomaly detection are optimized primarily for accuracy, neglecting energy consumption impact during training and inference, which hinders sustainable AI deployment on resource-constrained devices.",
    "Motivation": "This idea confronts the internal gap by developing a method to co-optimize model performance and energy efficiency, advancing Opportunity 2 from the innovation map. By leveraging hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS), it targets the environmental cost during full AI lifecycle.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-objective NAS framework that searches for neural network architectures balancing forecasting accuracy with energy consumption measured dynamically on real edge hardware. The framework incorporates real-time energy profiling feedback loops during search iterations and adapts architectures to hardware constraints and environmental metrics.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select datasets for load forecasting and anomaly detection.\n2. Deploy measurement tools on single-board computers to record energy usage.\n3. Implement multi-objective NAS optimizing for accuracy and energy profile.\n4. Compare found architectures to state-of-the-art models on metrics: MSE, MAE, energy consumption, and carbon footprint estimate.\n5. Analyze trade-offs and identify efficient model families for deployment.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Historical electrical load data.\nOutput: Forecasting model with 5% improved prediction accuracy and 30% reduced energy usage compared to baseline models, reported with energy consumption logs and environmental impact scores.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time energy profiling is noisy, use proxy models to estimate consumption. If NAS is too computationally expensive, reduce search space or use surrogate models for approximations."
