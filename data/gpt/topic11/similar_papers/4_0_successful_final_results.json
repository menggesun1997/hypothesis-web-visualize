        "title": "Ethical Psychological Profiling for Personalized AI Moderation with Enhanced Validity and Privacy Guarantees",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM-driven moderation systems apply uniform policies without accounting adequately for users' psychological and ethical predispositions, leading to suboptimal outcomes like increased user stress, perceptions of unfairness, and reduced trust. Although personalization promises improvement, reliably and ethically profiling users remains a complex challenge due to trait variability, cultural differences, privacy concerns, and risks of bias.",
        "Motivation": "This work aims to fill a critical internal gap by rigorously grounding psychological and ethical profiling in validated instruments and robust privacy frameworks, thus enabling ethically responsible, culturally aware, and dynamic personalization in AI moderation. While prior systems have incorporated behavioral signals, our approach differentiates itself by integrating state-of-the-art psychological assessment methods, privacy-enhancing technologies, and active user engagement protocols. Furthermore, it bridges micro-level user psychology with macro-level ethical AI principles via a novel adaptive framework. This dual emphasis addresses both method soundness and user acceptance, overcoming the novelty-competitiveness challenge through methodological rigor and ethical innovation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an adaptive moderation framework that profiles users' psychological and ethical traits through a multi-modal approach combining short, validated psychometric questionnaires with unobtrusive behavioral analysis, all conducted under strict informed consent and leveraging privacy-enhancing technologies such as differential privacy and secure multi-party computation to protect user data. Our psychological instruments are drawn from recent peer-reviewed scales with cultural adaptability, supplemented by dynamic user cluster analyses reflecting interaction patterns. Moderation policies then adapt through a multi-armed bandit algorithm balancing user well-being, fairness, and platform goals, allowing continuous learning and personalization. The system actively involves ethical AI governance consultation, user feedback loops, and transparency measures to align with global privacy and ethics guidelines. This holistic method ensures that psychological profiling is valid, culturally sensitive, privacy-protected, and pragmatically implementable to improve moderation outcomes without sacrificing user autonomy or trust.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collaborate with ethical AI experts to refine profiling instruments and consent protocols ensuring cross-cultural validity and ethical compliance. 2. Collect a diverse, voluntary dataset combining anonymized social media interactions, validated psychological assessments, and metadata under privacy-enhanced methods. 3. Develop LLM-based moderation agents augmented with real-time adaptive personalization driven by multi-armed bandit algorithms balancing personalized strictness and fairness. 4. Evaluate outcomes against generic moderation baselines through metrics including stress biomarkers, complaint frequency, perceived fairness scales, and trust surveys. 5. Conduct ablation studies isolating psychological profiling impact and privacy mechanism overhead. 6. Implement iterative user studies to validate user acceptance and adjust informed consent and explanation interfaces. 7. Analyze potential bias and cultural disparities, refining profiling and moderation strategies accordingly.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A culturally diverse user cohort voluntarily completes a brief ethics and personality questionnaire followed by platform engagement. A user with high risk-aversion scores and strong fairness ethics posts borderline content. \nExpected Output: The LLM moderation system provides a personalized, transparent, and educative warning message, citing rationale tailored to the user's ethical profile and cultural context, dynamically adjusting communication style to reduce stress and enhance trust while ensuring compliance. User feedback confirms improved perceived fairness, lower stress reports, and higher trust scores compared to non-personalized models.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If personalized profiling fails to demonstrate clear improvement or raises ethical/acceptance concerns, we will (1) pivot to solely leveraging unsupervised clustering of interaction patterns combined with multi-armed bandit personalization for moderation without explicit psychological inputs, (2) intensify user-centric design studies to refine consent and transparency, and (3) incorporate more subtle implicit behavioral signals validated through longitudinal analysis. Additionally, we will perform comprehensive error and bias analyses to iterate profiling questionnaires and reinforce privacy methods. This ensures research impact and ethical integrity are maintained even if full profiling adoption is not feasible in deployment contexts."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that psychological and ethical profiling can be reliably and ethically performed via anonymized questionnaires and behavioral analysis needs stronger justification and grounding. Psychological traits and ethical predispositions are complex, context-dependent, and may not be stable enough to guide AI moderation effectively without introducing bias or privacy concerns. Clarify how you will ensure robust, valid, and ethically sound profiling, especially considering variability across cultural and situational contexts, and potential user resistance to profiling for moderation purposes. Inclusion of privacy-enhancing technologies and clear informed consent protocols should be elaborated to support this assumption validly within the method section and ethical considerations framework. This is critical to avoid harm from mischaracterization or profiling errors, which could worsen user experience and trust rather than improve it. Consider grounding the profiling approach in existing validated psychological instruments and ethical profiling literature to reinforce this assumption's soundness and ethical feasibility in real-world deployment contexts, given the sensitive nature of personalized moderation systems and user autonomy concerns. Without this, the foundational premise risks being unrealistic or ethically problematic, undermining the entire framework's effectiveness and acceptance within diverse user populations and platforms at scale. Addressing this assumption thoroughly will strengthen the credibility and trustworthiness of the proposed approach and help anticipate implementation challenges early on in your design and evaluation stages, making the research more robust and impactful overall.  \n\nSuggested Action: Add detailed discussion of ethical, cultural, and privacy considerations of profiling in Proposed_Method, and justify psychological assessment methods with recent high-quality literature to bolster validity and address ethical risk upfront. Conduct proactive engagement with ethical AI guidelines and possibly experts during approach refinement and user study design phases, ensuring these assumptions are critically examined and transparently communicated in the final methodology and user interaction design phases to build trust and efficacy in real deployment scenarios with diverse global users. This will also prepare you well to address peer reviewer concerns on ethical soundness and user data sensitivity in top-tier venues like ACL or NeurIPS. This critique must be addressed before proceeding further with implementation or experiments to avoid foundational methodological flaws and ethical risks that compromise soundness and feasibility simultaneously, as these are intertwined in this domain and setup.  \n\nIn sum, re-examine and elaborate the feasibility and validity of psychological and ethical profiling assumptions underpinning your moderation personalization approach for soundness, ethics, user acceptance, and bias mitigation upfront in your proposal and experiments plan to ensure real-world impact and integrity of your system.  \n\n\n---\n\n[SOU-ASSUMPTION] must be remedied as top priority for this work's success and acceptance at a premier venue requiring rigorous, ethically responsible AI research outcomes in sensitive, user-centric environments like content moderation mediated by LLMs and user psychology integration.
