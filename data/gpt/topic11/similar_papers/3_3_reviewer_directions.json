    "title": "Lifecycle Carbon Footprint Database for AI Model Training and Deployment",
    "Problem_Statement": "A major barrier to integrating environmental impact into AI pipelines is the absence of standardized, detailed carbon footprint data covering the entire lifecycle of AI model training and deployment stages, particularly for edge computing scenarios.",
    "Motivation": "This idea focuses on the external gap of missing lifecycle analysis integration by creating an open-access, comprehensive carbon footprint database tailored for AI operations across hardware types and usage patterns, enabling more accurate sustainability assessments and greener AI design.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Collect and curate real-world measurements and estimates for carbon emissions related to energy sources, hardware manufacturing, model training/inference energy profiles, and disposal. Develop standardized APIs and tools to query and integrate this data into AI pipelines, supporting carbon-aware optimization and reporting.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collaborate with data centers and hardware manufacturers to obtain energy and emission data.\n2. Aggregate IoT and edge device consumption patterns.\n3. Build database schema and accessible querying tools.\n4. Pilot database integration in existing AI model assessment workflows.\n5. Validate database accuracy and utility through case studies, comparing environmental metrics before and after adoption.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Query for carbon emission impact of training a transformer model on Raspberry Pi using grid electricity.\nOutput: Detailed report including estimated kWh consumption, associated CO2 equivalent emissions, embedded emissions from hardware manufacturing, and recommendations for reductions.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If data collection is limited, start with modeled estimates and gradually update with empirical data. Use crowdsourcing across institutions to expand dataset coverage."

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan depends heavily on collaboration with data centers and hardware manufacturers to access detailed energy and emission data, which might be challenging to secure given proprietary and privacy concerns. Additionally, aggregating consumption patterns from edge IoT devices could face scalability and heterogeneity issues, potentially delaying data collection and database completeness. It is recommended to augment the plan with intermediate milestones focused on less data-intensive proof-of-concept validations, employ simulation-based or publicly available datasets as complementary baselines initially, and explicitly address potential data access obstacles with contingency strategies to ensure feasibility and timely progress during development phases. Clarifying data validation protocols and standardization methods within highly variable edge environments would also strengthen feasibility assessments of the database’s utility and integration capabilities in diverse AI pipelines rather than relying mostly on empirical data collection success alone. This will help manage risk and demonstrate iterative value to potential collaborators or funders early on, increasing the project's feasibility and robustness in practice, thereby improving confidence in its progression towards impact delivery and adoption in the community. The Experiment_Plan section should be expanded to reflect these considerations coherently and pragmatically, establishing clearer fallback workflows and measurable intermediate objectives beyond the final validation case studies currently described, especially given the novelty screening notes competitive parallels which may pressure accelerated proof of dataset reliability and utility in prototyping phases to maintain interest and relevance in the field's fast-moving context. \n\nFurthermore, engaging crowdsourcing should be detailed further as either a parallel or backup strategy rather than a fallback, with a structured pipeline and quality control to maximize data reliability and representativeness, given the high variability of device types and operational contexts, explicitly articulated in the Experiment_Plan to enhance overall project manageability and feasibility."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "To enhance both the impact and perceived novelty of the project, consider integrating knowledge and methods from the sustainable development strategy domain, particularly by linking the database with corporate green investment and business model innovation frameworks. Leveraging such connections can transform the database from a purely technical tool into a strategic asset that informs sustainability-oriented decision-making capabilities across AI industry stakeholders, data center operators, and energy providers. For example, integrating lifecycle carbon footprint data with supply chain performance metrics or green investment evaluation models could facilitate more comprehensive assessments that encourage companies to optimize resource use and promote greener AI product development paths. Additionally, tying in information transparency practices or embedding the database into broader industry ecosystems focusing on lowering environmental impacts may attract interdisciplinary interest and reinforce the system’s adoption beyond pure technical audiences. Engaging with these globally linked topics will not only help differentiate the work from competing efforts but also position the project as a cornerstone component in advancing sustainable AI at the intersection of technology, business, and policy, thereby increasing the societal and practical impact envisioned in the proposal."
