    "title": "Educational Ethics-Inspired Interactive Transparency Module",
    "Problem_Statement": "AI moderation transparency currently centers around technical explainability, insufficiently engaging users in ethical understanding, limiting user empowerment and trust.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to critical external gap by applying educational ethics principles to foster ongoing user education and ethical engagement as a form of operationalized transparency in LLM-driven moderation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an interactive transparency interface that educates users about moderation decisions through layered ethical narratives, case studies, and risk mitigation scenarios inspired by educational ethics curricula. The module adapts content based on user responses, promoting ethical literacy and reducing negative user reactions.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop curriculum-based transparency content referencing real moderation cases. 2. Integrate into a moderation dashboard as an interactive module. 3. Pilot with social media users undergoing moderated content flags. 4. Measure changes in perceived fairness, trust, and knowledge retention versus standard opaque or static explanations. 5. Refine adaptivity rules based on feedback loops.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User receives notification with flagged content. Expected Output: Transparency module presents an explanation framed with ethical principles, invites user to view a short educational vignette, and offers suggestions for risk mitigation behaviors in future posts.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If users find the module too complex or avoid interaction, simplify content to bite-sized key points or integrate gamified ethical quizzes to boost engagement."

          "feedback_content": "The design of the interactive transparency interface, while conceptually appealing, lacks a detailed explanation of how the system effectively adapts educational ethics content based on user responses. Clarify the mechanisms for real-time adaptivity: for instance, how user inputs are interpreted, how content layers are modulated, and how ethical literacy gains are measured dynamically. Without this clarity, it is difficult to evaluate the plausibility and reliability of the method in practice. Provide more explicit algorithmic or interface design frameworks to demonstrate soundness of the mechanism beyond conceptual description, possibly drawing on existing adaptive learning or human-computer interaction models linked to ethical training contexts, ensuring robustness of the method's operation and its user experience impact assessment in the experimental phase.\n\nFurthermore, specify how the ethical narratives and risk mitigation scenarios will be consistently linked to AI moderation decisions to avoid perceived dissonance or over-complexity for diverse user groups and content types."

          "feedback_content": "To enhance both the novelty and impact of the educational ethics-inspired transparency module, consider integrating concepts from 'organizational justice effect' and 'psychological safety' derived from the globally linked concepts. Specifically, you can expand the module to explicitly measure and promote perceived organizational justice through the transparency interface, thereby fostering psychological safety among users of social media platforms. This can involve embedding interactive elements that allow users to voice concerns or feedback about moderation fairness, which in turn could be analyzed using partial least squares techniques to model their continuous usage intention and trust. This integration would not only broaden the potential application of the module beyond individual ethical literacy to organizational and community-level effects, but also situate the research in a multidisciplinary framework that could meaningfully differentiate it within the competitive space."
