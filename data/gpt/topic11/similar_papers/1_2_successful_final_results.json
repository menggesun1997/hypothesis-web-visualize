    "title": "Quantum-Secured Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intrusion Detection in LLM Deployments",
    "Problem_Statement": "Entrenching model security for LLM deployment in financial services is difficult due to evolving cyber threats and the need for dynamic real-time intrusion detection mechanisms that guarantee privacy and secure key exchanges.",
    "Motivation": "Fulfills the gap regarding real-time secure operations and model security by harnessing machine learning-driven security (deep reinforcement learning) combined with quantum key distribution to defend LLM environments dynamically against sophisticated intrusions.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a dynamic intrusion detection system for LLM deployment environments that uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents to learn adaptive defense strategies against attacks (e.g., data poisoning, adversarial queries). Integrate quantum key distribution (QKD) to secure communication channels and exchange of cryptographic keys, ensuring unbreakable encryption of model updates and telemetry, safeguarding from man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Simulate an LLM deployment environment with network traffic including benign and malicious patterns. 2) Implement DRL agents trained via policy gradient methods to detect and respond to anomalies. 3) Integrate a QKD emulator for secure key exchange between system components. 4) Baselines: static rule-based intrusion detection, DRL without QKD. 5) Metrics: detection accuracy, false positive rate, response latency, and communication security level.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Sample input: An adversary injecting subtle perturbations in query streams aiming to degrade model performance. Expected output: DRL agent detects anomaly pattern promptly, triggers defense protocols while QKD ensures secure communications remain uncompromised.",

        "title": "Edge-Cloud Collaborative Quantum-Secured Deep Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Intrusion Detection in LLM Deployments",
        "Problem_Statement": "Ensuring robust security for LLM deployments in financial services faces critical challenges from evolving cyber threats, especially adversarial machine learning attacks and data poisoning. Current defenses lack adaptive real-time intrusion detection with strong communication security in highly distributed network edge environments where LLM services increasingly reside, limiting scalability, latency effectiveness, and protection against complex multi-layer attacks.",
        "Motivation": "Bridging the gap between dynamic, intelligent defense mechanisms and secure communications, this work advances state-of-the-art by integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with quantum key distribution (QKD) within an edge-cloud collaborative computing framework. This approach enables scalable, context-aware, real-time attack detection and response that accounts for adversarial ML threat models and leverages physical layer security enhancements. By aligning with cybersecurity frameworks and extending applicability beyond finance to critical national infrastructure, the proposal elevates novelty and broadens impact over current static or siloed solutions.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid intrusion detection system (IDS) deploying DRL agents across network edges and cloud nodes to collaboratively learn adaptive defense policies against a comprehensive threat model, including adversarial ML attacks and data poisoning aimed at LLMs. The system integrates a realistically modeled QKD subsystem enhanced by physical layer security techniques to secure key exchanges and telemetry, accounting for quantum channel imperfections, limited key generation rates, and integration latency within a multi-layer network stack. Employ edge-cloud collaborative computing to reduce response latency and improve scalability, with DRL agents using multi-armed bandit algorithms for efficient exploration-exploitation in dynamic environments. The system will adhere to established cybersecurity frameworks and support critical infrastructure protection use cases beyond finance.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct a modular network simulation environment using NS3 combined with an advanced QKD emulator that realistically models quantum channel noise, key generation rates, and integration delays reflecting current hardware constraints. 2) Implement DRL agents with multi-armed bandit-based policy learning deployed at both edge and cloud layers, trained on network traffic datasets augmented with adversarial machine learning attack patterns targeting LLMs. 3) Integrate physical layer security techniques to enhance QKD link robustness within the simulated access and core networks. 4) Evaluate scalability by incrementally increasing network size and node count reflecting realistic edge-cloud LLM deployment scenarios. 5) Baseline comparison against static rule-based IDS and DRL-only systems without QKD or collaborative computing. 6) Metrics: detection accuracy, false positive rate, response latency, key exchange security levels, resource consumption, and adaptability to adversarial threat dynamics. 7) Conduct preliminary small-scale proof-of-concept experiments validating integration feasibility and resource profiles prior to full-scale simulation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An adversary performs a coordinated poisoning attack with subtle adversarial inputs distributed across edge nodes to degrade LLM inference over financial transaction data streams. Expected Output: DRL agents at the edge detect anomalies rapidly via collaborative learning with cloud nodes, initiating defense protocols. Simultaneously, QKD-secured communication prevents interception or tampering of model update messages despite channel noise. The system maintains low false alarms and bounded response latency, preserving LLM integrity and availability.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full-scale QKD integration proves infeasible at simulation scale, fallback to hybrid classical post-quantum cryptographic schemes combined with physical layer security enhancements will be evaluated. This will permit comparative analysis of security-performance trade-offs while maintaining core DRL-driven adaptive defense and collaborative computing architectures."

However, the feasibility of effectively simulating quantum key distribution — even with an emulator — within a complex LLM deployment and network traffic environment is insufficiently addressed. The proposal should clarify how the QKD emulator realistically models quantum channel imperfections, key generation rates, and integration latencies that might critically affect real-time detection and response. Additionally, scalability aspects and resource requirements for training DRL agents in such a dynamic environment need elaboration to ensure practical implementation rather than theoretical demonstration alone. Providing preliminary feasibility studies or smaller-scale proof-of-concept results would strengthen confidence in the experimental methodology and outcomes’ reliability. More detail on evaluation environments and simulation fidelity would enhance credibility and reproducibility prospects within the community, aligning well with contemporary network and security experimental standards (e.g., NS3 simulators). This clarification is crucial to ensure the experiment plan translates into actionable insights and stronger real-world applicability rather than remaining a conceptual framework with limited empirical validation potential.

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty screening verdict of NOV-COMPETITIVE, the idea would benefit significantly from a stronger interdisciplinary integration of related globally-linked concepts to boost impact and distinctiveness. For example, leveraging 'edge-cloud collaborative computing' and 'real-time attack detection' paradigms could position the work for deployment at the network edge where LLM services often reside, thus addressing latency and scalability challenges while enriching DRL agent context awareness. Incorporating 'adversarial machine learning attacks' explicitly into the threat model and adapting DRL strategies accordingly would increase robustness. Additionally, integrating insights from 'physical layer security' and 'AI systems' to enhance the QKD-enabled communication's interaction with network stack security would deepen the theoretical grounding and experimental novelty. Aligning with 'Critical Infrastructure Protection' and 'Cybersecurity Framework' standards could widen the framework’s adoption potential beyond financial services into other critical sectors. These synergistic combinations may turn the approach from a niche concept into a broadly applicable security paradigm with demonstrable advantages over competing methods, thus elevating its competitiveness in premier venues.
