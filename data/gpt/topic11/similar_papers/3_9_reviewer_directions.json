    "title": "Sustainable AI Benchmark Suite Incorporating Environmental Metrics for Edge Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of benchmark suites for AI workloads on edge devices that incorporate environmental impact metrics such as energy consumption, carbon footprint, and sustainability scores alongside traditional accuracy and security measures.",
    "Motivation": "This directly fills the internal gap by providing a comprehensive evaluation standard combining performance, security, and sustainability, fostering consistency in research and deployment assessments as called for in the research map.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a benchmark suite with standardized datasets, tasks (load forecasting, anomaly detection), security tests, and instrumentation for measuring environmental metrics on various hardware platforms. Provide open-source tools and leaderboards to encourage adoption.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate datasets and tasks relevant to edge AI.\n2. Implement measurement protocols for environmental impact.\n3. Integrate with existing security testing frameworks.\n4. Release baseline model implementations.\n5. Organize community challenges to incentivize sustainable AI model development.\n6. Analyze benchmark results to identify best practices.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Evaluation of a new load forecasting model on Raspberry Pi.\nOutput: Benchmark report detailing prediction accuracy, latency, security vulnerabilities, energy usage, and estimated carbon emission compared to established baselines.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If environmental data gathering is complex, start with simulated or estimated metrics with progress towards real measurements."
