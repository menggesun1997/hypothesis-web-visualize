    "title": "Multimodal Siamese Networks for Legal Text and Image Interpretability",
    "Problem_Statement": "Legal cases often involve documents combining text and images (e.g., contracts and signatures), yet explainability across these modalities remains unexplored.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of multimodal explainability and external hidden bridge connecting image explainability techniques with legal text analysis to form a cross-modal interpretability framework.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a Siamese network architecture that jointly embeds legal text and associated images (signatures, diagrams). The model produces similarity scores and aligned explanations using adapted Grad-CAM for images and token-level attention visualization for text.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect or synthesize multimodal legal case datasets.\n2) Implement baseline unimodal and multimodal models.\n3) Train Siamese multimodal network.\n4) Develop explanation system mapping cross-modal importance.\n5) Evaluate with multimodal retrieval tasks and explanation relevance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Contract clauses with signature images.\nOutput: Similarity score to precedent documents with aligned highlighted text and image regions explaining the basis of similarity.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal training stalls, pretrain unimodal encoders separately, then fine-tune multimodal fusion. Explore alternative explanation fusion strategies if initial methods lack clarity."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that there exists a meaningful and consistent alignment between legal text (e.g., contract clauses) and associated images (signatures, diagrams) for interpretability is not fully substantiated. While signatures can carry identifying information, their link to semantic content in legal text is often indirect, and diagrams in legal documents may vary widely in style and informativeness. The proposal should provide stronger justification or preliminary analysis that such multimodal alignment is significant, stable, and generalizable across legal cases to warrant a joint embedding approach. Without this, the foundation for using Siamese networks on these modalities risks being weak or domain-specific rather than broadly applicable in legal interpretability contexts, thereby affecting soundness and impact reliability. An initial exploratory study or citation of domain knowledge supporting this assumption is recommended to solidify the premise for the proposed multimodal framework and ensure the soundness of the approach is well grounded in domain reality and practice needs, beyond technical novelty alone. This clarification would also better inform the design choices in the method and evaluation steps, making the work more coherent and convincing overall.

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the 'NOV-COMPETITIVE' novelty verdict and the proposalâ€™s current narrow legal multimodal scope, integrating concepts from broader globally-linked areas such as 'semantic interoperability' and 'effective retrieval' could significantly enhance both impact and novelty. For instance, the proposed Siamese network could be extended to support cross-domain legal information retrieval that facilitates semantic interoperability across different legal systems or document types, aligned with recent advances in 'multimodal deep learning' for recommender systems. Additionally, incorporating more advanced state-of-the-art methods from 'natural language processing' like pretrained legal language models (e.g., LegalBERT) and combining them with image encoders could improve uniqueness and performance. Moreover, exploring applications in adjacent fields like 'authorship analysis' or 'threat detection' to demonstrate broader usability can help generalize the method and increase impact beyond a singular legal niche. This global integration will help elevate the work from a competitive technical combination to a more influential and interdisciplinary contribution.
