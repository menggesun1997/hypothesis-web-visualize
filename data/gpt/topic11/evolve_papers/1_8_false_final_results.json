    "title": "Personalized Privacy-Driven User Modeling for Financial Language Interfaces",
    "Problem_Statement": "One-size-fits-all privacy safeguards in financial LLM interfaces may either overprotect data, reducing utility, or underprotect, risking breaches.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gaps by designing personalized privacy models that learn individual user preferences and regulatory contexts to tailor privacy-preserving strategies dynamically.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a user-adaptive privacy framework where the model learns and updates privacy budgets and protection parameters based on user behavior, risk profiles, and contextual factors, mediated by privacy-preserving federated updates. This balances usability and rigorous privacy guarantees in financial interactions.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect anonymized user interaction logs with privacy labels. 2) Model individual privacy preferences and risk tolerance using reinforcement learning within privacy constraints. 3) Evaluate personalized privacy models versus static policies on utility-privacy trade-offs. 4) Assess compliance impact with respect to financial regulations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User querying investment portfolio data with a high privacy preference setting. Output: The model restricts exposure to aggregate summaries rather than raw details, dynamically adjusting per user-defined privacy parameters.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If personalization compromises global privacy guarantees, revert to group-based privacy tiers or hybrid user-policy approaches."
