    "title": "Self-Supervised Semantic Annotation for Legal Explanation Generation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of annotated legal explanation datasets and costly expert supervision impede scalable legal AI explanation development.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the minimal supervision scarcity gap by adapting self-supervised learning strategies from biomedical and image annotation AI to legal text explanation generation, enabling scalable, low-cost semantic annotation and explanation training without extensive labeled data.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a self-supervised pretraining framework for legal LLMs using proxy tasks like masked legal entity prediction, legal argument structure reconstruction, and cross-document entailment. Use these tasks to induce semantic representations that capture legal concepts and logical dependencies. Then fine-tune for explainability by generating semantic explanations grounded in learned representations, requiring minimal expert labeling for calibration.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect large-scale unlabeled legal corpora including statutes, case law, and contracts. 2. Design and train self-supervised proxy tasks that enforce semantic understanding. 3. Fine-tune models on small expert-labelled datasets for explanation generation. 4. Benchmark explainability quality against fully supervised baselines and assess scalability gains.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Court judgment text. Output: Explanation highlighting legal entities and argument flows reconstructed from self-supervised semantic embeddings, illustrating inferred legal reasoning steps sans extensive annotations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If proxy tasks insufficiently capture semantics, incorporate weak supervision from related domains (biomedical or general NLP). Alternatively, use semi-supervised active learning cycles to incrementally improve annotation quality."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method involves multiple proxy tasks (masked legal entity prediction, legal argument structure reconstruction, and cross-document entailment) to induce semantic representations. However, the proposal lacks a detailed explanation of how these specific tasks will effectively enforce capturing complex legal semantics and logical dependencies, particularly across diverse legal text genres. Clarify the underlying reasoning or prior evidence supporting the suitability and synergy of these tasks in the legal domain, and consider how ambiguities and domain-specific language will be addressed mechanistically within each proxy task to ensure meaningful semantic learning rather than superficial patterns extraction. This will strengthen the soundness of the method's conceptual foundation and better justify the proposed approach to the problem statement's assumptions about semantic understanding needs in legal AI explanation generation. Please provide a more detailed mechanism description and, if possible, preliminary evidence or citations indicating the plausibility of these proxy tasks for legal semantic representation learning. This will increase confidence in the approach's validity and reproducibility at scale, given the legal domain complexities and limited expert annotation resources described in the problem statement and motivation sections.

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan outlines a standard pipeline from data collection to fine-tuning and benchmarking but lacks concrete details on key feasibility aspects. In particular, more precise descriptions are needed on how (1) the large-scale legal corpus will be curated to ensure representativeness and legal domain coverage without violating confidentiality or ethical constraints, (2) the design of proxy tasks will be operationalized and validated before large-scale training, and (3) the small expert-labeled dataset for fine-tuning will be annotated in a cost-effective yet high-quality manner given the resource constraints. Additionally, benchmark design and evaluation metrics for 'explainability quality' require further specification to ensure reproducibility and meaningful comparison against fully supervised baselines. Addressing these points will ensure the experiment plan is practically executable and scientifically rigorous. Consider incorporating pilot studies or iterative validation steps early in the pipeline, and outline resource, ethical, and annotation constraints and mitigations explicitly.
