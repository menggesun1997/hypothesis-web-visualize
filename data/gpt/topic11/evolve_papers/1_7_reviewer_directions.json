    "title": "Dynamic Compliance-Aware Prompt Engineering for Privacy-Preserving Financial LLM Queries",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM prompts in financial contexts may inadvertently trigger privacy leaks or generate non-compliant outputs due to static prompt designs.",
    "Motivation": "Innovates on feedback and regulatory-driven gaps by creating adaptive, compliance-aware prompt engineering strategies integrated with real-time regulatory monitoring and privacy risk assessments.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a dynamic prompt tuning system that modifies input prompts on-the-fly based on detected regulatory requirements, data sensitivity, and user intent. Integrate privacy risk assessment modules to pre-emptively filter or rephrase prompts, maintaining secure and compliant LLM responses.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Define a taxonomy of compliance rules relative to financial queries. 2) Create datasets of prompts annotated with privacy risks and compliance levels. 3) Implement adaptive prompt reformulation models with reinforcement learning to optimize for privacy and regulatory adherence. 4) Compare output compliance and privacy leakages with static prompt baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User prompt \"Show my last 5 credit card transactions.\" System flags data sensitivity and reformulates prompt internally to \"Aggregate recent transactions summary.\" Output: Compliant and privacy-preserving LLM response providing overview without exposing raw data.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive prompt reformulation reduces utility, deploy user-facing warnings combined with interactive feedback loops to guide compliant prompt generation instead."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a dynamic prompt tuning system that adapts prompts on-the-fly using detected regulatory requirements, data sensitivity, and user intent, integrating privacy risk assessment. However, the mechanism lacks clarity on how the system will reliably detect and interpret diverse and evolving financial regulations in real time, and how it will balance privacy risk mitigation with maintaining query utility. Further elaboration on the underlying models or algorithms, the sources and update process for regulatory knowledge, and the interaction between privacy assessment and prompt reformulation is needed to assess the approach's soundness thoroughly and avoid ambiguous or contradictory outputs in practice. Expanding this section with a detailed system architecture, component interactions, and concrete example workflows would improve confidence in the method's robustness and reasoning coherence. This is critical given the complexity and sensitivity of compliance-aware prompt engineering in financial contexts, where errors can have significant legal and privacy implications. Targeting this will strengthen the approach's theoretical foundation and facilitate reproducibility and validation by the research community. This is an urgent area to address before proceeding further in experiments or deployment scenarios, to ensure mechanisms are well-grounded and practically implementable for the problem setting described in the Problem_Statement and Motivation sections. The authors should also clearly specify assumptions around data access, regulation update frequencies, and interpretability of privacy assessments within the system design to reinforce the method's feasibility and soundness overall. The Proposal would greatly benefit from a schematic or pseudocode outlining these mechanisms explicitly, addressing both prompt reformulation logic and privacy-risk detection pipeline details, to reduce second-order risks related to underspecification or oversimplification of compliance nuances in LLM queries for finance applications. This critique targets the Proposed_Method section specifically, advocating for more rigorous and detailed presentation of the method's mechanism and internal logic flow to validate core scientific claims robustly in this highly competitive area of research. Given the complex regulatory environment and data sensitivity in financial LLM deployments, solidifying the mechanism clarifications should be highest priority for ensuring the work's foundational soundness and trustworthiness in real-world conditions. The clarity and rigor of these model and process descriptions will crucially impact peer confidence, reproduce-ability, and ethical safeguards built into the system's dynamic compliance-aware prompt engineering functionality. Therefore, addressing this is a prerequisite step before investing heavily in experimental validation or expanding impact scope toward deployment-ready solutions or industry standards integration. The review strongly recommends the authors focus on this issue as a major refinement to fulfill the research quality expectations for premier conference acceptance and practical relevance in this domain."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the rich list of globally-linked concepts such as federated learning, differential privacy, attribute-based access control, and intelligent decision-making, the proposal could significantly enhance impact and novelty by integrating federated learning techniques to enable privacy-preserving, decentralized prompt adaptation without centralizing sensitive financial data. This would also help address data sovereignty and compliance challenges better. Leveraging differential privacy within the privacy risk assessment modules could provide formal privacy guarantees in prompt reformulation, reinforcing regulatory compliance. Additionally, incorporating attribute-based access control models could fine-tune prompt modifications according to user roles and permissions dynamically, aligning access levels with compliance and privacy policies. Finally, embedding intelligent decision-making frameworks could optimize prompt adaptation strategies over time by learning from compliance outcomes and user feedback, making the system more robust and generalizable. These integrations would jointly position the research at the frontier of privacy-preserving, compliance-aware NLP systems with strong theoretical rigor and practical feasibility, addressing key community interests and advancing state of the art beyond existing static or heuristic prompt engineering approaches. This suggestion targets the intersection of Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan to systematically incorporate these advanced concepts, increase novelty beyond competitive thresholds, and create a compelling research trajectory for impactful contributions in secure financial AI applications."
