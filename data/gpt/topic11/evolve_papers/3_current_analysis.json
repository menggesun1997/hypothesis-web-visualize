Many virtual environments have been developed with immersive experience and digital transformation, but most are incoherent instead of being integrated into a platform. In this context, metaverse has been introduced as a shared virtual world that is fueled by many emerging technologies. Among such technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown the great importance of enhancing immersive experience and enabling human-like intelligence of virtual agents. In this survey, we make a beneficial effort to explore the role of AI, including machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures, in the foundation and development of the metaverse. As the main contributions, we convey a comprehensive investigation of AI-based methods concerning several technical aspects (e.g., natural language processing, machine vision, blockchain, networking, digital twin, and neural interface) that have potentials to build virtual worlds in the metaverse. Furthermore, several primary AI-aided applications, including healthcare, manufacturing, smart cities, and gaming, are studied to be promisingly deployed in the virtual worlds. Finally, we conclude the key contribution and open some future research directions of AI for the metaverse. Serving as a foundational survey, this work will help researchers, including experts and non-experts in related fields, in applying, developing, and optimizing AI techniques to polish the appearance of virtual worlds and improve the quality of applications built in the metaverse.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'A Metaverse: Taxonomy, Components, Applications, and Open Challenges', 'abstract': 'Unlike previous studies on the Metaverse based on Second Life, the current Metaverse is based on the social value of Generation Z that online and offline selves are not different. With the technological development of deep learning-based high-precision recognition models and natural generation models, Metaverse is being strengthened with various factors, from mobile-based always-on access to connectivity with reality using virtual currency. The integration of enhanced social activities and neural-net methods requires a new definition of Metaverse suitable for the present, different from the previous Metaverse. This paper divides the concepts and essential techniques necessary for realizing the Metaverse into three components (i.e., hardware, software, and contents) and three approaches (i.e., user interaction, implementation, and application) rather than marketing or hardware approach to conduct a comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, we describe essential methods based on three components and techniques to Metaverse’s representative Ready Player One, Roblox, and Facebook research in the domain of films, games, and studies. Finally, we summarize the limitations and directions for implementing the immersive Metaverse as social influences, constraints, and open challenges.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'KeepAugment: A Simple Information-Preserving Data Augmentation Approach', 'abstract': 'Data augmentation (DA) is an essential technique for training state-of-the-art deep learning systems. In this paper, we empirically show that the standard data augmentation methods may introduce distribution shift and consequently hurt the performance on unaugmented data during inference. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach, dubbed KeepAugment, to increase the fidelity of augmented images. The idea is to use the saliency map to detect important regions on the original images and preserve these informative regions during augmentation. This information-preserving strategy allows us to generate more faithful training examples. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves upon a number of prior art data augmentation schemes, e.g. AutoAugment, Cutout, random erasing, achieving promising results on image classification, semi-supervised image classification, multi-view multi-camera tracking and object detection.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition', 'abstract': 'Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers-8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

Advances like SPPnet [1] and Fast R-CNN [2] have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features-using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model [3] , our detection system has a frame rate of 5 fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks.

The current systems are crippled by the unavailability of ground truth text annotations for these datasets as well as lack of scene text detection and recognition datasets on real images disallowing the progress in the field of OCR and evaluation of scene text based reasoning in isolation from OCR systems. In this work, we propose TextOCR, an arbitrary-shaped scene text detection and recognition with 900k annotated words collected on real images from TextVQA dataset. We show that current state-of-the-art text-recognition (OCR) models fail to perform well on TextOCR and that training on TextOCR helps achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple other OCR datasets as well. We use a TextOCR trained OCR model to create PixelM4C model which can do scene text based reasoning on an image in an end-to-end fashion, allowing us to revisit several design choices to achieve new state-of-the-art performance on TextVQA dataset.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'What Is Wrong With Scene Text Recognition Model Comparisons? Dataset and Model Analysis', 'abstract': 'Many new proposals for scene text recognition (STR) models have been introduced in recent years. While each claim to have pushed the boundary of the technology, a holistic and fair comparison has been largely missing in the field due to the inconsistent choices of training and evaluation datasets. This paper addresses this difficulty with three major contributions. First, we examine the inconsistencies of training and evaluation datasets, and the performance gap results from inconsistencies. Second, we introduce a unified four-stage STR framework that most existing STR models fit into. Using this framework allows for the extensive evaluation of previously proposed STR modules and the discovery of previously unexplored module combinations. Third, we analyze the module-wise contributions to performance in terms of accuracy, speed, and memory demand, under one consistent set of training and evaluation datasets. Such analyses clean up the hindrance on the current comparisons to understand the performance gain of the existing modules.

This work was done when Yuliang Liu was visiting The University of Adelaide.', 'abstract': 'Scene text detection and recognition has received increasing research attention. Existing methods can be roughly categorized into two groups: character-based and segmentation-based. These methods either are costly for character annotation or need to maintain a complex pipeline, which is often not suitable for real-time applications. Here we address the problem by proposing the Adaptive Bezier-Curve Network (ABCNet). Our contributions are three-fold: 1) For the first time, we adaptively fit oriented or curved text by a parameterized Bezier curve. 2) We design a novel BezierAlign layer for extracting accurate convolution features of a text instance with arbitrary shapes, significantly improving the precision compared with previous methods. 3) Compared with standard bounding box detection, our Bezier curve detection introduces negligible computation overhead, resulting in superiority of our method in both efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on oriented or curved benchmark datasets, namely Total-Text and CTW1500, demonstrate that ABCNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, meanwhile significantly improving the speed. In particular, on Total-Text, our realtime version is over 10 times faster than recent state-of-the-art methods with a competitive recognition accuracy.

The DMO mimics the foraging behavior of the dwarf mongoose. The restrictive mode of prey capture (feeding) has dramatically affected the mongooses’ social behavior and ecological adaptations to compensate for efficient family nutrition. The compensatory behavioral adaptations of the mongoose are prey size, space utilization, group size, and food provisioning. Three social groups of the dwarf mongoose are used in the proposed algorithm, the alpha group, babysitters, and the scout group. The family forage as a unit, and the alpha female initiates foraging, determines the foraging path, the distance covered, and the sleeping mounds. A certain number of the mongoose population (usually a mixture of males and females) serve as the babysitters. They remain with the young until the group returns at midday or evening. The babysitters are exchanged for the first to forage with the group (exploitation phase). The dwarf mongooses do not build a nest for their young; they move them from one sleeping mound to another and do not return to the previously foraged site. The dwarf mongoose has adopted a seminomadic way of life in a territory large enough to support the entire group (exploration phase). The nomadic behavior prevents overexploitation of a particular area. It also ensures exploration of the whole territory because no previously visited sleeping mound is returned. The performance of the proposed DMO algorithm is compared with seven other algorithms to show its effectiveness in terms of different performance metrics and statistics. In most cases, the near-optimal solutions achieved by the DMO are better than the best solutions obtained by the current state-of-the-art algorithms.
