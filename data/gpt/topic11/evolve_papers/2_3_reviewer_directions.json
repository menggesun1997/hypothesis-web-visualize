    "title": "Legal Ontology-Driven Contrastive Explanation Generation for LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Legal AI lacks explainability methods that produce contrastive explanations grounded in legal hierarchical ontologies to clarify why certain conclusions were reached over alternatives.",
    "Motivation": "Bridges the domain-adapted explainability gap by constructing contrastive explanations mapped to legal ontology structures, enhancing user trust through clear articulation of alternative legal interpretations and their hierarchical relationships.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an explanation generator that produces contrastive explanations by contrasting predicted legal outcomes against plausible alternatives drawn from the legal ontology. The model leverages a dual-encoder architecture embedding legal concepts and case contexts, generating explanation segments that explicitly contrast and justify selected conclusions over alternatives in an interpretable, ontology-aware manner.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Construct a dataset of legal cases with annotated alternative outcomes and hierarchical legal concept tags. 2. Train dual-encoders to represent cases and legal concepts. 3. Develop a contrastive explanation generation module leveraging ontology-driven knowledge. 4. Evaluate explanation informativeness, user interpretability, and alignment with legal expert judgments.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patent infringement judgment. Output: Explanation contrasting ruling with alternative interpretations (e.g., non-infringement) clearly mapped to ontology concepts representing patent claim elements, highlighting reasoning for preferred conclusion.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If dual-encoder similarity fails to distinguish alternatives, integrate graph neural networks over legal ontologies for richer relational representation or augment with rule-based legal reasoning modules."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks specific details on how the dataset of legal cases with annotated alternative outcomes and hierarchical legal concept tags will be constructed. Since legal domain annotation is complex and costly, the plan should clarify data sources, annotation protocols, and how legal ontology integration will be validated to ensure feasibility and reproducibility. Moreover, it would benefit from a clearer definition of evaluation metrics for explanation informativeness and alignment with legal expert judgments, specifying qualitative and quantitative criteria, and how user interpretability will be measured empirically with target users (e.g., lawyers or domain experts). Without these details, it's unclear if the experimental plan is practical within common project constraints and can yield robust conclusions about the method's effectiveness or generalizability in real-world legal AI contexts. Strengthening this section will directly improve the project's feasibility and credibility in delivering sound, impactful outcomes on explainability in legal AI applications, a notoriously challenging area due to domain-specific complexity and interpretability requirements.\n\nSuggested action: Provide detailed annotation plans, dataset sourcing, concrete evaluation protocols (including human evaluation), and milestones that de-risk the experimental effort and demonstrate readiness to handle domain challenges effectively within the outlined plan, increasing confidence in feasibility."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating and focus on legal ontology-driven contrastive explanations, integrating concepts from 'knowledge graph', 'knowledge engineering', and 'rule-based system' could significantly strengthen both novelty and impact. Specifically, augmenting the dual-encoder architecture with explicit graph neural networks operating over comprehensive legal knowledge graphs representing multi-relational ontologies can enable richer contextualization of legal concepts, case facts, and alternative legal interpretations. Additionally, embedding symbolic reasoning modules or rule-based legal inference engines can complement learned representations, ensuring legally valid contrasts and explanations grounded in established legal rules. This hybrid neuro-symbolic approach would help overcome limitations of purely embedding-based contrastive approaches and boost model explainability, robustness, and user trust. Emphasizing semantic interoperability with broader legal knowledge sources and aligning explanations with symbolic reasoning chains could differentiate the work in a competitive space and accelerate adoption in legal AI and NLP research communities. Considering these globally-linked concepts for a more integrated and hybrid approach will heighten scientific contributions and practical benefits, elevating the work's standing."
