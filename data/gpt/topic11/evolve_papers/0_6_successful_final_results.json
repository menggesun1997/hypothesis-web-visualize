        "title": "Adversarial Psychological Profile Guided Data Augmentation for Bias Resilience in Clinical LLMs with Preliminary Validation and Rigorous Experimental Framework",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in healthcare often encounter bias and hallucinations when processing clinical data influenced by varied psychological profiles, yet training datasets insufficiently capture linguistic diversity reflecting such profiles—especially extreme psychological traits like those in the dark triad. Critically, the assumption that these psychological traits reliably manifest as identifiable linguistic markers in clinical notes remains underexplored, risking ineffective adversarial augmentation if the representations are unrealistic or artefactual. This research addresses the gap by first validating mappings between psychological traits and clinical language variations, then leveraging validated adversarial augmentation to enhance bias resilience in clinical LLMs.",
        "Motivation": "Current approaches to mitigating bias and hallucination in clinical LLMs overlook the nuanced influence of psychological profile-driven language variability. By pioneering an interdisciplinary integration of computational psychology, generative adversarial modeling, and contrastive learning, this work innovates beyond existing bias mitigation techniques. It uniquely employs preliminary empirical validation of psychological-linguistic signatures in clinical contexts to justify controlled adversarial augmentation, significantly advancing robustness against rare but consequential personality-driven inputs. Additionally, the inclusion of cognitive computing principles and generative adversarial networks (GANs) as adversarial sample generators sets a new competitive standard in AI model resilience.",
        "Proposed_Method": "1. Conduct preliminary empirical studies and literature synthesis to identify and statistically validate linguistic markers associated with dark triad traits in clinical text corpora, using psycholinguistic analysis and supervised classifiers.\n2. Develop a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based adversarial data augmentation module: the generator produces synthetic clinical notes embedding validated psychological trait linguistic patterns, while the discriminator ensures clinical plausibility and diversity.\n3. Integrate cognitive computing frameworks to simulate clinical reasoning variability under psychological trait influences, guiding adversarial sample realism.\n4. Fine-tune clinical LLMs using a composite loss combining task-specific objectives with carefully designed contrastive loss terms that explicitly enforce invariance to psychological linguistic perturbations.\n5. Operationalize contrastive objectives by pairing standard and adversarially augmented samples, minimizing representation distances for equivalent clinical inferences.\n6. Scale the augmentation on a sufficiently large and representative clinical dataset, ensuring balanced representation of psychological profiles.\n7. Evaluate against well-defined, quantitative metrics for bias resilience (e.g., response consistency score across psychological variants), clinical accuracy (F1, precision/recall on diagnostic tasks), and hallucination reduction (factually grounded output rate), against strong baselines including non-augmented and naive data augmentation models.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Literature review and psycholinguistic analysis to compile candidate linguistic features linked to dark triad traits in clinical notes.\n2. Annotate or leverage existing datasets with psychological trait information or proxies; develop and validate supervised classifiers to detect these linguistic markers.\n3. Design and train a GAN architecture conditioned on psychological trait embeddings to generate adversarial clinical texts.\n4. Implement a cognitive computing inspired reasoning simulator to assess generated sample plausibility.\n5. Define contrastive loss functions: (a) sample pairs with/without psychological linguistic perturbations, (b) control for semantic equivalence.\n6. Fine-tune selected LLM (e.g., clinical domain-adapted GPT variant) on augmented datasets incorporating these samples.\n7. Rigorous evaluation using: (a) bias resilience score—measured by variance in model outputs across psychological linguistic variants; (b) clinical accuracy on held-out diagnostic benchmarks; (c) hallucination reduction metrics using established factuality checkers.\n8. Perform ablation studies varying augmentation intensity and loss weighting.\n9. Document reproducible protocols, and open-source adversarial augmentation module and evaluation scripts.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: Clinical note describing patient symptoms with language manipulated to simulate extreme Machiavellian traits validated by prior psycholinguistic analysis.\nExpected Output: The fine-tuned LLM produces stable, clinically accurate diagnostic interpretation consistent with non-psychologically perturbed cases, indicating representation invariance.\n\nAdditional Tests:\n- Clinical notes perturbed to reflect narcissistic linguistic features versus baseline notes; LLM output consistency measured.\n- Hallucination challenge sets with psychological trait-laden inputs; reduction in fabricated or irrelevant information is quantitatively assessed.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If adversarial augmentation inclusion leads to overall performance degradation or overfitting, implement curriculum learning strategies that gradually introduce adversarial samples with progressive weighting. Additionally, dynamically tune GAN generator-discriminator balance and apply reinforcement learning feedback loops to improve synthetic sample realism. If early psycholinguistic validation reveals weak or inconsistent markers, shift focus to more robust and interpretable psychological trait proxies or explore transfer learning from psychological corpora. Alternatively, incorporate recommender system techniques to select highest-quality adversarial samples for training."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that adversarially generated clinical texts reflecting extreme psychological profiles (specifically dark triad traits) can effectively improve LLM bias resilience requires stronger justification. The mapping between psychological traits and linguistic features in clinical notes is complex and not well-established, especially for rare or extreme profiles. The proposal would benefit from preliminary validation or literature support showing that these linguistic signatures are reliably identifiable and impactful on LLM outputs before investing into adversarial augmentation. Otherwise, this assumption risks undermining the method's soundness if the adversarial samples do not realistically represent valid or meaningful clinical language variations linked to psychological traits, possibly producing artefactual or misleading training signals in the LLM fine-tuning process. Thus, more explicit discussion or initial experiments on linguistic markers tied to dark triad traits in clinical contexts are strongly advised to strengthen conceptual soundness and feasibility of the adversarial augmentation approach in the Proposed_Method section and Problem_Statement context."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while logically ordered, lacks concrete details on how the adversarial data generation and contrastive learning objectives will be operationalized and validated, which puts feasibility at risk. For instance, the plan should specify the techniques or models intended for generating controlled perturbations reflecting psychological profiles, how contrastive losses will be designed to enforce bias invariance, and the size and representativeness of datasets. Moreover, the evaluation metrics need clearer definitions and baselines for bias resilience, clinical accuracy, and hallucination reduction—simply citing these metrics does not guarantee scientific rigor. Without clear operational definitions, experimental protocols, and robust evaluation frameworks, the pipeline risks being infeasible or inconclusive. Adding these details, along with preliminary experiments or references to analogous workflows, would significantly improve the section’s practicality and reproducibility."
