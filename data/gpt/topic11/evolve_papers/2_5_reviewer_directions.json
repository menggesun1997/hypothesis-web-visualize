    "title": "Multilingual Hierarchical Explainability Framework for Cross-Jurisdictional Legal LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current explainability frameworks lack adaptation for multilingual legal corpora and diverse jurisdictional ontologies, limiting deployment across global legal systems.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses critical gaps in domain-specific customization by developing hierarchical explainability frameworks integrating multiple jurisdictional legal ontologies and adapted minimal supervision strategies, enabling semantically consistent explanations across languages and regions.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a multilingual legal LLM that integrates hierarchical ontologies from various jurisdictions, embedding cross-lingual mappings and legal taxonomy alignments. The explanation framework generates hierarchy-grounded multilingual explanations, using transfer learning and minimal expert supervision per jurisdiction to ensure accuracy and cultural/legal contextual relevance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multilingual legal corpora and jurisdiction-specific ontologies. 2. Align ontologies cross-lingually via embedding projection techniques. 3. Train multilingual LLMs with ontology embeddings. 4. Evaluate explanation consistency, semantic fidelity, and cross-jurisdictional applicability with multilingual legal experts.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Labor law clause in Spanish context. Output: Explanation grounded in Spanish labor ontology hierarchy and cross-referenced with EU labor law ontology showing aligned legal concepts in both languages.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multilingual ontology alignment is problematic, limit initial scope to bilingual frameworks with manual curation or utilize unsupervised alignment methods from general multilingual NLP."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a logical sequence but lacks concrete strategies and contingency details for several critical challenges. For example, the plan to 'Align ontologies cross-lingually via embedding projection techniques' needs specifying which embedding methods will be used and how alignment quality will be quantitatively assessed. Additionally, the evaluation with multilingual legal experts is mentioned but missing key components such as inter-annotator agreement protocols, metrics for semantic fidelity, and how cultural or jurisdictional nuances will be systematically captured. To improve feasibility, the plan should also address potential data scarcity in less-resourced jurisdictions and detail how minimal expert supervision will be operationalized practically in those contexts. Incorporating these elaborations and risk mitigation strategies will substantially strengthen the scientific soundness and practicability of the experimental setup for this complex multilingual and cross-jurisdictional challenge.\n\nSuggested action: Include specific embedding projection methods (e.g., VecMap, MUSE), define quantitative alignment and explanation quality metrics, elaborate expert evaluation protocols, and detail fallback mechanisms for jurisdictions with limited data or expertise availability within the experiment plan section to solidify feasibility and reproducibility of the work.\n\nTarget section: Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "Given the idea sits in a highly competitive space combining multilingual LLMs, legal ontologies, and explainability, integrating aspects from broader, globally linked concepts can substantially amplify impact and novelty. For instance, incorporating 'human-centered artificial intelligence' principles can enhance explanation frameworks by tailoring them to diverse user groups (e.g., lawyers, judges, citizens) across jurisdictions, ensuring explanations are not only semantically consistent but also cognitively meaningful in varying cultural contexts. Similarly, leveraging 'conversational AI' techniques to develop interactive explanation agents would increase accessibility and practical utility of the system in real-world legal workflows. Moreover, aligning the framework with 'requirements engineering' and 'business process management' methodologies could facilitate mapping legal explanations directly to enterprise risk and compliance processes, broadening relevance and adoption potential. Such integrations would move the proposal beyond a domain-specific technical contribution toward a holistic, socially attuned, and business-relevant intelligent system.\n\nSuggested action: Expand the research scope to incorporate human-centered AI design principles and conversational interfaces, linking with requirements engineering and business process management domains to enhance interdisciplinary novelty and practical impact.\n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"
