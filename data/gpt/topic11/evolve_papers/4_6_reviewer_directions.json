    "title": "Multi-Stakeholder Fairness Evaluation Framework for LLM-Driven Social Media Moderation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluation metrics overlook multiple stakeholder perspectives, risking narrow fairness assessments in LLM moderation systems.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical gap around accountability and fairness by proposing an evaluation framework that integrates views from users, moderators, regulators, and marginalized groups for holistic moderation assessment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a composite evaluation suite combining quantitative fairness metrics (e.g., equal opportunity, disparate impact) with qualitative surveys and participatory feedback collected via interactive platforms. The framework weights stakeholder priorities and generates actionable fairness diagnostics co-developed with diverse communities.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect moderation datasets and multiple stakeholder feedback.\n2) Define and operationalize multi-perspective fairness metrics.\n3) Apply framework to existing moderation models.\n4) Compare insights from single vs. multi-stakeholder evaluations.\n5) Refine models incorporating diagnostic findings for improved fairness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Moderation case involving flagged content from minority community.\nOutput: Fairness dashboard shows discrepancies and stakeholder sentiment reports guiding model adjustments.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-stakeholder feedback is sparse, simulate stakeholder preferences or prioritize marginalized group metrics initially for iterative refinement."

Please elaborate on concrete methods and partnerships to reliably collect diverse stakeholder input, address potential biases or sparsity in participation, and validate the qualitative and quantitative fairness metrics to ensure robustness and reproducibility of the framework's application in real moderation systems. Clarifying these aspects will strengthen the scientific rigor and practicability of your approach for adoption and evaluation at scale in social media platforms' moderation environments (Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)."

          "feedback_content": "To enhance impact and novelty given the recognized competitive landscape, consider integrating relevant concepts from global AI governance and legal frameworks such as the Artificial Intelligence Act, Digital Services Act, and human rights law. For instance, explicitly aligning or validating the fairness evaluation framework against emerging regulatory standards or legal duties for AI systems could increase the framework's applicability and policy relevance. Additionally, incorporating civic engagement platforms to co-develop stakeholder input processes might improve participatory design and acceptance of the framework. This integration would elevate the work beyond technical fairness assessments to a multidimensional accountability tool aligned with evolving socio-legal AI imperatives (Proposed_Method)."
