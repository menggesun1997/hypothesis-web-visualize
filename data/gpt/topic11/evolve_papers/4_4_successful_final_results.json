        "title": "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) Framework for Collective Ethical Moderation Oversight with Modular LLM Integration and Quantitative Evaluation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Centralized social media moderation systems often lack participatory, decentralized mechanisms for ethical oversight, which undermines accountability, fairness, and transparency in AI-driven content control.",
        "Motivation": "While decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have been explored for governance, existing moderation approaches seldom clarify the dynamic technical integration between DAO decisions and language model (LLM) behavior. This proposal innovates by specifying a modular, real-time interface linking DAO-governed ethical policies with LLM moderation layers via Zero Trust Architecture principles, enhancing robustness, auditability, and adaptability beyond current state-of-the-art decentralized moderation frameworks. The approach leverages blockchain immutability for transparent governance and integrates graph convolutional neural networks to model social impact propagation of moderation decisions, thereby elevating collective ethical oversight in content moderation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-layered architecture where a DAO deployed on blockchain governs ethical moderation policies through community voting. The DAO smart contracts produce verifiable policy outputs codified as modular, parameterized rule-sets. These outputs feed into a Policy Enforcement Engine (PEE), which serves as an API gateway employing Zero Trust Architecture to enforce strict authentication and authorization for policy changes. The PEE translates DAO policies into fine-grained control signals that dynamically modulate LLM moderation submodules, particularly affecting content filtering thresholds, sensitive topic classifiers, and response generation constraints. LLM moderation components internally incorporate graph convolutional neural networks to analyze and predict content impact cascades under new policy parameters, ensuring adaptation aligns with community ethics. Real-time policy updates are propagated using off-chain Light Client protocols minimizing blockchain latency. Conflict resolution is orchestrated via a layered arbitration module: first attempting automated reconciliation based on policy priority hierarchies, then escalating to expert-defined overrides integrated within the DAO as privileged voting tiers. All interactions and state changes are immutably logged, enabling comprehensive audit trails and dispute mediation. The system is designed modularly to facilitate extensibility and robustness against performance bottlenecks or governance deadlocks.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop and deploy DAO governance smart contracts and front-end interfaces emphasizing authenticated user participation and expert roles.\n2) Implement the Policy Enforcement Engine with Zero Trust Architecture protocols and integrate it with LLM moderation modules embedding graph convolutional neural networks.\n3) Set up a realistic testbed social platform hosting 500-1000 diverse users recruited to represent varied demographics for community governance.\n4) Define and continuously measure quantitative metrics including: (a) community engagement rate (proposals submitted, votes cast), (b) decision transparency score (blockchain traceability and user audit calls), (c) moderation fairness indices (false positive/negative rates under evolving policies), (d) system latency from vote to policy effect, and (e) user trust and satisfaction via structured surveys.\n5) Evaluate performance and agility under baseline DAO-only governance, versus fallback hierarchical voting and expert override mechanisms under simulated congestion or governance disputes.\n6) Analyze propagation effects of policy shifts using GCN analytics on content spread and moderation impact.\n7) Document failure modes, conduct robustness tests, and refine interface latency for real-time adaptation.\n8) Publish anonymized logs and code for reproducibility and community validation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user submits controversial content involving emerging sensitive topics lacking prior moderation rules.\nOutput: Community members propose new ethical guidelines via DAO voting; the Policy Enforcement Engine converts winning proposals into updated moderation parameters lowering content visibility thresholds for flagged topics.\nExplanation: Graph convolutional neural networks predict potential spread amplification under new rules; LLM adjusts moderation dynamically with minimal latency. All votes, policy changes, and content decisions are recorded immutably, allowing transparent audit trails and rapid dispute resolution via expert overrides if needed.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should DAO governance voting cycles induce excessive latency delaying moderation responsiveness, introduce hierarchical weighted voting augmenting rapid-expert overrides embedded in the DAO contract, enabling expedited decisions without sacrificing democratic legitimacy. Additionally, implement off-chain trusted oracles to expedite policy proposal validation and leverage caching mechanisms in the Policy Enforcement Engine to minimize redundant computations, ensuring system agility and continuity."

However, the mechanism explaining precisely how LLM moderation models will adapt in response to DAO decisions is insufficiently detailed. Clarify the technical interfaces between the DAO's policy outputs and the LLM's moderation layers, specifying how policy changes translate into modulated behavior, how real-time adaptation occurs with minimal latency, and how conflicts between ethical constraints and model behavior are resolved. Without these details, the soundness of the approach is unclear and the innovation cannot be effectively assessed or reproduced, limiting credibility and impact potential. Consider including modular architectural diagrams or prototypes clarifying this interaction depth and addressing potential failure modes to strengthen the methodâ€™s rigor and clarity within the paper's Proposed_Method section."

Enhancing the experimental design with these specifics will improve feasibility confirmation and strengthen the contribution's validation rigor."
