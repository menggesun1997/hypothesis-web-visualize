    "title": "Multi-Modal Green AI Training via Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer",
    "Problem_Statement": "Environmental assessment and efficiency techniques in LLM training often neglect insights and methods from other domains like computer vision or health informatics, missing cross-modal optimization opportunities.",
    "Motivation": "Taps into external gaps by proposing a cross-domain framework that transfers green AI best practices from vision and health (such as energy-efficient model pruning and anomaly detection) to LLM training, enhancing sustainability via interdisciplinary knowledge synthesis.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a transfer learning pipeline that adapts model compression and energy monitoring techniques successfully used in vision and health models to NLP transformers. This includes fine-tuning pruning policies informed by domain-agnostic green AI heuristics and integrating cross-modal anomaly detectors for energy spikes.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Review energy-efficient strategies from vision and health AI. 2) Implement adapted pruning and optimization in transformers. 3) Integrate multi-modal anomaly detection modules. 4) Evaluate on large NLP datasets with energy consumption tracking. 5) Quantify environmental improvements and model trade-offs.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Standard LLM training task with baseline and cross-domain adapted pruning. Output: Achieved similar E2E accuracy with 30% less energy, validated anomaly detection during training irregularities.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct transfer is ineffective, conduct domain-specific tuning of pruning thresholds or train new anomaly detectors specifically for NLP training telemetry."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section outlines a promising cross-domain transfer pipeline but lacks clarity on how exactly domain-agnostic green AI heuristics will be adapted and validated within the vastly different architectures and training dynamics of NLP transformers. More detailed mechanisms on how pruning policies and anomaly detectors will be parameterized and tuned specifically for NLP workloads need to be provided to establish the scientific soundness of the approach and to reduce risks of ineffective cross-modal transfer due to domain mismatch—especially given differences in model size, data modalities, and training objectives across vision, health, and language domains. Explicit examples or preliminary results on adaptation strategies would strengthen confidence in soundness and feasibility of the proposed mechanism. This will also help clarify assumptions currently implicit in the method description, mitigating potential breakdowns in transferability assumptions ([SOU-ASSUMPTION]). Also, defining metrics beyond energy consumption reductions, such as potential impacts on language model accuracy or latency, should be detailed to frame trade-offs clearly and concretely in the method description and experiment plan section.  \n\nActionable suggestion: augment the Proposed_Method with detailed algorithmic steps or pseudo-code illustrating the adaptive pruning and anomaly detection integration workflows tailored for NLP transformers, along with a plan to quantitatively validate transferability of heuristics from vision and health domains to NLP training contexts within the initial experiments stage (step 1 or 2). This will substantiate the method’s mechanism and assumptions with clarity and rigor, facilitating better experimental design and reproducibility."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screening novelty result (NOV-COMPETITIVE), to significantly enhance the idea’s impact and novelty, you should integrate insights from the globally-linked concepts, particularly focusing on \"vision-language models\" and \"contrastive language-image pre-training.\" These models exemplify successful multi-modal fusion and cross-domain learning.  By incorporating contrastive learning techniques or architectural ideas from vision-language models into your cross-domain green AI transfer pipeline, the research could establish stronger, principled bridges between vision and language modalities specifically optimized for energy efficiency. For example, leveraging state-of-the-art contrastive methods as part of the pruning or anomaly detection schemes could create richer shared representations that facilitate more effective pruning policy adaptation or energy anomaly prediction across modalities. \n\nActionable suggestion: extend the Proposed_Method by experimenting with knowledge transfer not only at heuristic or policy levels but also via shared latent spaces or contrastive objectives inspired by vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), thereby improving both representational alignment across modalities and sustainability impact. This would move the work beyond conventional domain adaptation towards innovative multi-modal joint optimization, potentially differentiating it strongly in a competitive field and broadening its impact across green computing and deep learning communities."
