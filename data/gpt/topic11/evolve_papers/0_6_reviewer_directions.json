    "title": "Adversarial Psychological Profile Guided Data Augmentation for Bias Resilience",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM training data in healthcare lack diversity reflecting varied psychological profiles, leading to resilience gaps against bias and hallucinations when encountering rare or extreme personality-driven inputs.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal bias robustness gap by pioneering data augmentation guided by adversarial generation of inputs embedding psychological trait extremes, ensuring LLM exposure to and mitigation of such biases during training.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement an adversarial data generation module producing synthetic clinical texts manipulated to reflect extreme psychological profiles identified in dark triad inventories. These samples augment the training corpus, compelling the LLM to learn invariant, bias-resistant representations through contrastive learning objectives. This strategy crosses NLP, psychology, and adversarial training domains for novel bias mitigation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Define and model psychological trait linguistic signatures. 2. Generate adversarial clinical cases via controlled perturbations. 3. Augment training sets and fine-tune LLMs with contrastive loss. 4. Evaluate robustness on held-out clinical reasoning and hallucination benchmarks across psychological trait variations. Metrics: bias resilience score, clinical accuracy, hallucination reduction.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Adversarial clinical note with extreme Machiavellian linguistic features. Output: Stable clinical interpretation unaffected by manipulative language cues.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adversarial samples degrade overall accuracy, reduce augmentation intensity or integrate curriculum learning to balance standard and adversarial data."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that adversarially generated clinical texts reflecting extreme psychological profiles (specifically dark triad traits) can effectively improve LLM bias resilience requires stronger justification. The mapping between psychological traits and linguistic features in clinical notes is complex and not well-established, especially for rare or extreme profiles. The proposal would benefit from preliminary validation or literature support showing that these linguistic signatures are reliably identifiable and impactful on LLM outputs before investing into adversarial augmentation. Otherwise, this assumption risks undermining the method's soundness if the adversarial samples do not realistically represent valid or meaningful clinical language variations linked to psychological traits, possibly producing artefactual or misleading training signals in the LLM fine-tuning process. Thus, more explicit discussion or initial experiments on linguistic markers tied to dark triad traits in clinical contexts are strongly advised to strengthen conceptual soundness and feasibility of the adversarial augmentation approach in the Proposed_Method section and Problem_Statement context."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while logically ordered, lacks concrete details on how the adversarial data generation and contrastive learning objectives will be operationalized and validated, which puts feasibility at risk. For instance, the plan should specify the techniques or models intended for generating controlled perturbations reflecting psychological profiles, how contrastive losses will be designed to enforce bias invariance, and the size and representativeness of datasets. Moreover, the evaluation metrics need clearer definitions and baselines for bias resilience, clinical accuracy, and hallucination reduction—simply citing these metrics does not guarantee scientific rigor. Without clear operational definitions, experimental protocols, and robust evaluation frameworks, the pipeline risks being infeasible or inconclusive. Adding these details, along with preliminary experiments or references to analogous workflows, would significantly improve the section’s practicality and reproducibility."
