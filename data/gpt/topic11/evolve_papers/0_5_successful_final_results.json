    "title": "Cross-Domain Human-Centered Computing Integration for Enhanced Validity Indicators",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM validity indicators in healthcare rely heavily on standard NLP performance metrics, neglecting deeper human-centered computing insights from psychological and biomedical sciences that could elevate fairness, transparency, and clinical trustworthiness.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the external gap by bridging human-centered computing knowledge with healthcare LLM validation, enabling innovatively multidimensional, ethically grounded validity indicators beyond current limited metrics.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Forge an interdisciplinary framework combining expertise from human factors engineering, clinical psychology, and biomedical ethics to design composite validity indicators. This includes real-time user trust assessment modules, transparent explanation metrics grounded in psychological theory, and biomedical risk indexes assessing potential clinical harm. The framework is implemented as an interactive evaluator tool supplementing LLM deployment in medical settings.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Review and synthesize HCI, psychology, and bioethics measures relevant to AI system validation. 2. Develop composite validity scoring rubric. 3. Integrate with LLM output explanation engines. 4. Conduct user studies with clinicians evaluating trust and decision quality supported by the toolkit. 5. Benchmark against traditional NLP validity metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Scenario: Clinician queries LLM for diagnostic suggestions; the evaluator reports real-time bias risk scores, trust indicators, and ethical compliance alerts.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If interdisciplinary validity indicators prove unwieldy, prioritize a subset based on user feedback and progressively refine scoring heuristics with iterative clinician involvement."

        "title": "Integrative Multivariate Human-Centered Validity Framework for Trustworthy Healthcare LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language model (LLM) validity assessments in healthcare overly depend on traditional NLP performance metrics, lacking incorporation of nuanced human-centered computing insights. This gap overlooks complex clinician psychological states, personality influences, and biomedical risk factors that critically affect fairness, transparency, trust, and ultimately safe clinical decision-making.",
        "Motivation": "To move beyond a competitive baseline in LLM validation, this research proposes a novel interdisciplinary framework that integrates psychometric personality profiling (e.g., Big Five Personality test), real-time affective state analysis (e.g., distress detection via NLP from clinician interactions), and biomedical risk indexes into composite validity indicators. This multivariate, ethically-grounded approach offers richer, context-aware validity signals, capturing how clinician characteristics and states modulate trust and clinical outcomes. It bridges human-centered computing, psychology, and bioethics in a unique way that advances healthcare AI validation toward more transparent, fair, and clinically trustworthy deployments.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We will develop an advanced human-centered validity evaluation platform for healthcare LLMs by: (1) incorporating clinician personality profiling using the validated Big Five Personality Test to model individual trust propensities; (2) deploying NLP-based distress and affective state recognition modules inspired by the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus, capturing real-time clinician emotional states during LLM interaction; (3) designing biomedical risk indexes evaluating potential clinical harm from LLM outputs, guided by biomedical ethics frameworks; (4) employing multivariate analysis of variance and machine learning classification algorithms to model interactions between personality traits, affective states, LLM outputs, and validity outcomes; (5) integrating these heterogeneous indicators into a composite scoring rubric linked to transparent explanation metrics; and (6) embedding this framework into an interactive evaluator tool coupled with LLM explanation engines, enabling dynamic clinician trust assessment and ethical compliance alerts during clinical use.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Systematic literature review of human-centered computing measures (psychological trust theories, personality profiling, biomedical ethics metrics) and NLP affect recognition models. 2. Operationalize personality assessment using the Big Five Personality Inventory with clinicians in pilot studies. 3. Develop and validate NLP models for real-time distress and affective state classification from clinician-LMM dialogues, using Distress Analysis Interview Corpus adaptations. 4. Define biomedical risk indexes via expert panels to quantify potential LLM-generated clinical harms. 5. Construct composite validity scoring rubric combining psychometric, affective, and biomedical indices via multivariate analysis of variance and ML classifiers. 6. Integrate scoring rubric algorithmically into existing LLM explanation engine APIs to enable real-time scoring and transparent visualizations. 7. Pilot user studies with 60 practicing clinicians (sample size powering 80% statistical power, alpha=0.05) in controlled simulated clinical scenarios to measure trust dynamics, decision quality, and tool usability. 8. Perform iterative validation against standard NLP metrics and refine with clinician feedback. 9. Define phased milestones linked to measurable outcomes, with fallback plans prioritizing components based on incremental validation success.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "In a scenario where a clinician consults the LLM for a complex diagnostic query, the evaluator tool reports: (a) real-time bias risk scores derived from biomedical indexes, (b) clinician's trust propensity score informed by Big Five profile, (c) distress level inferred from dialogue affective analysis, and (d) transparent explanation metrics contextualizing these factors. The system dynamically alerts ethical compliance risks and recommends trust recalibration, supporting safer shared clinical decision-making.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should integration of all interdisciplinary components prove operationally complex, prioritization will be guided by empirical impact from pilot user studies: initially focusing on personality profiling combined with biomedical risk indexes, while refining affective state modules separately. Scoring heuristics will be simplified with iterative tuning informed by clinician usability feedback, ensuring a modular, progressively extensible framework compatible with existing clinical workflows and LLM explanation engines."

Clarify the methodologies for integrating these heterogeneous validity indicators into a coherent composite scoring rubric. Additionally, the plan would benefit from specifying metrics and sample sizes for the user studies with clinicians to ensure statistical power and reproducibility. Concrete tools and algorithms for integrating the composite validity indicators with LLM explanation engines should be outlined to increase feasibility and clarity of execution. Incorporating phased milestones with fallback strategies explicitly tied to experimentation outcomes will improve scientific soundness and practical execution clarity. This is crucial to avoid ambiguity and support effective implementation of the novel interdisciplinary framework proposed. Targeting this feedback first will strengthen the proposalâ€™s technical and operational rigor substantially, enabling more confident assessment of its practical impact and downstream deployment potential. This feedback targets the Experiment_Plan section specifically and is critical for successful project progression and resource prioritization."

Incorporating these elements could enrich the real-time user trust assessment modules by capturing nuanced clinician state or contextual factors influencing trust dynamics and decision quality. This integration would provide a multivariate, psychologically grounded layer to the validity indicators, enhancing ethical and human-centered dimensions and differentiating the framework within the human-centered computing and healthcare AI validation landscape.
