    "title": "Cross-Domain Privacy Benchmark Suite for Financial LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Absence of standardized benchmarks tailored for evaluating privacy-preserving LLM architectures within the financial domain hinders reproducibility and comparison.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap on tailored evaluation and external lack of cross-disciplinary standards by creating an extensive benchmark suite that incorporates financial, cryptographic, and regulatory metrics.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a composite benchmarking framework comprising multi-institutional privacy-sensitive datasets, cryptographic privacy leakage tests, financial-domain compliance scenarios, and formative assessment criteria. Enable leaderboards evaluating LLMs on utility, privacy-resilience, auditability, and regulatory adherence simultaneously.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Aggregate anonymized financial datasets respecting existing regulations. 2) Implement privacy leakage probing tools from cybersecurity research. 3) Define compliance evaluation scripts based on GDPR and CCPA rules. 4) Baseline state-of-the-art and emerging privacy-preserving LLM architectures. 5) Publish leaderboard results for community benchmarking.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Financial customer query sets synthetic and real. Output: Multiple evaluation metrics: accuracy, differential privacy budget consumption, regulatory compliance score, audit trail completeness, reported in a unified benchmark report.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If data collection proves challenging, simulate financial datasets with synthetic generation methods preserving distributional properties or limit benchmarks to privacy attacks and theoretical compliance models initially."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while generally sound and comprehensive, overlooks significant practical challenges around multi-institutional data aggregation, especially respecting strict financial privacy and regulatory constraints. The plan should elaborate more on concrete mechanisms and partnerships for legally-compliant data access and anonymization verification. Additionally, the fallback to fully synthetic data may severely limit realism and external validity, so hybrid approaches combining synthetic and carefully-vetted real data subsets should be considered to improve feasibility and credibility of benchmarks. Clearer risk mitigation strategies for these known constraints will strengthen the proposal's experimental feasibility and eventual impact potential.  \n\nRecommendation: Expand the Experiment_Plan to include detailed ethical and legal compliance workflows for data acquisition as well as validation protocols for synthetic data representativeness, potentially involving financial domain experts and privacy auditors early in the process to ensure the benchmark suite is robust and trustworthy for broad community adoption and effective leaderboards evaluation outputs.\n\nTarget section: \"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\""

          "feedback_content": "To transcend the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and enrich impact, I strongly recommend integrating advanced privacy enhancing technologies from the linked concepts such as differential privacy and federated learning directly into the benchmark design. Incorporating evaluation of models operating under federated learning or edge-cloud collaborative frameworks would reflect cutting-edge deployment scenarios in financial AI applications. Furthermore, embedding cryptographic protocols and real-time threat detection assessments aligns well with security-by-design frameworks and cybersecurity risks existing in financial systems. This integration not only extends the technical scope but increases the benchmark's utility for next-generation AI compliant with EU GDPR and CCPA regulations.\n\nExplicitly including these state-of-the-art secure and privacy-preserving computing paradigms alongside synthetic and real data evaluations will enhance differentiation, drive relevance in software development cycle contexts, and appeal to a broader interdisciplinary audience at the intersection of AI, finance, and cybersecurity.\n\nTarget section: \"Proposed_Method\""
