        "title": "Hierarchical Ontology-Grounded Legal LLM Explanations with Minimal Supervision",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current XAI techniques lack domain-adapted explainability methods customized for complex legal texts and large language models (LLMs). There is also insufficient integration of hierarchical legal ontologies and minimal user supervision to cost-effectively generate trustworthy explanations.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses critical gaps of lacking legal domain-specific explainability and ontology integration, plus user supervision scarcity. Innovatively combines hierarchical legal ontologies with minimal supervision strategies, creating semantically grounded, structured explanations unique to legal AI.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Build a novel explainability framework that overlays structured hierarchical legal ontologies on LLM outputs. Incorporate a minimal supervision annotation interface that leverages active learning with law experts to fine-tune explanation modules. The LLM generates candidate explanations, which are semantically matched and grounded in ontology nodes representing legal concepts, relationships, and regulations. This produces multi-level explanations at textual, conceptual, and legal taxonomic layers, ensuring fidelity and domain relevance.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate legal datasets annotated with hierarchical ontologies (e.g., statutes, case law taxonomies). 2. Integrate ontology embeddings into an LLM explainability pipeline trained to generate explanations aligned to ontology concepts. 3. Implement active learning with minimal expert annotations. 4. Compare against baseline LLM explainers without ontology or minimal supervision using metrics assessing semantic coherence, explanation faithfulness, and user trust via law practitioner studies.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Contract clause analyzing liability limitations. Output: Multi-level explanation linking clause semantics to specific ontology nodes (e.g., 'Force Majeure' in contract law hierarchy), highlighting reasoning steps referencing applicable regulations, with user-validated explanation segments.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If minimal supervision yields insufficient annotation data, integrate self-supervised learning to bootstrap ontology-aligned explanation embeddings. Alternatively, simulate expert inputs with augmented synthetic annotations based on legal knowledge bases."

        "title": "Cross-Modal Legal Explainability via Text-Image Fusion Networks",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing explainability techniques in legal LLMs rarely integrate multi-modal inputs despite legal documents containing rich visual evidence such as scanned contracts, charts, and exhibits, limiting holistic interpretability.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the gap identified around lack of fusion between textual legal AI and visual modalities, leveraging advances in vision-language models and decision fusion architectures from other AI fields to generate joint multimodal explanations tailored for complex legal contexts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid cross-modal fusion model combining a legal LLM with a visual encoder trained on legal document images. A decision fusion module aligns and integrates textual explanations with image segmentations and annotations to produce coherent, joint explanations that highlight both text and associated visual evidence (e.g., clause highlights with corresponding scanned images).",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect paired datasets of legal texts and corresponding document images (e.g., contracts with scanned exhibits). 2. Pretrain and fine-tune a text-language model and a vision transformer on legal image datasets. 3. Design a fusion module leveraging attention-based decision-level fusion to produce integrated explanations. 4. Evaluate on explainability benchmarks with metrics for alignment, user comprehension, and multi-modal explanation completeness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Contract clause plus scanned signature image. Output: Explanation that links meaning of clause with specific signature visible in image, highlighting both textual reasoning and visual validation of authenticity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If end-to-end fusion models underperform, implement modular pipelined architectures that generate separate textual and image explanations then align post hoc using similarity metrics. Alternatively, incorporate domain-adapted retrieval systems for visual context supplementation."

        "Proposed_Method": "Create a self-supervised pretraining framework for legal LLMs using proxy tasks like masked legal entity prediction, legal argument structure reconstruction, and cross-document entailment. Use these tasks to induce semantic representations that capture legal concepts and logical dependencies. Then fine-tune for explainability by generating semantic explanations grounded in learned representations, requiring minimal expert labeling for calibration.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect large-scale unlabeled legal corpora including statutes, case law, and contracts. 2. Design and train self-supervised proxy tasks that enforce semantic understanding. 3. Fine-tune models on small expert-labelled datasets for explanation generation. 4. Benchmark explainability quality against fully supervised baselines and assess scalability gains.",

        "Proposed_Method": "Design an explanation generator that produces contrastive explanations by contrasting predicted legal outcomes against plausible alternatives drawn from the legal ontology. The model leverages a dual-encoder architecture embedding legal concepts and case contexts, generating explanation segments that explicitly contrast and justify selected conclusions over alternatives in an interpretable, ontology-aware manner.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Construct a dataset of legal cases with annotated alternative outcomes and hierarchical legal concept tags. 2. Train dual-encoders to represent cases and legal concepts. 3. Develop a contrastive explanation generation module leveraging ontology-driven knowledge. 4. Evaluate explanation informativeness, user interpretability, and alignment with legal expert judgments.",
