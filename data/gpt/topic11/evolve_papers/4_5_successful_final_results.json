    "Problem_Statement": "LLM-based moderation often provides opaque decisions without clear rationale linking content to fairness or ethical standards related to ESG concerns.",
    "Motivation": "This responds directly to the gap of explainability and user-controllable transparency by embedding structured ESG reasoning chains within moderation explanations.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a modular explainable AI pipeline where LLM outputs are coupled with symbolic ESG reasoning modules. Moderation decisions are justified through stepwise reasoning over ESG criteria, producing human-readable, interactive explanations that users can query or contest. The framework supports variable granularity tailored to stakeholder needs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Identify ESG concepts relevant for content moderation.\n2) Develop symbolic logic rules encoding these concepts.\n3) Integrate with LLM decision outputs.\n4) Test on curated social media datasets.\n5) Evaluate explanation coherence, user understanding, and trust metrics compared to black-box models.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Post advocating environmental harm.\nOutput: Moderation rejects post due to violation of environmental ESG norms.\nExplanation: Step 1 - Post content promotes pollution.\nStep 2 - Conflicts with corporate environmental policies.\nStep 3 - Hence, moderation enforced due to sustainability violations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If symbolic ESG integration reduces model performance, fallback to post-hoc explanation generation or saliency-based visualization techniques with ESG keyword highlights."

        "title": "Explainable AI Pipeline Incorporating ESG Reasoning Chains for Transparent and Trustworthy Moderation with Human-Centered Adaptability",
        "Problem_Statement": "Content moderation using large language models (LLMs) often results in opaque decisions with insufficient clarity on how ethical, social, and governance (ESG) criteria inform these judgments. This opacity undermines user trust and limits the opportunity for contestation or understanding, particularly when moderation involves ambiguous or conflicting ESG principles that intersect with human rights and corporate ethics.",
        "Motivation": "Despite progress in explainable AI, existing moderation systems largely treat ESG considerations as black-box heuristics or isolated keywords, lacking robust, dynamic integration of ESG ethical reasoning. Our approach innovates by explicitly fusing symbolic ESG reasoning with probabilistic LLM outputs through a human-centered, modular pipeline that enables interactive, multi-granular explanations tailored to diverse stakeholder perspectives. By addressing the ethical landscape with transparency, interpretability, and adaptability, this fosters trust, meets real-world regulatory demands, and enhances the return on investment in responsible AI deployments beyond prior heuristic or post-hoc explanation methods.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid explainable AI framework that dynamically integrates LLM probabilistic outputs with symbolic ESG reasoning modules through an adaptive reasoning architecture. The architecture operates as follows: \n\n1) The LLM analyzes user-generated content and generates moderation candidate labels with associated confidence scores alongside natural language summaries.\n\n2) Simultaneously, a symbolic ESG knowledge base encodes human-rights-based ethical norms, corporate policies, and sustainability criteria into formal rules using computational intelligence techniques. These ESG rules are modular and hierarchically structured to support variable explanation granularity.\n\n3) An interpretability controller module performs conflict resolution by comparing LLM probabilistic inferences with symbolic logic outputs. If a conflict arises (e.g., LLM endorses content but ESG logic flags violation), a meta-reasoning protocol weighs source reliabilities, confidence levels, and stakeholder priorities to produce a reconciled moderation decision.\n\n4) The pipeline constructs stepwise, human-readable ESG reasoning chains by tracing rule activations combined with LLM context, generating interactive explanations with adjustable detail levels suited to specific stakeholder groups (e.g., users, moderators, corporate compliance officers).\n\n5) The pipeline supports interface mechanisms allowing end-users to query, contest, or request additional rationale, embodying a human-centered AI stance that respects user agency and supports ethical decision-making.\n\nThis design balances computational complexity with real-world applicability, enabling transparent, justifiable moderation that aligns with IT ethics and human rights perspectives while exploiting advanced intelligence techniques to enhance explainability and trustworthiness over traditional black-box models.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) ESG Concept and Rule Development: Collaborate with interdisciplinary experts to identify diverse ESG criteria relevant across different domains (environmental, social justice, governance), encoding them into formal symbolic rules supported by a knowledge representation scheme.\n\n2) Dataset Collection and Curation: Assemble a multi-source social media moderation dataset focusing on ESG-relevant cases, ensuring diversity across languages, cultures, and modalities. Annotate with expert labels incorporating ethical and corporate governance perspectives.\n\n3) System Integration: Develop and implement the reasoning pipeline integrating LLM outputs with ESG symbolic modules, including the conflict-resolution and explanation granularity mechanisms.\n\n4) Evaluation Metrics Design: Define operational, validated metrics for user understanding (e.g., comprehension tests), trust (e.g., trust calibration scales), and explanation fidelity (e.g., human-judged coherence). Include statistical baselines comparing with state-of-the-art black-box moderation models and fallback approaches (post-hoc explanations, saliency visualizations).\n\n5) User-Centered Experiments: Recruit representative stakeholder groups (lay users, content moderators, compliance officers) to evaluate variable explanation granularity interfaces interacting with the pipeline; collect qualitative and quantitative data on explanation utility and affective trust.\n\n6) Statistical Analysis: Employ rigorous statistical methods to analyze performance on moderation accuracy, explanation effectiveness, trust calibration, and user satisfaction, including ablation studies on conflict resolution and reasoning chain components.\n\n7) Contingency and Robustness Testing: Explore failure modes, including situations where symbolic rules conflict with LLM outputs to assess fallback strategies and their impact on overall system robustness and user perceptions.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: A social media post stating, \"Dumping toxic waste into rivers is our right if it boosts profits.\"\n\nModeration Output: Post flagged and removed due to violation of ESG norms.\n\nExplanation via Reasoning Chain: \nStep 1: LLM detects promotion of environmentally harmful behavior with high confidence.\nStep 2: Symbolic ESG logic identifies conflict with environmental protection laws, corporate sustainability commitments, and human rights obligations concerning safe water.\nStep 3: Conflict resolution module confirms consensus; ESG rules have precedence in this context.\nStep 4: Interactive explanation generated at variable granularity: \n - For general users: \"Post promotes pollution against environmental protection norms.\"\n - For compliance officers: \"Violation of local environmental regulations and corporate sustainable finance policies detected, conflicting with human rights to safe water access.\" \nUsers can query the basis for any step or request additional context.\n\nAlternate Scenario: If LLM outputs ambiguous or borderline confidence scores, the system highlights uncertainty and prompts for moderator review, illustrating transparency in ambiguous ESG interpretation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should integration of symbolic ESG reasoning significantly degrade moderation accuracy or responsiveness, fallback strategies include:\n\n1) Employing post-hoc explanation generation techniques that produce ESG-relevant rationale derived from LLM attention and output probabilities.\n\n2) Utilizing saliency-based visualizations to highlight ESG-related keyword contexts within content, supporting user interpretability.\n\n3) Iteratively refining symbolic rule sets based on failure analyses and expert feedback to better align symbolic constraints with LLM probabilistic behavior.\n\n4) Incorporating human-in-the-loop moderation support where automated ESG reasoning is inconclusive to preserve trust and compliance.\n\nThese fallback plans maintain a compromise between explainability and operational performance while informing progressive improvements toward the full hybrid pipeline."
