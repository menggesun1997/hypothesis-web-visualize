    "title": "Blockchain-Enabled Auditable Privacy Framework for Financial LLM Transactions",
    "Problem_Statement": "Traceability and auditability of data and model transactions in privacy-preserving financial LLMs are insufficient, impacting trust and compliance.",
    "Motivation": "Exploits the external gap by bridging blockchain-ledger technology with privacy-preserving AI to ensure immutable audit trails and regulatory-proof logging of data access and model interactions.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Integrate a permissioned blockchain ledger that records encrypted transaction metadata from LLM training and inference events. Smart contracts enforce compliance rules automatically; auditors retrieve verifiable, tamper-proof evidence without accessing raw data, thus preserving privacy while enabling accountability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Pilot integration of blockchain middleware with federated privacy-preserving LLM workflows. 2) Define data schemas for transaction metadata capturing compliance markers. 3) Simulate financial queries and record audit-relevant events. 4) Test scalability, privacy leakage, and audit process efficiency. 5) Conduct stakeholder usability studies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A model update event from federated training recorded on-chain. Output: Auditors pull cryptographically verifiable records showing data provenance, participant consent, and privacy protocol enforcement without exposure of sensitive content.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain integration adds overhead, explore off-chain logging solutions with cryptographic proofs (e.g., Merkle trees) balancing privacy, throughput, and auditability."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method would benefit from a more detailed and explicit explanation of how encrypted transaction metadata is generated, structured, and linked on the permissioned blockchain. Currently, it is unclear how smart contracts will enforce compliance without access to raw data, and how auditors verify adherence without privacy leakage. Clarify the cryptographic techniques (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs, attribute-based encryption) enabling privacy-preserving, tamper-proof auditability, and how performance constraints of running LLM-related events on blockchain are overcome or mitigated. Providing a concrete architecture or protocol outline will strengthen soundness and reproducibility prospects well before experimental testing phases commence. This clarity is essential to validate core assumptions about privacy, auditability, and compliance enforcement within the proposed blockchain framework. This addresses the insight under the Proposed_Method section on mechanism soundness and trustworthiness of the approach itself.  \n\nFurthermore, consider explicit adversarial threat models (both malicious actors and collusion risks) to demonstrate robustness and ensure no hidden assumptions are embedded in the method's trust model. This would significantly improve rigor and confidence in the approach's soundness. \n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"

Details such as access to suitable federated LLM systems with realistic financial datasets, specifics on how metadata schemas will be designed to capture all necessary compliance markers, and metrics for evaluating privacy leakage and audit efficiency are currently vague or missing.\n\nImportantly, pilot studies should specify evaluation criteria for scalability (e.g., blockchain transaction throughput caps vs. expected LLM event frequency) and privacy leakage quantification methods (e.g., information-theoretic or empirical privacy metrics). The plan also omits how usability studies will be concretely structured for auditors and other stakeholders (e.g., tasks, questionnaires, or usage logs) to measure system effectiveness in real-world audit scenarios.\n\nAdding fallback mechanisms and measurable baseline comparisons (such as classical logging or off-chain cryptographic proofs) experimentally will provide context on tradeoffs and feasibility. Clear sequencing and feasibility timelines, as well as resource requirements (computational, data access, consortium partners), should also be articulated.\n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
