    "title": "Multi-Modal Privacy-Ensuring Financial LLMs Combining Text and Structured Data",
    "Problem_Statement": "Financial data often spans heterogeneous modalities—text, time series, tabular data—posing challenges for privacy-preserving LLMs designed primarily for text.",
    "Motivation": "Targets internal gaps in domain adaptation by innovatively extending privacy-preserving architectures to multi-modal financial data fusion, integrating cross-disciplinary data privacy and AI modalities research.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct an LLM architecture combining transformer-based language understanding with structured data encoders under unified privacy-preserving constraints. Employ federated multi-modal training augmented with modality-specific encryption and differential privacy for each data stream, enabling coherent and secure financial analysis.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect paired financial textual and tabular datasets (e.g., analyst reports and market data). 2) Implement modulated privacy layers for each modality. 3) Train multi-modal LLMs federated across institutions. 4) Benchmark utility against single-modal models and measure end-to-end privacy leakage metrics. 5) Assess regulatory compliance via cross-modal output auditing.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Customer complaint text alongside their transaction history. Output: Contextually accurate response preserving privacy across both modalities, e.g., advising remedy actions without disclosing sensitive structured data.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If modality encryption impairs fusion, consider late-fusion or hybrid ensemble approaches where modalities remain private but combined outputs respect privacy constraints."

          "feedback_content": "The architecture combining transformer-based language understanding with structured data encoders under unified privacy constraints is an ambitious core element, but the mechanism for modality-specific encryption integration and how privacy-preserving constraints interact across modalities requires clearer explication. Specifically, how the model maintains alignment or fusion fidelity under differential privacy and encryption in federated multi-modal contexts is under-specified, risking issues with joint representation learning and gradient aggregation. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed theoretical or architectural diagram showing how modalities are fused securely without losing critical signal or incurring prohibitive noise from privacy mechanisms, including fallback technical specifics beyond the high-level late-fusion concept presented. Clarify how cross-modal coherence will be quantitatively ensured under these constraints to solidify the soundness of the core approach in handling heterogenous financial data streams securely and effectively at scale.  This is essential given the complexity and privacy sensitivity in financial domains, making this a top-priority to target for robustness and clarity before proceeding to experiments or deployment scenarios.

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan is comprehensive but lacks critical operational details that could undermine its feasibility. For example, collecting paired multi-modal financial datasets (text and structured data) that are institutionally federated yet privacy compliant is non-trivial, with little discussion on data acquisition challenges, standardization, and regulatory constraints. Additionally, modality-specific privacy layers and federated training might introduce significant overhead and convergence issues that are not addressed. The plan should incorporate concrete strategies for dataset harmonization, simulation or pilot studies to validate privacy-enabling layers independently before full multi-modal federated training, and detailed fallback or contingency protocols beyond a generic late-fusion approach. Also, the methods for auditing regulatory compliance across modalities need clearer operationalization, potentially involving automated tools or formal verification frameworks to assess nuanced data leakage risks. Improving these experiment design facets is critical before solidifying the viability of the approach in real-world noisy, regulated financial settings. (Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)"
