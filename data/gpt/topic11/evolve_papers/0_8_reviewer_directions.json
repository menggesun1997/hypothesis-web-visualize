    "title": "Integrative Psychological and Political Bias Regularization in LLM Objective Functions",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM training objectives insufficiently penalize propagation of psychological and political bias patterns present in clinical language, perpetuating fairness issues and hallucinations affecting healthcare outcomes.",
    "Motivation": "This idea confronts the internal gap by formalizing psychological and political bias signals as explicit regularization terms in LLM training objectives, pioneering principled, quantifiable bias suppression embedded during model optimization.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Incorporate multi-task loss functions combining standard MLM or autoregressive objectives with additional regularizers derived from psychological trait classification errors and political bias intensity estimations. These bias components utilize auxiliary neural modules trained to detect and score bias-related features, encouraging the LLM toward neutral latent representations and reducing biased output tokens without degrading medical knowledge retention.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Construct bias detection modules (e.g., dark trait classifiers). 2. Integrate these as auxiliary losses during LLM fine-tuning on healthcare corpora. 3. Benchmark against models without bias regularization on clinical QA, hallucination, and fairness metrics. 4. Perform ablation studies to balance bias suppression and clinical accuracy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical question with subtle ideological framing; output demonstrates reduced biased token generation with maintained factual correctness.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If bias regularization hurts model knowledge, employ softer penalty weights or gradient surgery techniques to preserve essential domain capabilities."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that psychological and political biases present in clinical language can be accurately and reliably detected and quantified by auxiliary neural modules is not sufficiently justified. Clinical language is complex, nuanced, and context-dependent, and political or psychological biases may manifest subtly or ambiguously. Without rigorous validation of the bias detection modulesâ€™ capability to generalize effectively on healthcare data, the proposed regularization risks penalizing essential clinical content or missing key bias patterns, undermining fairness goals. The authors should strengthen the rationale with preliminary evidence or citations demonstrating feasibility of extracting such bias signals from clinical corpora and clarify how they ensure these signals do not overlap undesirably with legitimate clinical terms or patient descriptors in medical text data. Providing a risk analysis of false positives and negatives from bias modules would bolster soundness of this assumption in the Proposed_Method section to increase confidence in approach viability and mitigate unintended consequences during LLM training convergence."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The experimental plan is relatively high-level and misses key details critical for reproducibility and validity. In particular, specifics on datasets (clinical corpora size, diversity, bias prevalence), bias detection module architectures, training regime (e.g., balancing auxiliary losses against primary LLM objectives), and evaluation metrics (standards for measuring hallucination, fairness, and clinical accuracy quantitatively) are not discussed. The plan also lacks consideration of potential confounders like domain shifts and label noise in bias annotations. To improve feasibility and scientific rigor, the authors should flesh out these methodological elements, include appropriate baselines (e.g., state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods in clinical NLP), and outline statistical protocols (like cross-validation or significance testing) to attribute observed improvements specifically to their bias regularization. Detailing fallback parameter tuning ranges for penalty weights and defining criteria for ablation study relevance would further strengthen practical experiment execution assurances in the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section."
