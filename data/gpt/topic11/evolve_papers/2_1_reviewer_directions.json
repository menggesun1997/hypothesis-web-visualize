    "title": "Cross-Modal Legal Explainability via Text-Image Fusion Networks",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing explainability techniques in legal LLMs rarely integrate multi-modal inputs despite legal documents containing rich visual evidence such as scanned contracts, charts, and exhibits, limiting holistic interpretability.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the gap identified around lack of fusion between textual legal AI and visual modalities, leveraging advances in vision-language models and decision fusion architectures from other AI fields to generate joint multimodal explanations tailored for complex legal contexts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid cross-modal fusion model combining a legal LLM with a visual encoder trained on legal document images. A decision fusion module aligns and integrates textual explanations with image segmentations and annotations to produce coherent, joint explanations that highlight both text and associated visual evidence (e.g., clause highlights with corresponding scanned images).",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect paired datasets of legal texts and corresponding document images (e.g., contracts with scanned exhibits). 2. Pretrain and fine-tune a text-language model and a vision transformer on legal image datasets. 3. Design a fusion module leveraging attention-based decision-level fusion to produce integrated explanations. 4. Evaluate on explainability benchmarks with metrics for alignment, user comprehension, and multi-modal explanation completeness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Contract clause plus scanned signature image. Output: Explanation that links meaning of clause with specific signature visible in image, highlighting both textual reasoning and visual validation of authenticity.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If end-to-end fusion models underperform, implement modular pipelined architectures that generate separate textual and image explanations then align post hoc using similarity metrics. Alternatively, incorporate domain-adapted retrieval systems for visual context supplementation."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed method outlines a cross-modal fusion model combining a legal language model with a vision encoder and a decision fusion module, the precise mechanism for aligning textual explanations with image segmentations remains insufficiently detailed. Clarify how attention mechanisms will specifically enable coherent, interpretable joint explanations rather than independent outputs; e.g., describe the decision fusion architecture, how alignment handles modality heterogeneity, and how explainability will be quantitatively measured. Providing architectural diagrams or pseudocode could strengthen the soundness of the method's design assumptions and facilitate reproducibility assessments, which is critical given the complex multimodal integration envisioned in legal contexts where precision is paramount. Enhancing methodological clarity will also help differentiate the approach from existing multimodal fusion techniques in competitive literature areas, thus supporting novelty claims and feasibility evaluations effectively in upcoming experimental stages.  Target improvements here before investing heavily in extensive dataset collection or training phases to avoid compounding ambiguities downstream in experiments and evaluations, which currently may undermine confidence in the core technical contribution and explainability claims presented in the proposal's core innovation package (Proposed_Method). This clarification will also aid reviewers and end users in trusting the model's interpretability capacities, essential for legal domain deployment safety and acceptance.  Please expand and concretize the fusion and explanation generation mechanisms, emphasizing interpretability and modality synergy for soundness assurance and real-world impact readiness per your cross-modal legal explainability claim!

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict 'NOV-COMPETITIVE' in a field densely populated with multimodal fusion and explainability research, strategically augment your proposed pipeline by integrating intelligent decision-making frameworks and domain-adapted retrieval systems tightly into your fusion architecture rather than only as a fallback. Specifically, you can enhance the fusion model by leveraging recent vision-language XAI approaches equipped with attention mechanisms that enable interpretable multi-modal rationale extraction. Moreover, incorporate the structured knowledge in legal ontologies or knowledge graphs to contextualize visual and textual cues, thereby boosting explanation completeness and alignment accuracy. Leveraging publicly available specialized image datasets alongside domain knowledge can elevate the model's ability to generate legally grounded and semantically enriched joint explanations. Such globally-informed integration will position your work to rise above competitive local novelty by embedding state-of-the-art research challenges in multi-modal XAI and intelligent decision-making tailored to legal AI. This booster also opens avenues for broader impact and cross-disciplinary collaboration, enriching the idea beyond its current scope and strengthening claims related to holistic legal interpretability and AI transparency. Embedding these concepts early will streamline later experimental phases and substantially bolster soundness and impact, making your contribution more compelling and distinctive at premier venues like ACL or NeurIPS.
