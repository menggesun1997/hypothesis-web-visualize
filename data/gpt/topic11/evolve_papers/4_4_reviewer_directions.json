    "title": "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) Framework for Collective Ethical Moderation Oversight",
    "Problem_Statement": "Centralized social media moderation lacks participatory mechanisms for decentralized, community-driven ethical oversight ensuring accountability and fairness.",
    "Motivation": "Building on external gaps related to decentralized structures, this proposal introduces DAO principles for community governance of AI moderation policies, increasing transparency and embedding ethics democratically.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement a DAO on blockchain enabling users, moderators, and experts to propose, vote, and enforce moderation guidelines affecting LLM behavior. The system logs all votes and policy changes immutably. The LLM adapts its moderation models dynamically according to DAO-approved ethical constraints and community standards, with auditability and dispute mediation baked in.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop DAO governance smart contracts and interfaces.\n2) Integrate LLM with policy control module listening to DAO inputs.\n3) Deploy on test social platform.\n4) Measure community engagement, decision transparency, and moderation fairness.\n5) Conduct user trust surveys comparing DAO vs. centralized moderation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Controversial content flagged differently under evolving community standards.\nOutput: DAO votes lead to updated moderation parameters; decisions reflect collective ethics.\nExplanation: Transparent policy adjustment traces enable accountability.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If DAO governance slows moderation decisions, introduce hierarchical voting or expert override mechanisms to balance agility and participation."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines using a DAO to govern AI moderation dynamically via community votes recorded immutably on blockchain. However, the mechanism explaining precisely how LLM moderation models will adapt in response to DAO decisions is insufficiently detailed. Clarify the technical interfaces between the DAO's policy outputs and the LLM's moderation layers, specifying how policy changes translate into modulated behavior, how real-time adaptation occurs with minimal latency, and how conflicts between ethical constraints and model behavior are resolved. Without these details, the soundness of the approach is unclear and the innovation cannot be effectively assessed or reproduced, limiting credibility and impact potential. Consider including modular architectural diagrams or prototypes clarifying this interaction depth and addressing potential failure modes to strengthen the methodâ€™s rigor and clarity within the paper's Proposed_Method section."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is conceptually sound but lacks critical practical details that affect feasibility and validity of results: 1) It should specify metrics and quantitative measures for community engagement, decision transparency, and moderation fairness to enable objective evaluation rather than qualitative assessments. 2) The plan omits considerations about the test social platform scale, user recruitment, and demographic representation, which are pivotal for realistic community governance dynamics. 3) Address potential performance bottlenecks that may arise from blockchain transaction times or voting aggregation delays, and explicitly tie the fallback mechanisms (hierarchical voting or expert overrides) into experimental conditions to measure their effect on system agility and impact. Enhancing the experimental design with these specifics will improve feasibility confirmation and strengthen the contribution's validation rigor."
