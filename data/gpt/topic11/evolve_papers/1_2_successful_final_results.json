        "title": "Regulatory-Driven Explainable AI Framework with Privacy-by-Design and Attribute-Based Access Controls for Auditable Financial LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing privacy-preserving financial LLMs often lack systematic transparency, explainability, and auditable compliance mechanisms, which risks violating regulations such as GDPR, hinders stakeholder trust, and complicates regulatory verification in high-stakes financial domains.",
        "Motivation": "While privacy-preserving LLMs and AI explainability have been separately explored, there remains a critical gap in integrating cross-disciplinary expertise—AI, legal frameworks, security management, and platform integration—to develop a truly regulatory-aligned, explainable, and auditable financial LLM framework. By embedding privacy-by-design principles and attribute-based access control (ABAC) models into LLM architectures, our approach ensures fine-grained, policy-driven data governance and active compliance traceability. This integration advances beyond post-hoc explanations by building proactive, compliance-aware decision-support capabilities that map model rationales directly to regulatory clauses, empowering financial institutions to meet stringent auditing standards and fostering adoption in operational environments. These novel contributions address the NOV-COMPETITIVE context by deeply integrating legal decision-making, privacy architecture, and platform extensibility into LLM explainability.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular, extensible framework that layers on privacy-by-design and ABAC-enforced policy management into privacy-preserving financial LLMs. Core components include: 1) Policy Engine - encoding regulatory rules and attribute-based access controls managing data usage per-context; 2) Compliance-Aware Explainability Module - generates multi-modal, structured rationales explicitly linked to relevant regulatory clauses via a legal knowledge graph and AI integration techniques; 3) Auditable Provenance Logger - captures fine-grained data flow, access rights, model decisions, and compliance checkpoints to enable transparent third-party audits; 4) Regulatory Expert-in-the-Loop Validation Interface supporting iterative expert reviews with standardized interpretability metrics and trust quantification. The framework is designed for seamless platform integration adhering to security management best practices. By proactively embedding legal decision-making semantics and security controls, our method transcends conventional post-hoc explanation systems, enhancing both regulatory alignment and operational viability in financial contexts.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset & Environment Setup: Select representative financial datasets with clear compliance constraints; implement ABAC policies reflecting domain regulations; set up a secure, privacy-preserving training pipeline with reproducibility protocols. 2) Model Training & Integration: Train privacy-preserving LLMs enhanced with embedded ABAC and privacy-by-design principles. 3) Explainability Module Development: Build and integrate the compliance-aware explainability system linking model outputs to a curated regulatory knowledge graph. 4) Validation & Auditing: (a) Select regulatory experts with defined qualifications (e.g., certified compliance officers, financial lawyers) through formal criteria; (b) Develop and employ objective interpretability metrics (e.g., fidelity, completeness, and regulatory mapping accuracy) and standardized trust measurements (Likert surveys, quantitative trust scores); (c) Conduct compliance audits using third-party audit teams blinded to model internals, assessing provenance logs and compliance checkpoints. 5) Scalability & Reproducibility Analysis: Benchmark training and inference times at varying dataset scales; document procedures for reproducible deployment. 6) Stakeholder Engagement: Perform quantitative and qualitative assessments of trust and usability with financial stakeholders via structured interviews and surveys. All steps incorporate rigorous documentation and anonymized audit trails to foster transparency and real-world applicability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An LLM-generated loan approval decision for a customer profile. Output: (1) ABAC-enforced data access summary showing which customer attributes and financial records were accessed under applicable privacy policies, (2) a multi-layered explanation: textual rationale mapping decision factors to specific regulatory clauses (e.g., GDPR Article 5 fairness principle, local financial regulations), accompanied by visual data flow diagrams illustrating provenance and compliance checkpoints, (3) detailed audit logs enabling third-party compliance auditors to trace data usage, model reasoning, and regulatory alignment stepwise. This holistic output enables auditors and stakeholders to verify decision legitimacy, privacy adherence, and regulatory compliance comprehensively and reproducibly.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If integrating privacy-by-design principles or ABAC impacts model performance or explainability adversely, investigate adaptive privacy-aware neural saliency and synthetic rationale generation techniques that minimize sensitive data exposure while preserving regulatory relevance. Additionally, consider a hybrid approach combining rule-based compliance verification overlays with simplified explainability outputs to balance privacy, interpretability, and auditability under operational constraints without compromising fundamental compliance goals."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while logically ordered, lacks clarity on how the compliance audits and expert reviews will be systematically conducted and measured. For instance, it should specify criteria for selecting regulatory experts, define objective metrics for interpretability validation, and describe how trust metrics will be quantitatively analyzed or benchmarked. Furthermore, scalability and reproducibility considerations for training privacy-preserving LLMs on financial datasets should be addressed to enhance practical feasibility and scientific rigor. Providing these details will strengthen confidence that the plan can concretely demonstrate effectiveness and compliance adherence rather than remain conceptual or anecdotal, ensuring the feasibility of carrying out the proposed evaluation fully and transparently in a real-world regulatory context. This is critical because privacy and compliance verification often require domain-specific rigor and well-defined experimental protocols to be credible and accepted by stakeholders and regulators alike, which should be explicitly planned and articulated here in the experimental design steps to reduce implementation risk and provide trustworthy evidence for impact claims. Targeting enhancements in this section will ground the ambitious proposal within concrete achievable milestones and evidentiary methods, improving feasibility substantially without undermining the innovation goals inherent in the idea's cross-disciplinary integration approach.

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty rating as NOV-COMPETITIVE, the proposal should integrate relevant globally-linked concepts such as 'privacy-by-design' and 'attribute-based access control' to enhance both technical depth and regulatory alignment. Specifically, the framework could incorporate attribute-based access control models directly into the privacy-preserving LLM architecture to enforce fine-grained, policy-driven data access, improving both explainability and compliance traceability. Including concepts from 'security management' and 'platform integration' may facilitate building a modular, extensible toolkit that can be seamlessly adopted in operational financial systems and audited environments. Additionally, drawing inspiration from 'legal decision-making' and 'AI integration' research could help formalize the linkage between model rationales and specific regulatory clauses, thus elevating the framework beyond a post-hoc explanation system to a proactive compliance-aware decision-support system. By adopting such global integration strategies, the research can substantially differentiate itself in a competitive field and potentially increase its impact and adoption in practical regulatory and financial technology settings.
