        "title": "Adaptive Self-Supervised Energy Profiling for Diverse Large Language Model Training Frameworks",
        "Problem_Statement": "Quantifying energy consumption during large language model (LLM) training currently requires direct hardware instrumentation, which is often non-scalable and disruptive across diverse computing environments. Internal training signals like loss curves and gradient norms are promising proxies but their correlation with actual energy usage is influenced by hardware-specific behaviors such as power management features, thermal throttling, and dynamic resource allocation. These factors introduce noise and nonlinearities, challenging consistent, generalizable energy estimation across architectures and deployment contexts. To enable non-intrusive and scalable energy profiling, it is critical to explicitly model and address these hardware-specific variations and uncertainties.",
        "Motivation": "Existing methods for energy profiling in LLM training either rely on costly hardware metering or lack robustness across heterogeneous environments, limiting their utility for wider ecological and operational optimization. Our approach introduces an adaptive self-supervised framework that leverages internal signals while explicitly accounting for hardware-dependent power characteristics, improving predictive accuracy and generalization. By integrating concepts from neural architecture search, we dynamically tailor model components to hardware classes, enabling hierarchical calibration reflecting hardware and training mode heterogeneity. This novel strategy transcends prior work by providing a scalable, interpretable energy profiling solution that fosters real-time environmental impact assessment and adaptive green optimization without intrusive instrumentation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "1) Collect synchronized training logs and precise energy measurements from a curated and diverse set of hardware platforms (including GPUs from multiple vendors, TPUs, and CPUs), varied training configurations, and LLM architectures to capture representative operational scenarios. 2) Analyze the stability and correlation of internal training signals (loss, gradient norms, batch sizes) with ground truth energy consumption, identifying hardware-specific nonlinearities and noise patterns. 3) Develop an adaptive hierarchical regression framework with dedicated branches or modules per hardware family and training regime, incorporating a meta-controller inspired by neural architecture search methods to dynamically calibrate model structure and parameters to the hardware context. 4) Employ self-supervised learning to exploit abundant unlabeled training signals augmented by limited ground truth measurements, refined through semi-supervised fine-tuning. 5) Validate predictive accuracy, robustness to load variance, and latency overhead across unseen hardware-model pairs. 6) Integrate the predictor into live training loops for dynamic energy estimation and feedback-driven optimization. 7) Provide interpretability modules highlighting signal contributions and uncertainty metrics to enhance trustworthiness. This method merges deep learning techniques, adaptive meta-learning, and domain insights on hardware power behaviors to realize a robust, scalable, and generalizable energy profiler.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Step 1: Hardware and Dataset Selection - Identify representative hardware platforms across major families (e.g., NVIDIA A100, AMD MI250, Google TPU v4, high-end CPUs) and define varied large language model training configurations (sizes, batch sizes, optimizers). Step 2: Data Collection - Instrument training jobs to collect fine-grained synchronized logs of internal signals with wall-clock timestamps alongside integrated hardware power meters (e.g., NVIDIA DCGM, RAPL counters, external power meters). Step 3: Preliminary Analysis - Compute correlation statistics and visualize signal-energy relationships per hardware type to assess signal quality and identify confounding factors like thermal throttling events. Step 4: Model Development - Design the hierarchical adaptive regression model combining hardware-class branches and a meta-controller learned via a neural architecture search-inspired algorithm. Step 5: Training & Fine-Tuning - Train the self-supervised model on partially labeled data, conduct semi-supervised fine-tuning as needed, monitor training convergence, and validate on hold-out hardware-model pairs. Step 6: Evaluation - Measure prediction accuracy (mean absolute percentage error, robustness under varying loads), latency overhead during live inference, and interpretability via feature importance analyses. Step 7: Integration & Stress Test - Embed the predictor within training loops of selected LLMs, assess real-time energy estimation fidelity, and analyze feedback potential for green training optimization. Step 8: Baseline Comparison - Compare against hardware meter readings and state-of-the-art external approaches focusing on accuracy, scalability, system overhead, and robustness metrics. Step 9: Failure Diagnosis - Implement early warning diagnostics detecting when signal-hardware correlation degrades to trigger fallback strategies (hardware-specific or semi-supervised adjustments). Step 10: Documentation & Open Release - Publish methodology, datasets, and toolkits to foster community replication and extension.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: Input - NVIDIA A100 GPU training logs for a 7B parameter LLM, including iteration number, batch size, loss, and gradient norms. Output - Predicted per-iteration energy consumption within 5% mean absolute error compared to DCGM power meter readings, stable across thermal throttling events. Example 2: Input - TPU v4 training signals from a large-scale training run with dynamic batch sizes and learning rates. Output - Energy estimates robust to power-state transitions, validated by external power measurements with dynamic load. Example 3: Input - AMD MI250 GPU logs during mixed precision training with resource scaling. Output - Accurate energy prediction enabling live feedback without explicit power meters, facilitating green optimization. Example 4: Input - CPU-based fine-tuning with variable frequency scaling. Output - Energy consumption predictions that adapt to hardware-specific power management, supported by hierarchical model components. In all examples, predictor latency remains below 5ms per iteration, and uncertainty estimates flag low-confidence predictions prompting fallback mechanisms.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If initial assumptions on stable correlations prove insufficient for certain hardware families or dynamic training modes, the following steps will mitigate risks: 1) Expand semi-supervised learning with richer labeled datasets per problematic hardware type to improve domain adaptation. 2) Employ transfer learning by training separate specialized submodels per hardware class, as suggested by early diagnostics. 3) Introduce online adaptive calibration modules that adjust prediction parameters during training to handle runtime power management effects dynamically. 4) Explore additional internal signals and external low-cost telemetry (e.g., operating system performance counters) to enrich feature sets. 5) If integration overhead is too high, implement asynchronous prediction with buffered data aggregation to minimize latency impact. This pragmatic fallback ensures robustness and incremental improvements while preserving the core aim of scalable, non-intrusive energy profiling."

          "feedback_content": "The fundamental assumption that internal training signals such as loss curves and gradient norms correlate consistently and predictably with energy consumption across diverse hardware is ambitious but not sufficiently justified. Hardware-specific energy behaviors, thermal throttling, and power management optimizations may introduce noise or non-linearities that challenge this assumption. It is essential to include a more detailed analysis or preliminary evidence supporting the stability and generalizability of these signals as predictors across architectures and hardware platforms. Clarifying these assumptions upfront will strengthen the core premise and guide more targeted model design or data collection strategies where this assumption fails, such as hardware families with varying power characteristics or training regimes with dynamic resource allocation techniques. Consider expanding the Problem Statement or Proposed_Method to address and mitigate these potential confounds explicitly, possibly via adaptive calibration or hierarchical model components representing hardware classes or training modes separately, to enhance robustness and trustworthiness of predictions across settings. This is critical because the method relies on these signals exclusively to replace direct power measurements, which are hardware-dependent by nature, thus this assumption governs the soundness of the entire approach.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The proposed experiment plan outlines a sensible sequence but lacks sufficient detail on how training logs and energy ground truth will be acquired at scale across diverse hardware and models, which is critical for obtaining representative and generalizable data. The plan should explicitly specify the hardware types, models, and training configurations targeted for data collection to assess coverage and represent diversity realistically. Additionally, mechanisms for synchronizing timestamps between training signals and energy measurements need clarification to ensure accurate labeling for model training. The fallback strategy mentions semi-supervised fine-tuning or per-hardware models, indicating possible challenges with generalization; the plan should incorporate evaluation criteria or diagnostics early to detect and quantify such failures. Furthermore, integrating the predictor with live training loops (step 4) may face engineering complexities, which should be accounted for, with risk mitigation steps. Finally, a structured baseline comparison with hardware meters (step 5) must define metrics beyond average error, such as robustness across load conditions or latency impact during training. More rigorous experimental design and operational details are needed to fully establish feasibility and effectiveness of this self-supervised energy profiling approach."
