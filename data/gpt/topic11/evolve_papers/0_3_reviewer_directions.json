    "title": "Causal Mediation Networks Integrating Dark Trait Linguistics for Bias Source Attribution",
    "Problem_Statement": "Biases in healthcare LLMs often stem from entangled psychological and political influences embedded in textual training data, yet methods to causally attribute and untangle these bias sources remain undeveloped, limiting effective mitigation.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient nuanced bias mitigation by combining causal mediation analysis with novel linguistic feature extraction of dark personality traits, enabling interpretable bias source separation tailored for clinical language.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a causal mediation framework that models pathways from input linguistic features (tagged for dark trait markers) through intermediate biased latent variables to LLM outputs. Use structural causal models aligned with textual embeddings to quantify mediation effects of identified psychological biases on clinical predictions. This enables targeted data augmentation or model interventions focusing on the root causal biases rather than surface correlations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect clinical text corpora annotated for dark trait linguistic markers and political bias. 2. Define causal graphs and mediators reflecting bias mechanisms. 3. Train LLMs with mediation-informed regularization. 4. Run bias source attribution experiments comparing standard and mediation-aware models. Metrics: bias causal effect size, clinical prediction accuracy, fairness improvement.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient note with subtle political bias linguistic features. Output: Quantitative mediation attribution scores indicating how much each bias-related latent variable influences output inaccuracies.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If causal mediation modeling proves unstable, apply approximate mediation via proxy variables or explore instrumental variable techniques to isolate bias influences."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a sophisticated causal mediation framework leveraging dark trait linguistic markers and latent biased variables, but it lacks clarity on how these latent variables will be identified or validated within the model. The causal graphs and structural causal models need further specification, especially regarding how textual embeddings align with causally meaningful mediators and whether the markers for dark traits can validly capture psychological states rather than correlational signals. To improve, explicitly define the causal variable selection process, the identification strategy for mediators in text, and clarify assumptions required for causal claims to hold in this complex high-dimensional setting, ensuring the soundness of mediation interpretations in LLM outputs. This will strengthen the theoretical grounding and reproducibility of the mediation analysis approach in the clinical NLP context, reducing potential confounds or spurious mediation pathways that undermine bias attribution accuracy.

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan ambitiously covers collection, modeling, and evaluation but underestimates the challenges in obtaining clinical text corpora adequately annotated for both dark personality linguistic markers and political bias at sufficient scale and granularity. Annotation complexity and subjectivity may hamper data quality and reproducibility. Additionally, incorporating mediation-informed regularization into LLM training is highly non-trivial and merits a more detailed procedural breakdown or pilot validation step to assess stability and convergence. To enhance feasibility, propose incremental validation experiments focusing initially on synthetic or semi-synthetic data to prove mediation effect estimation reliability, and provide fallback timelines and quantitative criteria to judge when to switch to proxy or instrumental variable methods. Articulating concrete annotation strategies, sample size estimates, and model training safeguards will ensure the experiment plan is grounded and achievable.
