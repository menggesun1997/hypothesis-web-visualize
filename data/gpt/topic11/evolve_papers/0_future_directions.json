        "title": "Dark-Triad-Informed Bias Filtration for Clinical LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs used in healthcare harbor subtle ideological and personality-driven biases, notably political and dark personality trait influences, which impair fairness and decision accuracy in clinical contexts. There is no integrated approach to detect and mitigate these nuanced biases during LLM generation.",
        "Motivation": "This project addresses the critical external gap of integrating dark personality trait theory into bias mitigation for healthcare LLMs, innovating beyond descriptive bias evaluation methods by embedding psychological trait frameworks directly within mitigation techniques.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-stage LLM fine-tuning and inference pipeline that leverages psychological dark triad trait embedding models and political bias classifiers. During fine-tuning, the LLM is regularized using adversarial objectives derived from synthetic perturbations representing dark trait linguistic patterns. At inference, output filtering scores align with personality-based bias likelihoods, rejecting or re-ranking biased responses dynamically. The approach fuses trait theory-derived embeddings with causal mediation analysis to disentangle bias manifestation pathways, enabling targeted counterfactual data augmentation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble healthcare-related dialogue and clinical note datasets enriched with political and psychological trait labels (annotated via domain experts and validated questionnaires). 2. Train separate embedding models for dark traits and political bias signals. 3. Fine-tune GPT-3 or similar LLMs incorporating adversarial bias objectives. 4. Evaluate on USMLE and medical decision-making benchmarks for hallucination and bias metrics. 5. Baselines include standard fine-tuning and existing bias evaluation without psychological integration. Metrics: bias reduction rate, clinical accuracy, hallucination frequency, and fairness scores.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'A patient with symptoms suggesting multiple sclerosis but showing political hostility signs' Output: Filtered clinical advice that avoids biased conflation of psychological traits with diagnosis, producing neutral, evidence-based recommendations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If adversarial fine-tuning hinders model performance, pivot to post-hoc bias correction via output re-ranking using a dark-triad-aware classifier. Additionally, increase synthetic data diversity or incorporate human-in-the-loop validation cycles."

        "Problem_Statement": "Existing evaluation of healthcare LLMs relies heavily on traditional NLP metrics that inadequately capture the complex ethical, cognitive, and clinical validity required for safe and fair real-world applications, especially in mitigating hallucinations and subtle biases.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of lacking comprehensive, domain-sensitive benchmarking by unifying cognitive psychology paradigms, medical ethics standards, and human factors evaluation into a novel, multi-dimensional assessment framework customized for healthcare LLMs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design and implement a benchmark suite combining: (a) cognitive psychology inspired tasks targeting clinical reasoning and causal inference, (b) ethical challenge scenarios adapted from biomedical ethics codes, and (c) fairness and bias assays incorporating psychological trait-based analyses. The pipeline includes novel synthetic and real-world datasets paired with evaluative rubrics and interpretable explanation modules to assess hallucinations, bias, clinical safety, and ethical compliance holistically.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate datasets from clinical vignettes, USMLE questions, and ethics case studies. 2. Implement cognitive tasks simulating decision pathways. 3. Integrate bias testing tools incorporating psychological trait inputs. 4. Benchmark state-of-the-art healthcare LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, BioBERT). 5. Validate human subject compliance via expert panel rating. Metrics: hallucination rate, ethical violation score, reasoning accuracy, bias indices.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Task: Given a clinical ethics dilemma (e.g., patient autonomy vs. best interest conflict), the LLM is asked to reason through the correct course of action, explaining its rationale free of bias and hallucination.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If human expert evaluations show low inter-rater agreement, refine task designs for clarity or increase annotator calibration efforts. Implement automated surrogate metrics based on expert feedback to scale evaluations."

        "title": "Hybrid LLM-Crowd Psychological Annotation Pipeline for Healthcare Data Quality",
        "Problem_Statement": "Crowd-worker data sources like MTurk often suffer from data quality issues, partly due to worker psychological traits influencing annotation reliability, posing challenges for healthcare dataset annotation critical to fair and robust LLMs.",
        "Motivation": "This addresses the internal gap of overreliance on low-quality crowd annotations and the external gap of integrating psychological trait assessment of annotators, proposing a hybrid pipeline that synergizes high-accuracy LLM zero-shot annotations with selectively quality-controlled human annotations informed by psychological profiling.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an annotation system that first leverages LLM zero-shot output as candidate annotations. Subsequently, human annotators complete only critical validation steps, where they are pre-screened and continuously profiled using embedded psychological trait assessment questionnaires (including dark traits). This profiling dynamically adjusts annotator weighting and task assignment. Annotation disagreements are resolved via a task-specific confidence model combining LLM and human reliability scores.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select healthcare text corpora for annotation (e.g., clinical trial reports). 2. Recruit crowd annotators with embedded psychological trait surveys. 3. Generate base annotations using GPT-4 zero-shot. 4. Human annotators validate or correct outputs. 5. Apply confidence-weighted annotation fusion. 6. Evaluate final annotation quality vs. gold standards. Metrics: annotation accuracy, inter-annotator agreement, annotation cost-efficiency.",

        "Problem_Statement": "Biases in healthcare LLMs often stem from entangled psychological and political influences embedded in textual training data, yet methods to causally attribute and untangle these bias sources remain undeveloped, limiting effective mitigation.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient nuanced bias mitigation by combining causal mediation analysis with novel linguistic feature extraction of dark personality traits, enabling interpretable bias source separation tailored for clinical language.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a causal mediation framework that models pathways from input linguistic features (tagged for dark trait markers) through intermediate biased latent variables to LLM outputs. Use structural causal models aligned with textual embeddings to quantify mediation effects of identified psychological biases on clinical predictions. This enables targeted data augmentation or model interventions focusing on the root causal biases rather than surface correlations.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect clinical text corpora annotated for dark trait linguistic markers and political bias. 2. Define causal graphs and mediators reflecting bias mechanisms. 3. Train LLMs with mediation-informed regularization. 4. Run bias source attribution experiments comparing standard and mediation-aware models. Metrics: bias causal effect size, clinical prediction accuracy, fairness improvement.",

        "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap of limited robustness against medical reasoning perturbations by introducing a novel fine-tuning paradigm conditioning model responses on inferred psychological trait context, enabling more nuanced and stable clinical inference.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a few-shot fine-tuning approach where, alongside clinical inputs, the model receives psychological trait embeddings (e.g., inferred narcissism or agreeableness) as conditioning vectors. The model learns to modulate its reasoning pathways, reducing hallucinations and respecting psychological context. Data augmentation generates synthetic variants across psychological trait spectra to broaden robustness. This multi-modal conditioning mitigates bias propagation linked to patient or annotator traits.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Prepare clinical datasets annotated for psychological traits. 2. Generate augmented sets across trait-value perturbations. 3. Fine-tune healthcare LLMs with trait conditioning inputs. 4. Test on out-of-distribution psychological profiles. 5. Evaluate hallucination frequency, clinical accuracy, and bias reduction against non-conditioned baselines.",

This includes real-time user trust assessment modules, transparent explanation metrics grounded in psychological theory, and biomedical risk indexes assessing potential clinical harm. The framework is implemented as an interactive evaluator tool supplementing LLM deployment in medical settings.",

Integrate with LLM output explanation engines. 4. Conduct user studies with clinicians evaluating trust and decision quality supported by the toolkit. 5. Benchmark against traditional NLP validity metrics.",

These samples augment the training corpus, compelling the LLM to learn invariant, bias-resistant representations through contrastive learning objectives. This strategy crosses NLP, psychology, and adversarial training domains for novel bias mitigation.",
