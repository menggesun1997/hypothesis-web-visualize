        "title": "Graph-Neural-Augmented Data Augmentation for Environmentally Optimized NLP Training",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing data augmentation approaches for NLP models often apply augmentations uniformly across the data, disregarding the underlying semantic structure and the environmental costs of large-scale training. The core assumption that selectively augmenting only key semantic nodes identified by graph neural networks (GNNs) yields comparable or superior model performance while substantially reducing training energy consumption remains insufficiently validated. Additionally, it is unclear how reliably semantic dependency graphs combined with GNN scoring can identify the most informative augmentation targets across diverse datasets and natural language phenomena, and whether the overhead of graph construction and scoring might offset energy savings. To address these concerns, we propose a rigorous validation framework to explicitly examine the correlation between semantic node salience and augmentation utility, benchmark selective versus uniform augmentations, and incorporate concrete energy efficiency measurements during large LM training.",
        "Motivation": "While numerous NLP augmentation methods improve model robustness, they seldom consider semantic relationships within data or environmental sustainability, resulting in redundant computations and high energy costs during large language model (LLM) training. This proposal uniquely integrates graph neural networks with environmentally-aware augmentation to prioritize semantically salient nodes, targeting maximally informative perturbations that reduce training redundancy and energy consumption. By incorporating recent advances in semi-supervised learning for GNN training, GPU power profiling for precise energy measurement, and benchmarking against state-of-the-art augmentation and energy-efficient training baselines, our approach strives to fill the critical gap of combining semantic-awareness with environmental optimization. This situates our work beyond existing augmentation heuristics by systematically quantifying both model performance and energy impact, aiming for reproducible, scalable benefits relevant to LLM training at scale.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Our method consists of: (1) Constructing semantic dependency graphs from input sentences using state-of-the-art parsers to represent linguistic structure. (2) Developing a semi-supervised GNN trained with proxy signals—such as changes in model confidence or gradient sensitivity upon perturbed inputs—to score each node's augmentation impact without requiring costly ground truth labels. (3) Implementing selective augmentation focused on high-impact nodes using energy-efficient techniques like synonym substitution and back-translation limited to targeted graph nodes to avoid unnecessary transformations. (4) Integrating GPU power profiling tools (e.g., NVIDIA Nsight or proprietary power meters) into the LLM training pipeline to accurately capture energy consumption (GPU hours, wattage, and total joules) during both augmentation and training phases. (5) Benchmarking against uniform augmentation baselines and recent energy-aware training methods on diverse NLP datasets (e.g., GLUE tasks, domain-specific corpora), selected for linguistic variation and practical relevance. We will incorporate semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning approaches to further refine GNN scoring, leveraging unlabeled data for robustness. This multi-faceted design addresses prior gaps by fusing semantic graph analysis, rigorous environmental metrics, and advanced training techniques to enable sustainable NLP model improvements.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Selection: Choose NLP benchmarks with varied linguistic phenomena, such as GLUE (for semantics), SQuAD (for question answering), and domain-specific corpora (e.g., medical or social media) to test generalizability. 2) Graph Construction: Parse datasets to build semantic dependency graphs with standardized tools like spaCy and Stanford NLP. 3) Baseline Establishment: Implement uniform augmentation methods (random word substitutions, back-translation) and energy-aware baselines (gradient checkpointing, mixed precision training). 4) GNN Development: Train GNN models with semi-supervised objectives using proxy signals—track changes in validation model uncertainty or gradients due to perturbations at nodes—to produce augmentation impact scores per node. 5) Selective Augmentation Application: Apply augmentations only to top-scoring nodes guided by GNN output, employing energy-efficient transformations. 6) Energy Measurement: Instrument the training environment with GPU power profiling tools (e.g., NVIDIA Management Library, external powermeters) to collect detailed energy consumption data during parsing, augmentation, and LLM training phases. 7) Evaluation: Compare selective augmentation against baselines on model accuracy, robustness, and diverse semantics coverage alongside comprehensive energy metrics (total joules, GPU days). 8) Ablation Studies: Conduct systematic comparisons of selective vs. uniform augmentations, and assess overhead of graph construction and scoring to validate tradeoffs. 9) Integration of semi-supervised learning refinements and reinforcement learning methods to enhance GNN performance on unlabeled data. 10) Statistical analysis and visualization of trade-offs and benefits to validate hypothesis.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: 'The economic impact of the pandemic was unprecedented.' Semantic Dependency Graph identifies nodes such as 'economic' and 'pandemic' with high GNN scores for augmentation impact. Selective augmentations (e.g., synonym replacement for 'economic' -> 'financial', and paraphrasing clauses around 'pandemic') are performed, resulting in augmented data that improves model robustness with fewer samples. Energy profiling shows 20%-30% reduction in GPU joule consumption during training versus uniform augmentation baselines, validating selective approach efficacy and sustainability benefits.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If initial GNN scoring lacks sufficient precision or generalizability, we will incorporate attention-weighted heuristics from pre-trained language models (e.g., attention weights from BERT) as complementary signals to guide node selection. Additionally, if energy savings are marginal due to graph overhead, we will explore coarser graph representations (e.g., phrase-level rather than word-level) or multi-hop aggregation strategies to balance granularity and efficiency. Should supervised labels for augmentation impact prove infeasible, reinforcement learning with reward functions based on model validation improvements and energy reduction will be employed to iteratively refine augmentation selection policies. We will also consider alternate energy-saving techniques such as curriculum learning or early stopping in conjunction with our method to amplify benefits."

It is unclear whether the semantic dependency graphs and the GNN scoring can reliably capture the most informative augmentation points across diverse datasets and language phenomena. The idea implicitly assumes a strong correlation between semantic node salience and augmentation utility, which is not sufficiently supported or benchmarked against existing augmentation heuristics. Clarification and preliminary empirical or analytical evidence supporting this premise would strengthen the proposal substantially, preventing risk that the selective augmentation might omit important learning signals or fail to reduce energy in practice due to overhead from graph construction and scoring processes.  Please elaborate on this foundational assumption with references or pilot results if available, or propose validation experiments for it early in the plan (e.g., ablation studies comparing uniform vs. selective augmentation).  This is a critical soundness concern to address before further development at scale.  (Target section: Problem_Statement, Proposed_Method)  "

          "feedback_content": "The proposed stepwise experimental plan is logically structured but could be made more concrete and realistic in terms of feasibility. For example, \"Train GNNs to score augmentation impact per node\" is vague on how labeling or ground truth for 'augmentation impact' will be obtained, which is pivotal for supervised training. There is no clear description of dataset selection criteria, baseline methods for comparison, or metrics for measuring 'energy efficiency' beyond the generic 'energy metrics.' Furthermore, integrating energy measurements reliably into LLM training pipelines is nontrivial and not discussed in detail. To enhance feasibility, you should specify: (1) which datasets you plan to parse and the criteria for their selection, (2) how the GNN will be supervised or trained without clear labels (e.g., use of proxy signals, reinforcement learning, or self-supervised approaches), (3) the exact energy consumption metrics and tools (e.g., GPU power profiling), and (4) baseline augmentation and energy-efficient training methods for benchmarking. Including these details will clarify the experimental feasibility and strengthen the proposal’s practical grounding. (Target section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)"
