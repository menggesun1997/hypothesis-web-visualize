    "title": "Ethical-ESG Integrated LLM Moderation for Bias-Proof Content Evaluation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM-driven social media moderation lacks explicit integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, resulting in biased or opaque moderation decisions that neglect broader societal values.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical gap in integrating ESG metrics with AI decision frameworks for social media moderation, embedding fairness and ethics beyond productivity or technical optimization.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel multimodal LLM framework that incorporates ESG indicators as core features alongside textual input to inform moderation. The model will be trained on datasets annotated with ESG-relevant labels (e.g., sustainability, social equity), integrating custom loss functions that penalize bias and promote transparency. It will include an explainability module that articulates moderation decisions in ESG terms.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate a social media dataset with ESG-related annotations and standard moderation labels.\n2) Fine-tune a base LLM to predict moderation actions factoring ESG features.\n3) Develop an interpretable explanation generator tied to ESG metrics.\n4) Compare against baseline LLM moderation models without ESG integration.\n5) Evaluate using fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity), transparency scores, and ESG-alignment metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A tweet discussing climate change denying content.\nExpected Output: Moderation decision flagged as violating sustainability principles; explanation citing ESG conflict and text rationale.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If ESG integration confuses the LLM, fallback to modular ESG post-processing where LLM moderation decisions are re-ranked or filtered via a separate ESG evaluation model. Alternatively, increase transparency via human-in-the-loop ESG review systems."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-MECHANISM",
          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method, while innovative in integrating ESG indicators with an LLM for moderation, lacks clarity on how ESG features will be practically represented and fused with textual inputs. The mechanism for incorporating ESG annotations into the loss function to penalize bias and promote transparency needs more specific technical detail; for example, how ESG conflicts are quantified, and how the explainability module will concretely articulate decisions in ESG terms. Clarifying these aspects will improve the model’s soundness and reproducibility potential by making the approach more precise and technically grounded, reducing ambiguity in implementation steps and ensuring alignment between ESG principles and LLM outputs effectively. Consider defining specific architectures, representation forms for ESG data, and example loss formulations or explanation strategies in the paper draft to strengthen this section of the proposal. Targeting this will also help distinguish the work within the competitive space identified in novelty assessment and attract expert confidence in the approach’s feasibility and validity. This feedback targets the Proposed_Method section for refinement and elaboration to secure methodological robustness and clarity necessary for top tier research acceptance and replication by others in the field. \n\n---\n\nAdditionally, the proposed explainability module’s connection to ESG causes and effects needs elaboration to avoid generic or non-interpretable explanations that may fail the intended ethical transparency objective. Elaborated mechanisms for explainability (e.g., attribution based on ESG feature importance or counterfactual examples) would enhance soundness greatly and increase trustworthiness for real-world applications. Focus here is needed to advance beyond general claims toward explicit, testable, and interpretable explanation strategies specific to the integration of ESG principles with LLM moderation decisions, thus reinforcing the paper’s novel contribution and practical utility in this multidimensional task space.\n\n---\n\nThis critique is critical because without clearly articulated and technically sound mechanisms, the idea risks shallow impact and challenges in reproducibility or practical uptake, which are fatal flaws in premier conference settings where clarity and rigor are paramount."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a reasonable pipeline but lacks important practical considerations regarding the creation and validation of the ESG-related annotations in social media content – a key prerequisite for learning the proposed model. How will these ESG labels be defined, scaled, and reliably annotated given the subjective and nuanced nature of ESG concepts like sustainability and social equity? The plan should explicitly mention annotation protocols involving multidisciplinary experts or crowdsourcing methods with quality control, as well as possible inter-annotator agreement metrics. \n\nMoreover, the fallback plans hint at possible confusion in ESG integration but do not clarify criteria or metrics for triggering fallback use, nor incorporate redundancy testing or human-in-the-loop feedback loops prominently into the original experiment pipeline. Integrating a rigorous validation and error-analysis phase focused on the feasibility and performance of ESG integration early in the plan will help mitigate downstream risks. Adding ablation studies or pilot tests on ESG annotation quality and LLM grounding of ESG-related moderation rationale is advisable.\n\nFinally, the feasibility assessment will benefit from clearer timelines and resource estimates for curating ESG datasets, which are likely challenging to collect at scale, as well as for the development of the explanation generation component. This feedback targets the Experiment_Plan section and aims to strengthen the feasibility and practical rigor of executing this research at a premier venue standard, enhancing both scientific soundness and replicability."
