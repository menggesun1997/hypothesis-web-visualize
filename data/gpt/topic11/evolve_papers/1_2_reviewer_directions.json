    "title": "Regulatory-Driven Explainable AI Framework for Auditable Financial LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of transparency and auditability in privacy-preserving financial LLMs risks violating regulations such as GDPR and undermines stakeholder trust.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the external cross-disciplinary gap by integrating AI explainability, legal expertise, and ethical frameworks to create interpretable, auditable LLM architectures tailored for financial privacy regulations.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an explainable AI toolkit layered onto privacy-preserving LLMs that generates post-hoc interpretable summaries of model decisions with explicit links to regulatory clauses. Incorporate an auditable log system capturing provenance, data flow, and compliance checkpoints, facilitating third-party verification and real-time regulatory alignment.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select financial datasets with compliance constraints. 2) Train privacy-preserving LLMs using existing methods. 3) Integrate explainability modules generating textual and visual rationales mapped against regulatory rules. 4) Validate interpretability via expert review and compliance audits. 5) Evaluate trust metrics with stakeholder surveys.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A loan approval decision output by the LLM. Output: A layered explanation detailing the modelâ€™s reasoning, highlighting data fields used, privacy impact assessments, and alignment with applicable financial regulations, enabling auditors to verify compliance effectively.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If explainability compromises privacy, explore privacy-aware neural saliency techniques or synthetic rationale generation meeting regulatory compliance but with reduced sensitive data exposure."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while logically ordered, lacks clarity on how the compliance audits and expert reviews will be systematically conducted and measured. For instance, it should specify criteria for selecting regulatory experts, define objective metrics for interpretability validation, and describe how trust metrics will be quantitatively analyzed or benchmarked. Furthermore, scalability and reproducibility considerations for training privacy-preserving LLMs on financial datasets should be addressed to enhance practical feasibility and scientific rigor. Providing these details will strengthen confidence that the plan can concretely demonstrate effectiveness and compliance adherence rather than remain conceptual or anecdotal, ensuring the feasibility of carrying out the proposed evaluation fully and transparently in a real-world regulatory context. This is critical because privacy and compliance verification often require domain-specific rigor and well-defined experimental protocols to be credible and accepted by stakeholders and regulators alike, which should be explicitly planned and articulated here in the experimental design steps to reduce implementation risk and provide trustworthy evidence for impact claims. Targeting enhancements in this section will ground the ambitious proposal within concrete achievable milestones and evidentiary methods, improving feasibility substantially without undermining the innovation goals inherent in the idea's cross-disciplinary integration approach.

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty rating as NOV-COMPETITIVE, the proposal should integrate relevant globally-linked concepts such as 'privacy-by-design' and 'attribute-based access control' to enhance both technical depth and regulatory alignment. Specifically, the framework could incorporate attribute-based access control models directly into the privacy-preserving LLM architecture to enforce fine-grained, policy-driven data access, improving both explainability and compliance traceability. Including concepts from 'security management' and 'platform integration' may facilitate building a modular, extensible toolkit that can be seamlessly adopted in operational financial systems and audited environments. Additionally, drawing inspiration from 'legal decision-making' and 'AI integration' research could help formalize the linkage between model rationales and specific regulatory clauses, thus elevating the framework beyond a post-hoc explanation system to a proactive compliance-aware decision-support system. By adopting such global integration strategies, the research can substantially differentiate itself in a competitive field and potentially increase its impact and adoption in practical regulatory and financial technology settings.
