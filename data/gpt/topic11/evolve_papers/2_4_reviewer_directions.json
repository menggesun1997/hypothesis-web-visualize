    "title": "Integrating Linear Attention with Hierarchical Legal Ontologies for Scalable Explainable LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Efficiently producing scalable, domain-adapted explanations in legal LLMs is challenged by computational burdens of attention mechanisms and lack of incorporation of hierarchical legal ontologies for semantic grounding.",
    "Motivation": "Targets external gap of underutilized algorithmic advances like linear attention to enable efficient explanation generation, integrated with hierarchical ontologies to improve semantic fidelity and scalability in legal AI.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel legal LLM architecture replacing standard attention with linear attention mechanisms optimized for long legal text sequences and explanation contexts. Augment this with a hierarchical ontology embedding layer injecting domain knowledge to ground attention computations and generated explanations semantically. This design accelerates computation while enhancing explanation relevance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Benchmark performance of linear vs. standard attention on legal NLP tasks. 2. Implement ontology embedding integration with linear attention layers. 3. Train and evaluate on legal explanation tasks using fidelity, computational efficiency, and user trust metrics. 4. Conduct ablation studies to assess contributions of each component.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Lengthy multi-article legal contract analysis task. Output: Efficiently generated explanations highlighting relevant ontology concepts with reduced computation time compared to baseline models, preserving explanation quality.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If linear attention sacrifices explanation quality, explore hybrid attention models combining local and global attention or sparsity-aware attention optimized for legal text characteristics."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks detailed clarity on how the hierarchical legal ontology embeddings are integrated concretely within the linear attention mechanism. Specifically, the mechanism by which the ontology embedding layer \"injects domain knowledge to ground attention computations\" requires explicit architectural details or theoretical grounding. Without this, it is hard to evaluate the soundness and potential effectiveness of the design, which is critical given that linear attention approaches may limit contextual expressiveness compared to standard attention, risking explanation quality degradation if not properly addressed. Providing a clear mathematical or algorithmic formulation of this integration is essential for validating the method's soundness and differentiating it from existing works in this competitive space (NOV-COMPETITIVE). Furthermore, the explanation of how semantic fidelity is preserved or enhanced through this mechanism needs expansion to convince reviewers of its novelty and practicality in legal LLMs contexts. This should be addressed first to strengthen the core contribution's reliability and reproducibility in the community. Target: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is generally well structured but lacks explicit feasibility considerations regarding dataset availability, annotation quality, and user trust metric operationalization for the legal domain explanation tasks. For example, legal explanations require domain expertise, making the fidelity and trust evaluation challenging; the proposal should clarify how such metrics will be measured and what benchmarks or user study protocols will be employed. Additionally, the plan does not mention contingencies on computational resources required for scaling linear attention to very long legal documents. This may affect timeline and reproducibility. Strengthening the experimental methodology with explicit milestones for ontology embedding validation, legal user involvement, and a detailed fallback or hybrid mechanism evaluation scenario would improve scientific rigor and practicality. Addressing these points early ensures feasibility and smooth execution in a highly specialized domain. Target: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

For example, extending the hierarchical ontology embeddings to act as neural-symbolic reasoning modules could imbue generated explanations with interpretable, rule-based semantic structures, thus pushing beyond mere embedding enhancements. This could also facilitate explainability that aligns with symbolic legal reasoning traditions, amplifying legal domain trust and acceptance. Incorporating symbolic reasoning elements alongside linear attention may differentiate the approach, leveraging the next generation of AI insights while improving explanation fidelity and transparency. This integration would foster a hybrid neuro-symbolic architecture tailored to legal LLMs, thus increasing both novelty and practical impact. Target: Proposed_Method"
