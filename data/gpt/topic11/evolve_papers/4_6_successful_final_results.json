    "title": "Multi-Stakeholder Fairness Evaluation Framework for LLM-Driven Social Media Moderation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluation metrics overlook multiple stakeholder perspectives, risking narrow fairness assessments in LLM moderation systems.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical gap around accountability and fairness by proposing an evaluation framework that integrates views from users, moderators, regulators, and marginalized groups for holistic moderation assessment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a composite evaluation suite combining quantitative fairness metrics (e.g., equal opportunity, disparate impact) with qualitative surveys and participatory feedback collected via interactive platforms. The framework weights stakeholder priorities and generates actionable fairness diagnostics co-developed with diverse communities.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect moderation datasets and multiple stakeholder feedback.\n2) Define and operationalize multi-perspective fairness metrics.\n3) Apply framework to existing moderation models.\n4) Compare insights from single vs. multi-stakeholder evaluations.\n5) Refine models incorporating diagnostic findings for improved fairness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Moderation case involving flagged content from minority community.\nOutput: Fairness dashboard shows discrepancies and stakeholder sentiment reports guiding model adjustments.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-stakeholder feedback is sparse, simulate stakeholder preferences or prioritize marginalized group metrics initially for iterative refinement."

        "title": "Multi-Stakeholder Fairness Evaluation Framework for LLM-Driven Social Media Moderation with Regulatory and Civic Engagement Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluation metrics for LLM-driven social media moderation often overlook multiple stakeholder perspectives and fail to systematically incorporate evolving legal and governance frameworks, risking narrow fairness assessments and limited practical relevance in real-world deployment.",
        "Motivation": "In a competitive research landscape, this proposal aims to bridge a critical gap by developing an integrated fairness evaluation framework that not only incorporates diverse stakeholder perspectives—including users, moderators, regulators, and marginalized groups—but also aligns explicitly with emerging global AI governance and legal standards such as the Artificial Intelligence Act and Digital Services Act. By doing so, we intend to advance beyond purely technical fairness metrics to a multidimensional accountability tool that supports legal compliance, human rights adherence, and inclusive participatory design, ultimately enhancing adoption, trust, and impact in social media moderation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a composite framework combining quantitative fairness metrics (e.g., equal opportunity, disparate impact) with validated qualitative surveys and participatory feedback gathered through partnerships with civic engagement platforms and trusted community organizations. This approach systematically integrates stakeholder priorities weighted via a co-developed schema aligned with legal duties under AI regulations and human rights principles. The framework includes a modular validation pipeline and reproducible protocols to ensure robustness across diverse datasets and moderation models. Additionally, it features an interactive fairness dashboard contextualized with regulatory compliance indicators to guide iterative fairness diagnostics and model refinements, strengthening both scientific rigor and policy relevance.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Establish partnerships with civic engagement organizations and advocacy groups to facilitate co-design and continuous engagement with diverse stakeholders, emphasizing marginalized communities.\n2) Develop and pilot inclusive data collection instruments—including surveys and focus groups—ensuring accessibility and cultural competence to mitigate participation biases.\n3) Collect moderation datasets enriched with multi-stakeholder feedback, applying iterative sampling techniques to address participation sparsity.\n4) Define, operationalize, and validate multi-perspective fairness metrics in coordination with legal experts to ensure alignment with AI governance standards.\n5) Deploy the framework on existing large-scale moderation models to generate fairness diagnostics and legal compliance reports.\n6) Compare single versus multi-stakeholder evaluations and assess improvements in fairness, acceptance, and legal alignment.\n7) Use findings to iteratively refine both the moderation models and the evaluation framework, documenting reproducibility and robustness thoroughly for adoption at scale.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Moderation scenario involving controversial flagged content originating from a minority community with feedback collected via civic engagement platform participants and legal compliance checklist.\nOutput: An interactive fairness dashboard exhibits metric values highlighting disparities, stakeholder sentiment summaries, and regulatory alignment indicators. The system provides actionable insights specifying how model adjustments could reduce detected biases while ensuring compliance with the Artificial Intelligence Act and Digital Services Act obligations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct multi-stakeholder feedback remains sparse despite civic engagement efforts, employ a hybrid approach leveraging simulated stakeholder preference models grounded in public datasets and existing participatory research. Prioritize marginalized group fairness metrics in initial iterations and progressively incorporate broader stakeholder simulations validated through expert review to iteratively enhance framework rigor and inclusivity."

Please elaborate on concrete methods and partnerships to reliably collect diverse stakeholder input, address potential biases or sparsity in participation, and validate the qualitative and quantitative fairness metrics to ensure robustness and reproducibility of the framework's application in real moderation systems.

For instance, explicitly aligning or validating the fairness evaluation framework against emerging regulatory standards or legal duties for AI systems could increase the framework's applicability and policy relevance. Additionally, incorporating civic engagement platforms to co-develop stakeholder input processes might improve participatory design and acceptance of the framework. This integration would elevate the work beyond technical fairness assessments to a multidimensional accountability tool aligned with evolving socio-legal AI imperatives (Proposed_Method)."
