    "title": "Graph-Neural-Augmented Data Augmentation for Environmentally Optimized NLP",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current augmentation methods do not consider underlying semantic relationships in language data to minimize redundant computations during LLM training.",
    "Motivation": "Combines graph neural networks with augmentation to create environmental-aware augmented inputs that focus on maximally informative semantic perturbations, addressing the critical internal gap and expanding high-potential graph-related innovations.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct semantic dependency graphs for input sentences. Use GNNs to identify key nodes (words or phrases) whose augmentation yields maximal model learning benefit. Augment selectively on these nodes with energy-efficient transformations, thus reducing redundant data and lowering training energy consumption.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Parse datasets with dependency parsers and build graphs. 2) Train GNNs to score augmentation impact per node. 3) Implement selective energy-aware augmentation strategies. 4) Benchmark on LLM training in terms of accuracy vs. energy metrics. 5) Analyze semantic coverage and augmentation diversity.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'The economic impact of the pandemic was unprecedented.' Output: Graph highlighting 'economic' and 'pandemic' nodes prioritized for energy-efficient augmentation leading to better model robustness with minimal energy overhead.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If GNN scoring lacks precision, integrate additional attention-weighted heuristics. If energy benefits are marginal, experiment with coarser or multi-hop graph augmentations."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that selectively augmenting only key semantic nodes identified by GNNs will significantly reduce training energy consumption without compromising model performance needs more rigorous justification. It is unclear whether the semantic dependency graphs and the GNN scoring can reliably capture the most informative augmentation points across diverse datasets and language phenomena. The idea implicitly assumes a strong correlation between semantic node salience and augmentation utility, which is not sufficiently supported or benchmarked against existing augmentation heuristics. Clarification and preliminary empirical or analytical evidence supporting this premise would strengthen the proposal substantially, preventing risk that the selective augmentation might omit important learning signals or fail to reduce energy in practice due to overhead from graph construction and scoring processes.  Please elaborate on this foundational assumption with references or pilot results if available, or propose validation experiments for it early in the plan (e.g., ablation studies comparing uniform vs. selective augmentation).  This is a critical soundness concern to address before further development at scale.  (Target section: Problem_Statement, Proposed_Method)  "

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed stepwise experimental plan is logically structured but could be made more concrete and realistic in terms of feasibility. For example, \"Train GNNs to score augmentation impact per node\" is vague on how labeling or ground truth for 'augmentation impact' will be obtained, which is pivotal for supervised training. There is no clear description of dataset selection criteria, baseline methods for comparison, or metrics for measuring 'energy efficiency' beyond the generic 'energy metrics.' Furthermore, integrating energy measurements reliably into LLM training pipelines is nontrivial and not discussed in detail. To enhance feasibility, you should specify: (1) which datasets you plan to parse and the criteria for their selection, (2) how the GNN will be supervised or trained without clear labels (e.g., use of proxy signals, reinforcement learning, or self-supervised approaches), (3) the exact energy consumption metrics and tools (e.g., GPU power profiling), and (4) baseline augmentation and energy-efficient training methods for benchmarking. Including these details will clarify the experimental feasibility and strengthen the proposalâ€™s practical grounding. (Target section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)"
