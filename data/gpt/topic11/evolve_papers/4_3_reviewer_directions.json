    "title": "Cross-Domain ESG-Aware Synthetic Data Generation for Fairness in Social Media Moderation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Bias in LLM training data for moderation often reflects societal prejudices, causing unfair moderation outcomes, with limited synthetic data approaches integrating ESG fairness constraints during data generation.",
    "Motivation": "This addresses the internal gap of bias in training data affecting decision fairness by synthesizing novel ESG-aware synthetic datasets that strategically debias social media moderation training.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a generative model conditioned on ESG fairness constraints to produce balanced synthetic social media content reflecting diverse perspectives while mitigating stereotypes. Use reinforcement learning with fairness-aware rewards to generate datasets that prioritize equitable representation and ethical norms, which serve as downstream LLM training corpora for moderation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect baseline social media data annotated for demographic and ESG attributes.\n2) Train conditional generative models with fairness reward signals.\n3) Validate synthetic data quality and bias reduction metrics.\n4) Fine-tune moderation LLMs on synthetic vs. real datasets.\n5) Evaluate resulting models on fairness, accuracy, and social impact metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Request synthetic comments about immigration from varied political and cultural angles.\nOutput: Balanced dataset with no systemic bias, enabling fairer moderation performance on real immigration-related content.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If synthetic data hurts model fidelity, integrate synthetic data as augmentation combined with real data or use adversarial training to mitigate biases instead."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes conditioning a generative model on ESG fairness constraints and using reinforcement learning with fairness-aware rewards. However, the mechanism lacks clarity on how ESG constraints are quantitatively formulated, integrated into model training, and balanced against data diversity. More detailed specifications on the fairness metrics used as rewards, the generative architecture, and how the method prevents unintended distortions or loss of linguistic naturalness are needed to assess validity and reproducibility effectively. Consider providing a formalization of the fairness constraints and clearer operationalization of reinforcement learning objectives in the context of social media content generation to strengthen soundness and transparency of the approach. This will also help validate core assumptions about how bias mitigation is achieved algorithmically in synthetic data generation for moderation tasks, which remains a non-trivial challenge in fairness-aware NLP systems development (target: \"Proposed_Method\")."

In particular, the plan assumes availability of comprehensive annotations for demographic and ESG attributes on social media data, which is non-trivial due to privacy, labeling complexity, and ambiguity in ESG dimensions. Additionally, the plan needs elaboration on evaluation metrics to validate bias reduction and fairness gains, with precise definitions and baselines. The downstream evaluation should detail what social impact metrics are to be measured and how \"real\" datasets for comparison are chosen to ensure statistical rigor. Clarify fallback mechanisms and criteria for success at each phase to mitigate risks of synthetic data degrading model fidelity. Strengthening experimental planning around these aspects will enhance scientific rigor and operational feasibility (target: \"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\")."

For instance, extending the framework to simulate the effects of dataset generation on moderation strategy economics or fairness policies across digital communication platforms could position the work uniquely at the intersection of AI and media economics. Incorporating creative industry considerations or boundaries of creativity in content synthesis may also enhance novelty. Such cross-disciplinary integration leverages globally linked concepts and could elevate the research's relevance and competitiveness in premier venues (target: \"Title\" and \"Motivation\")."
