    "title": "Legal Explanation Generation via Self-Supervised Cross-Domain Transfer from Biomedical AI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Limited cross-pollination of trustworthy interpretation algorithms from biomedical AI into legal AI restricts the advancement of effective legal explanations.",
    "Motivation": "Utilizes the identified external gap by transferring and adapting cutting-edge interpretation frameworks from biomedical domain—where trust and accountability are critical—to legal LLM explainability, applying self-supervised and causal explanation techniques.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Adopt self-supervised contrastive and causal explanation models successful in biomedical AI, fine-tuned on legal datasets. Incorporate legal domain ontologies to reinterpret biomedical explanation schemas into legal reasoning constructs. This cross-domain transfer yields novel, causality-aware explanations illuminating LLM decisions in legal contexts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Review biomedical explainability methods (e.g., causal attribution, contrastive explanations). 2. Adapt methods to legal datasets with ontology integration. 3. Collect legal cases annotated with possible causal factors. 4. Evaluate legal explanation quality, trustworthiness, and user acceptability against existing methods.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Legal judgment involving cause-effect analysis of contract breach. Output: Causal explanation outlining impact paths in reasoning similar to biomedical causal explanations, adapted for legal logic and terminology.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct transfer underperforms, develop hybrid models combining rule-based causal reasoning with learned explanations or consult legal domain experts for tailored model adjustments."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposal to transfer self-supervised contrastive and causal explanation models from biomedical AI to legal AI is innovative, the mechanism for integrating legal domain ontologies to reinterpret biomedical explanation schemas lacks detailed methodological clarity. Specifically, it is unclear how the differences in domain semantics and logic between biomedical causal explanations and legal reasoning will be reconciled algorithmically. Providing concrete architectural design or formal mapping strategies for this ontology integration would strengthen the soundness of the approach and clarify how causal explanations adapted from one domain can authentically reflect legal argumentation patterns without superficial analogy only. Addressing this gap is crucial for establishing a clear, rigorous mechanism that underpins the cross-domain transferability claim and ensures explanation validity in legal contexts (Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the competitiveness of the area, the research can increase its impact and novelty by incorporating concepts from clinical decision support systems and graph-structured data from the linked concepts. For instance, using graph-structured representations of legal cases and causality as done in clinical decision support can provide richer structural explanations. Further, leveraging self-supervised learning techniques tailored for knowledge graphs could enhance model generalization across legal subdomains. This integration may also enable more interpretable, multi-modal explanations akin to healthcare's trustful AI practices, thus differentiating this work in a crowded field and expanding its usefulness beyond single-case judgments (Proposed_Method, Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)."
