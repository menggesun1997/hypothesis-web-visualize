    "title": "Hybrid LLM-Crowd Psychological Annotation Pipeline for Healthcare Data Quality",
    "Problem_Statement": "Crowd-worker data sources like MTurk often suffer from data quality issues, partly due to worker psychological traits influencing annotation reliability, posing challenges for healthcare dataset annotation critical to fair and robust LLMs.",
    "Motivation": "This addresses the internal gap of overreliance on low-quality crowd annotations and the external gap of integrating psychological trait assessment of annotators, proposing a hybrid pipeline that synergizes high-accuracy LLM zero-shot annotations with selectively quality-controlled human annotations informed by psychological profiling.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an annotation system that first leverages LLM zero-shot output as candidate annotations. Subsequently, human annotators complete only critical validation steps, where they are pre-screened and continuously profiled using embedded psychological trait assessment questionnaires (including dark traits). This profiling dynamically adjusts annotator weighting and task assignment. Annotation disagreements are resolved via a task-specific confidence model combining LLM and human reliability scores.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select healthcare text corpora for annotation (e.g., clinical trial reports). 2. Recruit crowd annotators with embedded psychological trait surveys. 3. Generate base annotations using GPT-4 zero-shot. 4. Human annotators validate or correct outputs. 5. Apply confidence-weighted annotation fusion. 6. Evaluate final annotation quality vs. gold standards. Metrics: annotation accuracy, inter-annotator agreement, annotation cost-efficiency.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical trial result snippet needing outcome classification. Output: Initial LLM classification with human validation adjusted by annotator psychological trait reliability scores.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "Should psychological profiling fail to predict annotation quality, fallback to traditional qualification tests and annotation consensus mechanisms, while exploring semi-supervised methods to enhance LLM annotation robustness."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes a hybrid annotation pipeline leveraging LLM zero-shot outputs combined with human validation weighted by psychological profiling. However, the mechanism for dynamically adjusting annotator weighting and task assignment based on psychological traits lacks clarity and rigorous justification. Specifically, how the psychological traits—especially 'dark traits'—quantitatively influence reliability scores and how these scores integrate with LLM confidence in the confidence model needs to be articulated more concretely, potentially through formulae, algorithms, or pilot analyses. Without clear operationalization, this component risks being conceptually appealing but difficult to implement robustly and reliably. Strengthening this aspect will improve the soundness and reproducibility of the method proposal, ensuring that key assumptions on psychological profiling’s predictive power are explicitly connected to annotation quality control mechanisms, and thus lowering uncertainty about the model's behavior in practice, especially in healthcare contexts, where annotation accuracy is critical and ethically sensitive.  This focus should be a priority before experimental deployment to validate feasibility assumptions further and reduce risk of negative downstream effects on data quality from misestimated annotator weights or misaligned task assignments due to noisy psychological trait measurements or questionable trait-to-performance mappings.  Including a preliminary pilot study or references to prior validated models that link traits and annotation reliability may enhance this key mechanistic claim substantially.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan provides a logical sequence from corpus selection to evaluation. However, the practicality of recruiting crowd annotators with ongoing embedded psychological trait assessment, including dark traits, needs more critical consideration. Psychological trait measurement is complex, potentially intrusive, and may result in privacy concerns or participant withdrawal, especially for sensitive 'dark trait' questionnaires. Moreover, maintaining continuous profiling to dynamically adjust weights and task assignments requires a robust infrastructure for real-time data collection and analysis that is not described. The plan also does not specify how annotator psychological trait data quality and stability will be validated over time or how potential ethical implications in profiling will be managed. In addition, evaluation metrics focus on annotation accuracy and cost-efficiency but do not explicitly include measures to evaluate the efficacy of psychological profiling in improving annotation quality. A feasible experimental plan should thus include: a pilot phase to validate psychological assessments’ predictive validity on annotation quality; ethical considerations and consent procedures; technical approaches for real-time profiling integration; and additional metrics to assess the psychological profiling component’s contribution. Clarifying these points will make the experimental plan more scientifically rigorous and practically feasible, reducing risks of rollout failure or inconclusive results in the full experiment.  \n\n"
