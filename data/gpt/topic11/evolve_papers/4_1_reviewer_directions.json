    "title": "Blockchain-Enabled Immutable Audit Trail for LLM Moderation Transparency",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current social media LLM moderation systems lack verifiable, tamper-proof audit logs, reducing accountability and user trust in moderation decisions.",
    "Motivation": "This idea leverages the external gap regarding blockchain technology to enhance transparency and accountability in AI decision pipelines, addressing the lack of auditable moderation records.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a hybrid architecture where each content moderation decision by an LLM is cryptographically hashed and recorded on a permissioned blockchain. Metadata includes timestamp, model version, input hash, and decision rationale. Smart contracts enforce immutable storage and allow third-party audits of moderation lineage without exposing private content.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement LLM moderation prototype with integrated blockchain ledger.\n2) Simulate social media moderation on real datasets.\n3) Measure overhead, latency, and storage demands.\n4) Perform security analysis of tamper resistance.\n5) Conduct user studies evaluating trust with blockchain auditability.\n6) Benchmark transparency metrics against non-blockchain baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A flagged comment for hate speech.\nOutput: Moderation verdict saved on-chain with timestamp; external auditor verifies decision consistency via blockchain explorer.\nExplanation: Hashes confirm the decision made at T1 matches audit record.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain integration proves too heavy, switch to hybrid decentralized storage solutions like IPFS with signatures or off-chain logs secured by trusted execution environments. Alternatively, explore zero-knowledge proofs to preserve privacy."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines essential steps such as implementation, simulation, and user studies but lacks detail on how scalability challenges and potential latency bottlenecks inherent to blockchain write operations will be systematically addressed or mitigated in the prototype. I recommend including concrete evaluation criteria or contingency strategies within experiments specifically targeting throughput and latency trade-offs under realistic social media moderation workloads, as well as privacy-preserving effectiveness of auditability mechanisms, to verify practical feasibility before integration at scale. This will strengthen confidence in the approach's real-world deployment viability beyond a conceptual prototype phase and data simulation environment, which is currently insufficiently detailed for full feasibility assessment in a permissioned blockchain context involving LLM outputs and smart contracts integration.\n\nFurthermore, security analysis (step 4) should incorporate adversarial models relevant to permissioned blockchains and explore resilience against collusion or insider threats, which are common in such settings but not explicitly mentioned. This addition would provide a more robust foundation for claiming tamper resistance in practice, which is crucial for the idea's trust guarantees and user confidence objectives, given the motivation centered around accountability and transparency in moderation decisions. Enhancing the experiment plan with these concrete and rigorous evaluations will significantly bolster project feasibility and practical relevance in the targeted moderation domain and blockchain ecosystem integration scenarios.\n\nIn summary, expand the experimental plan to explicitly validate scalability, latency, privacy-preservation, and adversarial robustness via measurable, realistic metrics and threat models, including fallback pathway performance comparisons, as proposed in the idea's fallback options section (e.g., IPFS or trusted execution environments). This detail is necessary to demonstrate the solution is not only conceptually sound but also pragmatically feasible under production-scale social media moderation conditions and blockchain constraints.\n\n\n"

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "To elevate the impact and originality beyond a competitive novelty baseline, the idea could integrate concepts from the 'privacy framework' and 'risks associated with AI' clusters within globally linked themes. Specifically, exploring the incorporation of privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques, such as zero-knowledge proofs or differential privacy mechanisms, into the blockchain audit trail could mitigate user privacy concerns about exposing sensitive content or personal information, thus addressing critical privacy practices. Incorporating such methods aligns with the fallback plan but positioning these privacy-oriented enhancements as central contributions rather than backups can create a more unique and compelling approach.\n\nMoreover, interfacing the blockchain-enabled audit trail with AI-driven threat detection and vulnerability monitoring systems (from 'threat detection', 'security of Internet', and 'unified security'), can expand utility beyond transparency to proactive security assurance and anomaly detection in moderation pipelines. This integration enriches the architecture into a holistic security and transparency framework valuable for broader business applications and compliance needs in sectors like social media platforms, financial, and healthcare technologies that increasingly rely on reliable AI moderation. \n\nThis direction leverages the identified global concepts to differentiate the proposal with deeper interdisciplinary innovation by tightly coupling blockchain transparency, AI accountability, privacy safeguards, and security monitoring, thus enhancing both impact breadth and novelty profile indispensable for premier conference acceptance and real-world relevance."
