    "title": "Explainable AI Pipeline Incorporating ESG Reasoning Chains for Transparent Moderation",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM-based moderation often provides opaque decisions without clear rationale linking content to fairness or ethical standards related to ESG concerns.",
    "Motivation": "This responds directly to the gap of explainability and user-controllable transparency by embedding structured ESG reasoning chains within moderation explanations.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a modular explainable AI pipeline where LLM outputs are coupled with symbolic ESG reasoning modules. Moderation decisions are justified through stepwise reasoning over ESG criteria, producing human-readable, interactive explanations that users can query or contest. The framework supports variable granularity tailored to stakeholder needs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Identify ESG concepts relevant for content moderation.\n2) Develop symbolic logic rules encoding these concepts.\n3) Integrate with LLM decision outputs.\n4) Test on curated social media datasets.\n5) Evaluate explanation coherence, user understanding, and trust metrics compared to black-box models.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Post advocating environmental harm.\nOutput: Moderation rejects post due to violation of environmental ESG norms.\nExplanation: Step 1 - Post content promotes pollution.\nStep 2 - Conflicts with corporate environmental policies.\nStep 3 - Hence, moderation enforced due to sustainability violations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If symbolic ESG integration reduces model performance, fallback to post-hoc explanation generation or saliency-based visualization techniques with ESG keyword highlights."

However, the mechanism detailing how these symbolic rules integrate dynamically with the probabilistic outputs of large language models is not sufficiently elaborated. Clarifying how conflicts between LLM inferences and symbolic logic will be resolved, the method for constructing reasoning chains, and support for varying explanation granularity is critical for assessing its soundness and effectiveness. Please provide a more precise description or schematic of the interaction between LLM outputs and ESG symbolic reasoning components, ensuring the reasoning chains are robust and interpretable, especially under conflicting inputs or ambiguous ESG criteria scenarios.\n\nThis will solidify the method's conceptual foundation and help evaluate its potential transparency benefits over current black-box moderation models.\n\nTarget: Proposed_Method"

However, key feasibility aspects warrant more detail to strengthen methodological rigor:\n\n- The process for selecting and curating datasets with ESG-relevant moderation cases requires specification, including diversity and representativeness.\n\n- The definition and operationalization of user understanding and trust metrics need concrete measures or validated instruments.\n\n- Evaluating variable explanation granularity interacting with different stakeholder groups is complex and under-explained in execution.\n\n- Consideration of evaluation baselines, statistical analysis, and potential failure modes, especially when symbolic reasoning harms moderation accuracy, is missing.\n\nDetailing these aspects will enhance the experimental plan's execution feasibility and result interpretability, ensuring informative assessment of model strengths vs fallback scenarios.\n\nTarget: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
