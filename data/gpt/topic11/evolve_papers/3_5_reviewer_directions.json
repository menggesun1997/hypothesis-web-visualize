    "title": "Real-Time AI Training Health Dashboard Leveraging Mental Health Informatic Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is no specialized, user-friendly dashboard to visualize and proactively manage the environmental and operational health of large AI training runs, hindering sustainable practice adoption.",
    "Motivation": "Translates anomaly detection and health informatics visualization paradigms from mental health to AI sustainability, answering the external gap of missing monitoring and interpretability tools for AI environmental impact during training.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a dashboard integrating deep sequential anomaly detection outputs with rich visualization modules inspired by mental health informatics. It provides intuitive indicators like Environmental Stress Index, Resource Utilization Score, and Trends. This facilitates human-in-the-loop decisions for sustainable training adjustments, enabling quick diagnosis and targeted optimization.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop anomaly detection back-end based on training telemetry. 2) Design front-end visualization inspired by mental health dashboards (e.g., mood charts, activity logs). 3) Conduct user studies with AI practitioners to refine usability. 4) Deploy dashboard in real-world training pipelines and collect feedback. 5) Measure decision impact on energy savings and user adoption rates.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Telemetry stream during a training run. Output: Dashboard UI showing anomalies in energy spikes, recommendations for parameter tuning, and historical carbon footprint trends.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If integration with live telemetry is challenging, provide batch-mode offline dashboard generation. If user adoption is low, simplify visualizations or add tutorial features to lower the barrier."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that mental health informatics visualization paradigms can be effectively translated to monitor AI training environmental impact deserves deeper justification. The domains differ substantiallyâ€”mental health dashboards focus on human psychological data with subjective and physiological inputs, while AI training telemetry is a technical, resource-driven dataset. Clarify how conceptual mappings (e.g., mood charts to environmental stress indices) will preserve meaning and utility without oversimplification or loss of critical technical nuance. Provide preliminary evidence or references supporting this cross-domain analogy to strengthen foundational soundness and avoid flawed assumptions undermining the method's relevance and interpretability for practitioners unfamiliar with mental health models.\n\nThis clarification should be added to the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections, buttressing the rationale for adapting mental health visualization approaches rather than inventing AI-specific designs from scratch or relying solely on existing anomaly dashboards in AI training contexts. Addressing this directly will also guard against skepticism regarding the suitability of proposed visual metaphors and ensure the solution is grounded in domain-appropriate design principles, fostering trust and adoption by AI practitioners familiar with diverse monitoring tools and metrics.\n\nWithout addressing this, the project risks proposing a promising but ultimately superficial or misaligned visualization paradigm that will limit impact and feasibility of meaningful human-in-the-loop sustainable training management decisions, undermining the core motivation of bridging AI sustainability and mental health informatics paradigms effectively and meaningfully.\n\nRecommendations include conducting a preliminary user study or expert review comparing interpretability and usability of mental-health-inspired dashboards versus AI-specific environmental monitoring tools to validate this cross-domain paradigm transfer before proceeding extensively with design and deployment phases.\n\nTarget sections: Problem_Statement, Proposed_Method"

Define quantitative anomaly detection performance metrics linked to environmental impact outcomes.\n- User studies: Explicitly specify the number, expertise, and diversity of AI practitioners involved; define usability metrics and qualitative assessment methods.\n- Deployment: Elaborate the nature of real-world training pipelines targeted (cloud, on-prem, scale, frameworks) and how integration challenges will be addressed technically.\n- Measurement of decision impact: Provide methodologies for linking dashboard interventions to measurable energy savings and adoption rates, including study design (controlled experiments, A/B testing) and time frames.\n\nThese enhancements will concretize feasibility, improve reproducibility, and increase confidence in the practical utility of the approach. Consider adding explicit fallback milestones and incremental validation checkpoints to manage complexity and mitigate risks, and specify tooling and platform support required.\n\nTarget section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
