    "title": "Dark-Triad-Informed Bias Filtration for Clinical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs used in healthcare harbor subtle ideological and personality-driven biases, notably political and dark personality trait influences, which impair fairness and decision accuracy in clinical contexts. There is no integrated approach to detect and mitigate these nuanced biases during LLM generation.",
    "Motivation": "This project addresses the critical external gap of integrating dark personality trait theory into bias mitigation for healthcare LLMs, innovating beyond descriptive bias evaluation methods by embedding psychological trait frameworks directly within mitigation techniques.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-stage LLM fine-tuning and inference pipeline that leverages psychological dark triad trait embedding models and political bias classifiers. During fine-tuning, the LLM is regularized using adversarial objectives derived from synthetic perturbations representing dark trait linguistic patterns. At inference, output filtering scores align with personality-based bias likelihoods, rejecting or re-ranking biased responses dynamically. The approach fuses trait theory-derived embeddings with causal mediation analysis to disentangle bias manifestation pathways, enabling targeted counterfactual data augmentation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble healthcare-related dialogue and clinical note datasets enriched with political and psychological trait labels (annotated via domain experts and validated questionnaires). 2. Train separate embedding models for dark traits and political bias signals. 3. Fine-tune GPT-3 or similar LLMs incorporating adversarial bias objectives. 4. Evaluate on USMLE and medical decision-making benchmarks for hallucination and bias metrics. 5. Baselines include standard fine-tuning and existing bias evaluation without psychological integration. Metrics: bias reduction rate, clinical accuracy, hallucination frequency, and fairness scores.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'A patient with symptoms suggesting multiple sclerosis but showing political hostility signs' Output: Filtered clinical advice that avoids biased conflation of psychological traits with diagnosis, producing neutral, evidence-based recommendations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adversarial fine-tuning hinders model performance, pivot to post-hoc bias correction via output re-ranking using a dark-triad-aware classifier. Additionally, increase synthetic data diversity or incorporate human-in-the-loop validation cycles."

        "title": "Empirically-Grounded Dark-Triad-Informed Bias Filtration for Clinical LLMs with Human-Computer Interaction Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "While clinical Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare delivery, they risk embedding subtle biases arising from psychological traits—particularly dark triad personality features—and political orientations that may inadvertently influence clinical decision-making. However, the existence and extent of such biases in clinical LLM outputs remain undercharacterized. This gap hinders effective bias mitigation and threatens fairness and safety in clinical contexts. There is a pressing need for a rigorously validated framework that empirically quantifies dark triad and political bias manifestations in clinical LLMs and systematically incorporates these insights into bias mitigation methods aligned with human-computer interaction principles, ensuring clinical usability and trustworthiness.",
        "Motivation": "Previous bias mitigation approaches in clinical LLMs largely overlook the nuanced influence of psychological personality traits and political biases, relying instead on broad or descriptive bias assessments. This research aims to establish a foundational empirical basis confirming the role and impact of dark triad traits and political biases in clinical LLM outputs through a dedicated validation phase. Building on this foundation, our novel integration of dark triad and political bias embeddings with adversarial fine-tuning techniques introduces targeted, psychologically grounded bias reduction. By incorporating human-computer interaction principles through user-in-the-loop feedback and transparent output filtering, the approach advances beyond state-of-the-art static correction, offering dynamic, clinically relevant bias filtration that enhances model accuracy, fairness, and clinician trust. This multifaceted strategy differentiates our work and addresses key novelty gaps highlighted in prior evaluations.",
        "Proposed_Method": "1. Preliminary Bias Validation: Conduct a systematic empirical study analyzing outputs of leading clinical LLMs for correlations between diagnostic/recommendation errors and input text exhibiting dark triad personality and political bias markers. Use computational linguistic analysis and clinical expert annotation to quantitatively characterize such biases' presence and impact. 2. Data and Annotation Strategy: Curate a multi-source corpus comprising clinical dialogues, case notes, and simulated scenarios, enriched with expert annotations on psychological traits using validated clinical-appropriate instruments and political bias indicators, emphasizing inter-annotator reliability. 3. Embedding Model Development: Train domain-adapted embedding models for dark triad personality traits and political bias signals, utilizing transfer learning from psychological lexicons and political discourse, validated via clustering and classification performance on labeled datasets. 4. Adversarial Fine-Tuning with HCI Integration: Implement an adversarial learning pipeline where the clinical LLM fine-tunes under dual objectives—clinical accuracy and bias minimization—guided by synthetic perturbations reflecting dark triad linguistic patterns. Incorporate real-time human-computer interaction mechanisms enabling clinicians to provide feedback on model outputs to iteratively refine bias filtration parameters, fostering transparency and clinical trust. 5. Causal Mediation and Counterfactual Augmentation: Apply causal mediation analysis to disentangle pathways through which personality and political biases influence LLM outputs, enabling targeted counterfactual data augmentation to reinforce fairness. 6. Output Filtering and Dynamic Re-ranking: Integrate a dynamic filtering module that scores generation outputs on bias likelihood, leveraging dark triad and political bias embeddings, with clinician-adjustable thresholds and UI-based explanations accessible within clinical decision support tools. This human-in-the-loop design aligns with e-business and HCI principles to improve usability and acceptance in healthcare workflows.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Step 1: Dataset Assembly (Months 1-4) - Aggregate clinical dialogue and case note datasets; engage domain experts to annotate for psychological traits and political biases using standardized instruments validated for healthcare context; assess inter-annotator agreement. Step 2: Preliminary Bias Quantification (Months 4-6) - Analyze existing clinical LLM outputs for measurable bias correlations; statistical validation of dark triad and political bias impact on prediction accuracy. Step 3: Embedding Model Training and Validation (Months 6-8) - Develop and evaluate dark triad and political bias embeddings; perform ablation studies to ascertain signal quality. Step 4: Adversarial Fine-tuning with HCI Module Development (Months 8-12) - Implement adversarial objectives embedding trait signals; design and integrate clinician feedback interface for real-time bias filtration control. Step 5: Causal Mediation Analysis & Counterfactual Data Augmentation (Months 12-14) - Identify bias pathways; generate targeted augmentation data to mitigate detected biases. Step 6: Comprehensive Evaluation (Months 14-16) - Benchmark on USMLE, clinical reasoning tasks, hallucination, and fairness metrics; conduct user studies with clinicians assessing trust and usability of output filtering interface. Step 7: Iterative Refinement and Risk Mitigation (Months 16-18) - Based on evaluation and feedback, adjust adversarial training parameters, data augmentation, and HCI components to optimize performance and clinical acceptance. Clear decision points are defined for fallback to post-hoc correction if adversarial tuning induces performance degradation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'A 45-year-old patient presents with cognitive decline and political activism history showing mistrust in institutions.' Output: The model generates an evidence-based clinical recommendation for possible early neurodegenerative process evaluation without conflating political beliefs or personality traits with diagnosis, accompanied by a transparent bias filtration score and explanation accessible to the clinician. Input: Conversation scenario where a patient exhibits subtle Machiavellian linguistic cues during clinical interviews. Output: The system's filtering mechanism flags potential bias risk, prompting re-ranking of alternative model responses to prioritize neutrality and fairness, with clinician feedback captured to enhance future outputs.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Define quantitative thresholds for clinical accuracy and bias metrics monitored throughout fine-tuning. If adversarial fine-tuning deteriorates diagnostic performance or induces instability despite parameter tuning, switch to post-hoc bias correction including: 1) Deployment of dark-triad-aware classifiers to re-rank or filter outputs in real-time, leveraging the embedding models. 2) Expansion of synthetic and counterfactual data augmentation to capture a broader range of bias manifestations. 3) Integration of augmented human-in-the-loop validation cycles where clinicians periodically review and provide corrective labels, feeding back into ongoing model refinement and output filtration thresholds, ensuring clinical relevance and safety are maintained throughout deployment."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that dark triad personality traits and political biases significantly impair clinical LLM fairness and accuracy needs clearer empirical grounding. While psychological traits influence human behavior, evidence that these traits manifest as measurable biases in clinical LLM outputs is not well substantiated in the proposal. The project should incorporate a preliminary validation phase to quantify and characterize such biases in current clinical LLMs, ensuring the theoretical basis for integrating dark triad trait embedding is sound and justified for this domain, rather than speculative or overly broad psychological theory application in clinical settings. This validation will clarify the relevance and scope of the assumed biases targeted by the method, improving the foundational soundness of the research idea in a medical context. The authors should explicitly address how dark triad traits in clinical dialogue influence diagnostic accuracy or recommendations, distinguishing real bias from confounding clinical variables to avoid pursuing an ill-defined problem space within healthcare LLM bias mitigation."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed experiment plan ambitiously combines multi-domain annotation, adversarial fine-tuning, causal mediation analysis, and evaluation on clinical benchmarks, but it lacks detailed operationalization and risk mitigation steps, putting feasibility at risk. For example, obtaining reliable, expert-annotated datasets with simultaneous political and psychological trait labels in clinical contexts is non-trivial and may cause bottlenecks or low inter-annotator agreement. Moreover, the process for training separate embedding models for dark traits and political bias signals requires clarification on modeling choices, training data, and validation. The adversarial regularization during LLM fine-tuning, especially using synthetic perturbations to represent dark trait linguistic patterns, raises questions about clarity in perturbation design, stability of adversarial training, and impact on clinical accuracy. The fallback plan is a good start but should be expanded to clearly delineate decision points and criteria for moving between fine-tuning and post-hoc correction strategies. Enhancing experimental details, timeline estimates, and potential data sourcing strategies will increase confidence in execution feasibility and scientific rigor."
