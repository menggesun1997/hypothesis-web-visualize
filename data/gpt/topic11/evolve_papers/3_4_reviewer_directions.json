    "title": "SustainAware Transformer: Integrating Carbon Footprint into Model Optimization",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current large language model optimizations optimize for loss or accuracy metrics only, lacking explicit consideration of the carbon footprint during training and inference phases.",
    "Motivation": "Bridges the internal gap by embedding carbon footprint estimations directly into model optimization objectives, pioneering sustainability-aware training protocols unseen in existing literature.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Augment transformer model training with a carbon-penalty regularizer that estimates real-time carbon emissions (using energy consumption estimates, hardware specs, and location energy mix data). The loss is modified to balance accuracy and sustainability. The optimizer dynamically schedules parameter updates and precision level (e.g., mixed-precision) to minimize emissions without degrading performance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect energy and carbon emission data from GPU clusters. 2) Train transformers with and without the carbon regularizer on GLUE benchmarks. 3) Compare downstream task performance, training energy/CO2 emissions, and convergence rates. 4) Study effects on mixed-precision and quantization schemes. 5) Run simulations across different geographical energy grid carbon intensities.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Standard GLUE dataset for classification. Output: Model checkpoints showing comparable accuracy with 15% lower estimated carbon emissions vs. baseline, detailed training logs documenting emission savings.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct integration of carbon estimators slows training, decouple carbon penalty as a periodic post-epoch adjustment. If emission estimates are inaccurate, use energy as an emission proxy for optimization."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes augmenting transformer training with a carbon-penalty regularizer that estimates real-time emissions, adjusting optimizer scheduling and precision dynamically. However, the mechanism lacks sufficient clarity on how real-time energy and carbon emission estimations are integrated into the training loop without significantly impacting training efficiency. It is also unclear how the optimizer balances accuracy and carbon emissions during parameter updates and precision changes. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed and concrete algorithmic description and potential computational overhead analysis to establish the method's core feasibility and soundness clearly before experimentation. This could involve formalizing the regularizer's formula, update schedule, and how precision adjustments are modeled within the optimization objective to mitigate risk of training instability or degraded model performance due to conflicting objectives or noisy carbon estimates in real time. Please elaborate on these aspects in the Proposed_Method section to strengthen the paper's technical foundation and soundness assessment thoroughly. This clarity is critical given the complexity and novelty of integrating sustainability constraints directly into transformer optimization loops at runtime.\n\n---\n\nTarget: Proposed_Method"

For example, collecting accurate real-time energy and carbon emission data from GPU clusters is non-trivial and may require close collaboration with infrastructure teams or specialized hardware instrumentation, which is not addressed.\n\nMoreover, the plan to run extensive simulations across different geographic energy grid carbon intensities could face practical constraints, including the availability of diverse physical clusters or the validity of simulation assumptions acting as proxies for real conditions. The plan should explicitly describe how energy data will be collected, the precision of carbon emission proxies used, and the validation steps ensuring simulation results are representative.\n\nAlso, the fallback plan's mention of decoupling the carbon penalty as periodic post-epoch adjustment should be tested as part of the experiments in addition to the main approach, to credibly compare performance and overhead tradeoffs.\n\nIn sum, please revise the experiment plan to concretely address data collection practicality, validation of carbon emission proxies, and integrate fallback method testing to improve feasibility and eventual replicability of the evaluation setup.\n\n---\n\nTarget: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
