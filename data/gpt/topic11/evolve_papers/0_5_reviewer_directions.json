    "title": "Cross-Domain Human-Centered Computing Integration for Enhanced Validity Indicators",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM validity indicators in healthcare rely heavily on standard NLP performance metrics, neglecting deeper human-centered computing insights from psychological and biomedical sciences that could elevate fairness, transparency, and clinical trustworthiness.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the external gap by bridging human-centered computing knowledge with healthcare LLM validation, enabling innovatively multidimensional, ethically grounded validity indicators beyond current limited metrics.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Forge an interdisciplinary framework combining expertise from human factors engineering, clinical psychology, and biomedical ethics to design composite validity indicators. This includes real-time user trust assessment modules, transparent explanation metrics grounded in psychological theory, and biomedical risk indexes assessing potential clinical harm. The framework is implemented as an interactive evaluator tool supplementing LLM deployment in medical settings.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Review and synthesize HCI, psychology, and bioethics measures relevant to AI system validation. 2. Develop composite validity scoring rubric. 3. Integrate with LLM output explanation engines. 4. Conduct user studies with clinicians evaluating trust and decision quality supported by the toolkit. 5. Benchmark against traditional NLP validity metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Scenario: Clinician queries LLM for diagnostic suggestions; the evaluator reports real-time bias risk scores, trust indicators, and ethical compliance alerts.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If interdisciplinary validity indicators prove unwieldy, prioritize a subset based on user feedback and progressively refine scoring heuristics with iterative clinician involvement."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks detailed operationalization of key interdisciplinary components, such as how psychological trust theories will be quantitatively measured in real time or how biomedical risk indexes will be defined and validated. Clarify the methodologies for integrating these heterogeneous validity indicators into a coherent composite scoring rubric. Additionally, the plan would benefit from specifying metrics and sample sizes for the user studies with clinicians to ensure statistical power and reproducibility. Concrete tools and algorithms for integrating the composite validity indicators with LLM explanation engines should be outlined to increase feasibility and clarity of execution. Incorporating phased milestones with fallback strategies explicitly tied to experimentation outcomes will improve scientific soundness and practical execution clarity. This is crucial to avoid ambiguity and support effective implementation of the novel interdisciplinary framework proposed. Targeting this feedback first will strengthen the proposalâ€™s technical and operational rigor substantially, enabling more confident assessment of its practical impact and downstream deployment potential. This feedback targets the Experiment_Plan section specifically and is critical for successful project progression and resource prioritization."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "To elevate novelty and potential impact beyond the current competitive baseline, the proposal should consider integrating personality and affective state profiling techniques from the Globally-Linked Concepts, such as the Big Five Personality Test or distress analysis tools like the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus-Wizard of Oz. Incorporating these elements could enrich the real-time user trust assessment modules by capturing nuanced clinician state or contextual factors influencing trust dynamics and decision quality. This integration would provide a multivariate, psychologically grounded layer to the validity indicators, enhancing ethical and human-centered dimensions and differentiating the framework within the human-centered computing and healthcare AI validation landscape. Suggest exploring multivariate analysis methods from psychology and personality research to model interactions between clinician characteristics, LLM outputs, and validity indicators. This integrated approach promises to strengthen the innovation and broader impact of the framework significantly. This feedback targets Proposed_Method and Motivation sections for enhancement."
