    "title": "Blockchain-Enabled Immutable Audit Trail for LLM Moderation Transparency",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current social media LLM moderation systems lack verifiable, tamper-proof audit logs, reducing accountability and user trust in moderation decisions.",
    "Motivation": "This idea leverages the external gap regarding blockchain technology to enhance transparency and accountability in AI decision pipelines, addressing the lack of auditable moderation records.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a hybrid architecture where each content moderation decision by an LLM is cryptographically hashed and recorded on a permissioned blockchain. Metadata includes timestamp, model version, input hash, and decision rationale. Smart contracts enforce immutable storage and allow third-party audits of moderation lineage without exposing private content.",

        "title": "Blockchain-Enabled Privacy-Preserving and AI-Augmented Immutable Audit Trail for Scalable LLM Moderation Transparency and Security",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language model (LLM) moderation systems for social media lack not only verifiable and tamper-proof audit logs but also robust privacy safeguards and resilience against insider or collusive threats. These gaps reduce accountability, user trust, and practical deployment feasibility in real-world, high-throughput environments.",
        "Motivation": "While blockchain technologies have been considered for immutable auditability in AI moderation, existing proposals often overlook critical scalability challenges, privacy concerns, and adversarial threat models inherent to permissioned blockchains. This work advances beyond conventional approaches by integrating cutting-edge privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs directly into the blockchain audit mechanism, coupled with AI-driven threat detection to proactively monitor and secure the moderation pipeline. Emphasizing these innovations addresses the competitive novelty baseline by delivering a holistic transparency, privacy, and security framework tailored for production-scale, sensitive social media moderation workflows, thereby enhancing accountability, regulatory compliance, and user trust.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid architecture combining a permissioned blockchain ledger with embedded zero-knowledge proof protocols to cryptographically commit to LLM moderation decisions without revealing sensitive content. Each moderation event is hashed and stored immutably on-chain along with metadata including timestamp, model version, decision rationale proofs, and privacy-preserving attestations. Smart contracts enforce consistent storage and enable verifiable auditability without exposing private user information. Additionally, an AI-powered threat detection module continuously analyzes audit logs and system behavior to identify anomalies indicative of insider threats or collusion. The system incorporates adaptability by allowing fallback to decentralized storage solutions (e.g., IPFS) secured via trusted execution environments for high-throughput scenarios. Together, these integrate concepts from privacy frameworks, unified security, and threat detection, creating a unique and scalable solution optimized for modern social media and sensitive domain compliance requirements.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop the blockchain-integrated LLM moderation prototype incorporating zero-knowledge proofs for privacy.\n2) Construct an AI-driven anomaly and threat detection system monitoring the moderation audit trail.\n3) Simulate real-world social media moderation workloads at scale using publicly available datasets.\n4) Measure and analyze throughput, end-to-end latency, and storage impact under varying blockchain configurations.\n5) Evaluate privacy guarantees through formal verification of zero-knowledge protocols and attempt privacy attacks.\n6) Conduct security robustness assessments incorporating adversarial models for insider threats, collusion, and data poisoning.\n7) Perform comparative analysis against fallback solutions (IPFS and trusted execution environments) measuring performance and security trade-offs.\n8) Run user studies and stakeholder interviews evaluating trust improvements and transparency perception with privacy guarantees.\n9) Document compliance benefits and practical deployment insights for social media and regulated sectors.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1:\nInput: User-submitted comment flagged for hate speech.\nProcess: LLM moderation decision computed; zero-knowledge proof generated proving moderation rationale without revealing content.\nOutput: Immutable blockchain record of moderation decision with timestamp and verified privacy-preserving proof; AI threat detection monitors audit logs for anomalies.\nVerification: External auditor confirms decision consistency and privacy compliance via blockchain explorer interfaces without accessing the original content.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: High-volume stream of user comments with various moderation outcomes.\nProcess: System manages throughput using adaptive fallback to IPFS storage with signatures during peak loads.\nOutput: Scalable audit trail with maintained privacy and transparency guarantees.\nVerification: Performance metrics demonstrate acceptable latency; threat detection flags suspicious access patterns preventing insider tampering.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain write latency or storage overhead surpass sustainable thresholds despite optimizations, the system will transition to a decentralized off-chain storage model such as IPFS combined with cryptographic signatures and trusted execution environments to secure logs. Zero-knowledge proofs remain integral for privacy preservation. In parallel, the AI threat detection module will be adapted for these fallback architectures to maintain continuous security monitoring. We will benchmark these fallback systems extensively to ensure they meet key transparency, privacy, and scalability requirements for practical deployment."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines essential steps such as implementation, simulation, and user studies but lacks detail on how scalability challenges and potential latency bottlenecks inherent to blockchain write operations will be systematically addressed or mitigated in the prototype. I recommend including concrete evaluation criteria or contingency strategies within experiments specifically targeting throughput and latency trade-offs under realistic social media moderation workloads, as well as privacy-preserving effectiveness of auditability mechanisms, to verify practical feasibility before integration at scale. This will strengthen confidence in the approach's real-world deployment viability beyond a conceptual prototype phase and data simulation environment, which is currently insufficiently detailed for full feasibility assessment in a permissioned blockchain context involving LLM outputs and smart contracts integration.\n\nFurthermore, security analysis (step 4) should incorporate adversarial models relevant to permissioned blockchains and explore resilience against collusion or insider threats, which are common in such settings but not explicitly mentioned. This addition would provide a more robust foundation for claiming tamper resistance in practice, which is crucial for the idea's trust guarantees and user confidence objectives, given the motivation centered around accountability and transparency in moderation decisions. Enhancing the experiment plan with these concrete and rigorous evaluations will significantly bolster project feasibility and practical relevance in the targeted moderation domain and blockchain ecosystem integration scenarios.\n\nIn summary, expand the experimental plan to explicitly validate scalability, latency, privacy-preservation, and adversarial robustness via measurable, realistic metrics and threat models, including fallback pathway performance comparisons, as proposed in the idea's fallback options section (e.g., IPFS or trusted execution environments). This detail is necessary to demonstrate the solution is not only conceptually sound but also pragmatically feasible under production-scale social media moderation conditions and blockchain constraints.\n\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "To elevate the impact and originality beyond a competitive novelty baseline, the idea could integrate concepts from the 'privacy framework' and 'risks associated with AI' clusters within globally linked themes. Specifically, exploring the incorporation of privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques, such as zero-knowledge proofs or differential privacy mechanisms, into the blockchain audit trail could mitigate user privacy concerns about exposing sensitive content or personal information, thus addressing critical privacy practices. Incorporating such methods aligns with the fallback plan but positioning these privacy-oriented enhancements as central contributions rather than backups can create a more unique and compelling approach.\n\nMoreover, interfacing the blockchain-enabled audit trail with AI-driven threat detection and vulnerability monitoring systems (from 'threat detection', 'security of Internet', and 'unified security'), can expand utility beyond transparency to proactive security assurance and anomaly detection in moderation pipelines. This integration enriches the architecture into a holistic security and transparency framework valuable for broader business applications and compliance needs in sectors like social media platforms, financial, and healthcare technologies that increasingly rely on reliable AI moderation. \n\nThis direction leverages the identified global concepts to differentiate the proposal with deeper interdisciplinary innovation by tightly coupling blockchain transparency, AI accountability, privacy safeguards, and security monitoring, thus enhancing both impact breadth and novelty profile indispensable for premier conference acceptance and real-world relevance."
