    "title": "GreenAugment: Energy-Aware Data Augmentation Framework for LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current data augmentation methods improve model robustness but neglect energy consumption, leading to unnecessary environmental impact during LLM training.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap of lacking integration between standard augmentation techniques and Green AI principles by innovating energy-efficient augmentation methods that maintain data fidelity and model performance while explicitly minimizing energy use.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a data augmentation pipeline that employs energy cost predictors for each augmentation operation. The framework adaptively selects and sequences augmentations to maximize informational gain per unit of energy consumed. It integrates reinforcement learning agents optimized for multi-objective trade-offs between augmentation diversity, model performance, and energy efficiency. This contrasts with prior augmentation methods by embedding a cost-awareness module and sustainability constraints directly into the augmentation strategy.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset: Use benchmark NLP datasets like WikiText-103 and OpenWebText. 2) Baselines: Compare standard augmentations (e.g., back translation, token replacement) vs. KeepAugment vs. GreenAugment. 3) Train transformer-based LLMs (e.g., GPT-2 small/medium). 4) Measure model accuracy, perplexity, energy consumption (using power meters or energy estimation tools), and carbon footprint. 5) Perform ablation studies to isolate energy savings contributions. 6) Extend experiments to few-shot fine-tuning scenarios to validate robustness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence from WikiText-103: 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.' Output: Augmented sentences generated adaptively with minimal redundant computation and a report showing 20% reduction in training energy consumption while preserving perplexity within 1% of baseline.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If reinforcement learning agent training is unstable, substitute with heuristic-based energy-cost weighted augmentation selection. If energy reduction compromises model quality, relax constraints and explore hybrid models that balance augmentation frequency with green metrics."
