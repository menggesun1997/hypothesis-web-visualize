        "title": "Blockchain-Enabled Auditable Privacy Framework with Zero-Knowledge Compliance for Financial LLM Transactions",
        "Problem_Statement": "Traceability and auditability of data and model transactions in privacy-preserving financial large language models (LLMs) remain inadequate, impairing stakeholder trust, regulatory compliance, and forensic accountability in decentralized federated learning environments.",
        "Motivation": "While prior frameworks have explored blockchain for audit trails and privacy preservation in AI systems, they often lack rigorous cryptographic mechanisms that guarantee privacy without revealing raw data and do not explicitly address adversarial threat models in federated financial contexts. Our framework innovates by integrating zero-knowledge proof techniques with permissioned blockchain ledgers, enforcing compliance via cryptographically verifiable smart contracts and attribute-based access control, thereby enabling immutable, privacy-preserving, and regulation-compliant auditability tailored to financial LLM deployments. This combination delivers stronger guarantees than competing solutions, enhancing trust, security management, and audit trail robustness in complex multi-agent federated systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a layered architecture that combines federated LLM training and inference with a permissioned blockchain-based audit trail system enhanced by zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), attribute-based encryption (ABE), and cryptographic accumulators. Transaction metadata (e.g., data provenance, participant consents, model update hashes, compliance flags) are encrypted using ABE tied to stakeholder attributes and recorded on-chain. Smart contracts embedded with formal compliance policies automatically trigger, verifying adherence via ZKPs without raw data exposure. The auditing entities query the blockchain, verifying proofs and decrypting only metadata they have rights to, ensuring privacy-preserving, tamper-proof evidence collection. To mitigate performance and scalability constraints of blockchain transactions, we implement an off-chain secure enclave ledger that batches events, generating succinct cryptographic accumulators anchoring to the on-chain ledger. We explicitly define adversarial threat models involving malicious insiders, colluding participants, and external attackers, and show our protocol resists data leakage, unauthorized access, and audit tampering under these conditions. Integration of a data governance framework ensures alignment with ethical principles, regulatory requirements, and security management best practices, enhancing the system’s real-world applicability in financial sectors.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Establish partnerships with financial institutions holding federated LLM systems and realistic datasets, ensuring access and compliance with data governance regulations. 2) Design comprehensive metadata schemas capturing provenance, consent, usage logs, compliance markers, and exploit attribute-based encryption for fine-grained access control definitions. 3) Develop the blockchain-smart contract infrastructure with embedded zero-knowledge compliance proof generators; implement the off-chain secure enclave ledger for batching and accumulator computation. 4) Simulate typical financial LLM workflows: federated training rounds, model updates, inference queries, and regulatory audits; instrument event logging. 5) Quantitatively evaluate scalability metrics—transaction throughput, latency, and storage overhead under varying federated event rates—against classical centralized logging and off-chain Merkle-tree based baselines. 6) Measure privacy leakage using empirical metrics (differential privacy parameters where applicable) and cryptographic soundness proofs. 7) Conduct structured usability studies with auditors and compliance officers: task-based evaluations, questionnaire surveys measuring usability, trust perception, and audit efficiency, and scenario-based security management exercises. 8) Perform adversarial robustness tests simulating malicious nodes and colluding parties to validate security assumptions. 9) Document resource consumption, deployment feasibility, and discuss ethical implications in line with AI ethics and financial governance frameworks.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: During a federated training epoch, a participant submits a model update. Metadata including participant ID (encrypted under ABE), update hash, timestamp, and compliance flags are recorded off-chain in the secure enclave and anchored on-chain via a cryptographic accumulator. Smart contracts verify compliance policies using zero-knowledge proofs without revealing raw update data. Auditors query the blockchain, verify proofs, and decrypt metadata they are authorized to see, confirming adherence without privacy leakage. Example 2: A sudden access request to sensitive financial inference data triggers the smart contract policy, requiring participant consent verification through ZKPs. Unauthorized access attempts fail blockchain validation and generate alerts, demonstrating enforcement robustness under adversarial threat models.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should blockchain integration introduce prohibitive overhead, we will pivot to a hybrid solution employing off-chain logging combined with advanced cryptographic accumulators and zero-knowledge proofs for auditability, balancing throughput and privacy. We will benchmark off-chain Merkle-tree based audit trails augmented with attribute-based access policies against the blockchain baseline to quantify tradeoffs and select an approach optimized for practical deployments while preserving rigorous compliance and privacy guarantees."

Currently, it is unclear how smart contracts will enforce compliance without access to raw data, and how auditors verify adherence without privacy leakage. Clarify the cryptographic techniques (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs, attribute-based encryption) enabling privacy-preserving, tamper-proof auditability, and how performance constraints of running LLM-related events on blockchain are overcome or mitigated. Providing a concrete architecture or protocol outline will strengthen soundness and reproducibility prospects well before experimental testing phases commence. This clarity is essential to validate core assumptions about privacy, auditability, and compliance enforcement within the proposed blockchain framework. This addresses the insight under the Proposed_Method section on mechanism soundness and trustworthiness of the approach itself.  \n\nFurthermore, consider explicit adversarial threat models (both malicious actors and collusion risks) to demonstrate robustness and ensure no hidden assumptions are embedded in the method's trust model. This would significantly improve rigor and confidence in the approach's soundness. \n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"

Details such as access to suitable federated LLM systems with realistic financial datasets, specifics on how metadata schemas will be designed to capture all necessary compliance markers, and metrics for evaluating privacy leakage and audit efficiency are currently vague or missing.\n\nImportantly, pilot studies should specify evaluation criteria for scalability (e.g., blockchain transaction throughput caps vs. expected LLM event frequency) and privacy leakage quantification methods (e.g., information-theoretic or empirical privacy metrics). The plan also omits how usability studies will be concretely structured for auditors and other stakeholders (e.g., tasks, questionnaires, or usage logs) to measure system effectiveness in real-world audit scenarios.\n\nAdding fallback mechanisms and measurable baseline comparisons (such as classical logging or off-chain cryptographic proofs) experimentally will provide context on tradeoffs and feasibility. Clear sequencing and feasibility timelines, as well as resource requirements (computational, data access, consortium partners), should also be articulated.\n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
