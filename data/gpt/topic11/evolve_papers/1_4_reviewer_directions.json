          "feedback_content": "The key assumption that knowledge distillation from a cryptographically trained large LLM to a smaller model will preserve both privacy guarantees and predictive performance needs stronger justification. Existing cryptographic protocols (e.g., secure multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption) are computationally intensive and may produce outputs with noise or limited throughput, which can propagate through distillation and degrade model quality or privacy. You should clarify and analyze potential challenges in maintaining rigorous privacy guarantees post-distillation and whether there are provable bounds on privacy leakage or accuracy degradation in this context. This will help establish the soundness of the core premise in your Proposed_Method section and ensure realistic expectations for privacy-accuracy trade-offs in financial LLMs under cryptographic constraints, which is a highly sensitive domain where mistakes are costly and regulations stringent. Consider including formal privacy analysis or referencing relevant theoretical work supporting this assumption in your revised plan to enhance credibility and robustness of the approach without glossing over practical limitations or risks of subtle privacy leaks through distillation outputs or adaptive attacks on the smaller model's inference stage. Addressing this assumption gap is critical to underpin the entire framework’s validity before proceeding to experimentation or deployment phases in production NLP pipelines for financial applications where trustworthiness and compliance are paramount. Without this, the proposal risks underestimating key privacy and security challenges integral to cryptographically infused knowledge distillation workflows in LLMs targeting sensitive domains like finance, thus threatening its soundness and eventual feasibility in realistic settings of data custody and regulatory audits. Detailed modeling and threat analysis will reinforce your premise substantially. The Proposed_Method section should explicitly detail this rationale and limitations to reinforce trustworthiness and transparency to reviewers and practitioners alike within the premier venue’s standards for rigor and deployment relevance in privacy-preserving NLP research contexts. This is your top-priority issue to address for methodological soundness and community confidence impacts underpinning feasibility and eventual impact potential at scale in the financial sector’s highly regulated environment where privacy preservation is non-negotiable but computational efficiency is tightly constrained by cost and latency demands for real-time decisions by end users and automated systems alike, motivating your hybrid strategy in the first place. Strong theoretical or empirical preliminary evidence on this assumption will reduce risks of failure or rejection later due to untenable privacy or accuracy claims in the distilled smaller model stage in the pipeline, the keystone enabling scalable inference with strong privacy guarantees in production settings. Ensure this reasoning is explicit and upfront in your next revision for clarity and rigor, which strongly affects feasibility and potential impact downstream, alongside experiment design modifications accordingly to stress-test such assumptions early and systematically signed off with quantitative metrics familiar to the cryptography and machine learning communities alike via rigorous privacy audits or benchmarks tailored to LLMs under encryption and distillation constraints currently under active research in these intersecting fields and communities, well-aligned with premier conference evaluation expectations for novelty and conceptual soundness including rigorous baselines for accuracy-privacy trade-off frontiers in financial NLP applications where trust is paramount and regulatory scrutiny intense, mitigating adoption risk and maximizing societal and financial industry impact feasibly and responsibly with state-of-the-art cryptographic and AI advances combined pragmatically yet rigorously analyzed at a conceptual and experimental level fully integrated and transparently disclosed in the final submission to clarify innovation beyond incremental combination of known techniques and to highlight progress beyond competitive baselines in this hot research nexus with intense competition and evolving standards. Also, communicate limitations explicitly to avoid overselling disruptive claims prematurely that might later pose reputational and usability risks prematurely in the literature or industry, especially in premier conference contexts emphasizing soundness and rigor above hype or unproven assumptions. This improvement is fundamental for reviewers to trust the proposed hybrid approach’s core viability and will elevate this promising but challenging research idea substantially for acceptance and eventual real-world adoption in sensitive financial NLP settings where privacy and latency matter equally at scale, driving innovation forward responsibly and impactfully in this rapidly evolving interdisciplinary frontier of cryptography, knowledge distillation, and large language models combined in applied financial AI systems with strict regulatory and operational constraints intact as the primary domain context and driver for your work’s relevance, feasibility, and impact potential at scale in principle and practice at a premier venue’s standards for transformative contributions with strong empirical and theoretical underpinning and transparent limitations discussion reflecting mature and conscientious research execution plans as mandated by these highly competitive and impactful research domains with intense attention to privacy, scalability, and regulatory compliance at the application level by domain experts and AI research community alike at the conference target audience level in the prompt’s context. In summary, your top priority fix is to rigorously validate or explicitly bound privacy-accuracy tradeoffs inherent in cryptographic LLM training plus knowledge distillation under practical constraints to substantiate core methodology assumptions in Proposed_Method, critically bolstering soundness and feasibility claims and thereby potential impact and competitive differentiation in this crowded but consequential research space central to scalable privacy-preserving LLM deployments in finance and beyond at scale under stringent real-world constraints and requirements alongside detailed experiment design reflections to stress-test and document these fundamental assumptions early and systematically for robust benchmarking and trust-building within premier AI research community standards, aiming for your strongest possible foundational contribution with clear scope and rigorous conceptual and empirical validation beyond mere combination of known primitives alone, positioning your work as a definitive step forward rather than another incremental tweak, hence lifting novelty from competitive to compelling for reviewers and end users alike in this critical domain where privacy and efficiency demands meet large model capabilities for automated, privacy-aware financial decision-making and compliance verification in the wild, a high-need, high-impact frontier ripe for principled, rigorously analyzed innovation and benchmark-setting contributions ready for premier conference acceptance and subsequent strong scientific and industrial impact pathways starting from sound and reliable premise grounds you must establish early on point-by-point in next revision iteration to cement scientific and practical value and trust preconditions underlying all subsequent claims of feasibility, novelty, and impact crucial for high-tier acceptance and influence at this seminal research junction, no shortcuts allowed in this necessarily subtle and delicate interplay of cryptographic protocols plus AI-driven model compression paradigms targeting sensitive application domains, underpinning your entire framework’s credibility and success potential career-wise, community-wise, and industry-wise thereby, the most critical step to take now beyond other improvements to make your proposal truly competitive and impactful at the conference venue level and beyond ultimately in real-world deployments and scientific discourse alike, thus highest priority critique from an expert area chair standpoint focusing on soundness primarily to enable all further value creation thereafter effectively and credibly at scale under top-tier conference scrutiny and real-world constraints simultaneously, respecting the problem statement’s practical relevance while pushing rigor and clarity forward substantially beyond marginal baseline heuristics or demonstrations in the initial text provided in your prompt briefing, consistently adhering to best practices and community expectations for privacy-preserving LLM research with rigorous quantitative and theoretical foundations mandatory in this fast-moving, sensitive, and highly-demanding research space to earn acceptance and influence in premier venues and domains globally, notably in the challenging intersection between cryptographic AI training and privacy-aware model distillation under computational and regulatory constraints inherent to financial NLP workflows your work targets and aims to enable feasibly and impactfully in real-world settings within strict privacy and compliance frameworks effectively and reliably as envisioned. Thank you for addressing this pivotal concern first and foremost thoroughly for all downstream benefits to crystallize your important research contribution credibly and fully in this space at premier venue level with far-reaching societal and industrial impact potential accordingly intrinsic to your research objectives and ultimate deployment targets stated herein in your initial plan, awaiting fully detailed clarification and validation plus risk analysis and appropriate experiment modifications fulfilling these requirements promptly in your next submitted proposal draft iteration for the highest possible review scores and impact realization potential in context. Please revise explicitly. Thank you again! (Target section: Proposed_Method)"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks sufficient detail regarding the challenges associated with training large LLMs under cryptographic constraints and the subsequent knowledge distillation process. Cryptographic training methods like secure multiparty computation or homomorphic encryption are computationally expensive and may limit the size of training batches, learning rates, or iteration counts, which could impact convergence and final model quality. Your plan should include resource estimates, anticipated computational overheads, and practical strategies to mitigate these issues (e.g., approximation methods, batching schemes, hybrid encryption). Additionally, the plan should specify concrete quantitative metrics and baselines for privacy (e.g., differential privacy budgets or cryptographic security parameters), accuracy (e.g., task-specific benchmarks), and latency (e.g., end-to-end inference times on representative hardware) to enable rigorous evaluation and comparison. Furthermore, the interpretability and regulatory compliance tests should be operationalized with clearly defined evaluation criteria and relevant regulatory frameworks cited, such as GDPR or financial industry standards. Without such specifics, it is unclear how the experiments will validate the feasibility claims or demonstrate that the distilled model meets the stringent requirements needed for deployment in the financial domain. Strengthen your experimental plan by incorporating these practical details to demonstrate that your approach can be realistically implemented, properly evaluated, and iterated upon. This enhancement is critical to convince reviewers that your research is not only conceptually promising but also executable and relevant under real-world constraints highly prevalent in privacy-critical financial AI applications. This will increase confidence in your methodology’s feasibility and hence its potential impact. Address this issue promptly before advancing further development stages or submission.
