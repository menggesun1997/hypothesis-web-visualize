    "title": "Ethical-ESG Integrated LLM Moderation for Bias-Proof Content Evaluation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM-driven social media moderation lacks explicit integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, resulting in biased or opaque moderation decisions that neglect broader societal values.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical gap in integrating ESG metrics with AI decision frameworks for social media moderation, embedding fairness and ethics beyond productivity or technical optimization.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel multimodal LLM framework that incorporates ESG indicators as core features alongside textual input to inform moderation. The model will be trained on datasets annotated with ESG-relevant labels (e.g., sustainability, social equity), integrating custom loss functions that penalize bias and promote transparency. It will include an explainability module that articulates moderation decisions in ESG terms.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate a social media dataset with ESG-related annotations and standard moderation labels.\n2) Fine-tune a base LLM to predict moderation actions factoring ESG features.\n3) Develop an interpretable explanation generator tied to ESG metrics.\n4) Compare against baseline LLM moderation models without ESG integration.\n5) Evaluate using fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity), transparency scores, and ESG-alignment metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A tweet discussing climate change denying content.\nExpected Output: Moderation decision flagged as violating sustainability principles; explanation citing ESG conflict and text rationale.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If ESG integration confuses the LLM, fallback to modular ESG post-processing where LLM moderation decisions are re-ranked or filtered via a separate ESG evaluation model. Alternatively, increase transparency via human-in-the-loop ESG review systems."

        "title": "Explicit ESG-Driven Multimodal LLM Moderation Framework with Transparent Attribution and Robust Annotation Protocols",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM-based social media moderation systems inadequately integrate explicit Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, leading to biased, opaque content evaluations that fail to align with evolving societal and ethical standards. This gap restricts the ethical landscape impact and limits trustworthiness and transparency in automated moderation.",
        "Motivation": "Despite advances in natural language processing and ethical AI, integrating ESG metrics within LLM moderation remains underexplored and methodologically shallow, limiting practical adoption and reproducibility. Addressing this, our approach provides a rigorously defined, technically grounded ESG integration mechanism with detailed fusion strategies, loss formulations, and explainability paradigms. By embedding governance practices and a human rights-based approach directly into the LLM training pipeline, we produce a next-generation moderation system aligned with corporate finance and the ethical landscape in social media governance, surpassing prior work by operationalizing complex ESG concepts into transparent, actionable model contributions.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a structured multimodal architecture combining textual embeddings from a transformer-based LLM with explicitly encoded ESG embeddings derived from curated indicator vectors. ESG features represent standardized quantitative and categorical metrics (e.g., sustainability scores, social equity indices, governance compliance markers) encoded via learned embeddings trained jointly with text inputs. Fusion occurs via a cross-modal attention layer integrating ESG and linguistic signals before final moderation prediction.\n\nTo quantify ESG conflicts, we design a composite ESG conflict score computed as a weighted sum of deviations from ideal ESG target distributions, derived from domain expert-defined thresholds and continuously refined via reinforcement feedback. This scalar score is integrated into a custom composite loss function: \n\nLoss = CrossEntropyLoss + λ1 * BiasPenalty(ESG_conflict_score) + λ2 * TransparencyRegularizer,\n\nwhere BiasPenalty increases with detected demographic or ESG group disparities, and TransparencyRegularizer encourages sparsity and model explanation coherence.\n\nThe explainability module leverages ESG-importance attribution through integrated gradients on ESG embeddings and text tokens, producing score heatmaps highlighting ESG principle impacts on moderation decisions. Additionally, counterfactual explanation generation synthesizes minimally altered inputs that flip ESG conflict signals, providing interpretable examples of ESG boundary cases. This hybrid explanation strategy results in transparent, human-interpretable justifications explicitly aligned with ESG causes and effects, supporting governance and ethical auditing.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) ESG Annotation Protocol Design: Collaborate with interdisciplinary experts in sustainability, social sciences, and governance to define scalable annotation schemas with detailed guidelines capturing complexities of ESG concepts in social media content.\n2) Data Annotation: Use a hybrid crowdsourcing and expert annotation process with built-in quality control measures including inter-annotator agreement (Cohen’s kappa > 0.8) and iterative annotation refinement cycles.\n3) Dataset Curation: Compile a diverse multilingual social media corpus annotated with both standard moderation labels and ESG-related metadata (sustainability violations, social equity issues, governance risks).\n4) Model Development: Implement the proposed multimodal fusion LLM architecture with ESG embedding modules and custom loss functions, tuning λ parameters based on pilot experiments.\n5) Explainability Module Integration: Design and integrate ESG attribution and counterfactual explanation algorithms; validate explanation fidelity via user studies with domain experts and lay users assessing clarity and trustworthiness.\n6) Baselines and Ablations: Compare with state-of-the-art LLM moderation models without ESG features, and conduct ablation testing on ESG feature sets, encoding strategies, and loss components.\n7) Human-in-the-loop Feedback Loop: Incorporate continuous expert feedback cycles to refine ESG annotations, explanation quality, and fallback decision triggers.\n8) Feasibility & Resource Assessment: Provide detailed timelines and resource allocations for ESG dataset construction (estimated 6 months), model training and evaluation phases, and explanation system deployment.\n9) Fallback Criteria Definition: Establish quantitative ESG alignment thresholds and confidence metrics that trigger fallback modular ESG post-processing or human review, integrated early into the pipeline for robustness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input 1: Tweet denying climate change impact with dismissive language.\nExpected Output 1: Moderation Decision = Flagged for sustainability violation; Explanation details highlight ESG conflict score driven by environmental sustainability metrics and social responsibility principles, plus counterfactual example showing minimal text revisions that would reduce ESG violation.\n\nInput 2: Post discussing equitable workplace practices positively.\nExpected Output 2: Moderation Decision = Approved; Explanation emphasizes positive alignment with social equity ESG indicators via attribution heatmaps demonstrating responsible governance practice adherence.\n\nInput 3: Content with ambiguous phrasing but potential governance risk.\nExpected Output 3: Moderation Decision = Requires human review; Explanation reports moderate ESG conflict score with transparency metrics and flags uncertainty, triggering fallback human-in-the-loop step.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should ESG feature integration introduce ambiguity or degrade predictive performance (assessed by ESG conflict calibration and moderation accuracy metrics), adopt an explicit two-stage fallback approach:\n\n1) ESG Post-processing Layer: Apply a separate, modular classifier specifically trained to evaluate ESG alignment on LLM moderation outputs, enabling re-ranking or filtering before final decisions.\n\n2) Human-in-the-Loop ESG Review System: Develop interfaces for expert reviewers to verify borderline cases flagged by fallback criteria grounded in quantitative ESG thresholds and explanation confidence scores.\n\nThese fallback mechanisms are integrated early into experiments with triggers defined by ablation study outcomes and ESG alignment score distributions to ensure reproducibility, practical feasibility, and ethical safeguards."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method, while innovative in integrating ESG indicators with an LLM for moderation, lacks clarity on how ESG features will be practically represented and fused with textual inputs. The mechanism for incorporating ESG annotations into the loss function to penalize bias and promote transparency needs more specific technical detail; for example, how ESG conflicts are quantified, and how the explainability module will concretely articulate decisions in ESG terms. Clarifying these aspects will improve the model’s soundness and reproducibility potential by making the approach more precise and technically grounded, reducing ambiguity in implementation steps and ensuring alignment between ESG principles and LLM outputs effectively. Consider defining specific architectures, representation forms for ESG data, and example loss formulations or explanation strategies in the paper draft to strengthen this section of the proposal. Targeting this will also help distinguish the work within the competitive space identified in novelty assessment and attract expert confidence in the approach’s feasibility and validity. This feedback targets the Proposed_Method section for refinement and elaboration to secure methodological robustness and clarity necessary for top tier research acceptance and replication by others in the field. \n\n---\n\nAdditionally, the proposed explainability module’s connection to ESG causes and effects needs elaboration to avoid generic or non-interpretable explanations that may fail the intended ethical transparency objective. Elaborated mechanisms for explainability (e.g., attribution based on ESG feature importance or counterfactual examples) would enhance soundness greatly and increase trustworthiness for real-world applications. Focus here is needed to advance beyond general claims toward explicit, testable, and interpretable explanation strategies specific to the integration of ESG principles with LLM moderation decisions, thus reinforcing the paper’s novel contribution and practical utility in this multidimensional task space.\n\n---\n\nThis critique is critical because without clearly articulated and technically sound mechanisms, the idea risks shallow impact and challenges in reproducibility or practical uptake, which are fatal flaws in premier conference settings where clarity and rigor are paramount."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a reasonable pipeline but lacks important practical considerations regarding the creation and validation of the ESG-related annotations in social media content – a key prerequisite for learning the proposed model. How will these ESG labels be defined, scaled, and reliably annotated given the subjective and nuanced nature of ESG concepts like sustainability and social equity? The plan should explicitly mention annotation protocols involving multidisciplinary experts or crowdsourcing methods with quality control, as well as possible inter-annotator agreement metrics. \n\nMoreover, the fallback plans hint at possible confusion in ESG integration but do not clarify criteria or metrics for triggering fallback use, nor incorporate redundancy testing or human-in-the-loop feedback loops prominently into the original experiment pipeline. Integrating a rigorous validation and error-analysis phase focused on the feasibility and performance of ESG integration early in the plan will help mitigate downstream risks. Adding ablation studies or pilot tests on ESG annotation quality and LLM grounding of ESG-related moderation rationale is advisable.\n\nFinally, the feasibility assessment will benefit from clearer timelines and resource estimates for curating ESG datasets, which are likely challenging to collect at scale, as well as for the development of the explanation generation component. This feedback targets the Experiment_Plan section and aims to strengthen the feasibility and practical rigor of executing this research at a premier venue standard, enhancing both scientific soundness and replicability."
