    "title": "Anomaly-Green: Real-Time Energy Anomaly Detection in AI Training Pipelines",
    "Problem_Statement": "Large-scale model training lacks real-time monitoring tools to detect inefficiencies or abnormal energy usage, limiting timely interventions to reduce environmental impact.",
    "Motivation": "Leverages cross-disciplinary insights from mental health informatics, specifically anomaly detection in sequential data, to create adaptive green monitoring that is currently missing, directly addressing the external gap in sustainable AI operational tools.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a deep sequential anomaly detection system trained on historical AI training metrics (e.g., GPU power usage, temperature, utilization, progress logs). The model uses LSTM-based variational autoencoders to identify deviations indicative of inefficient resource usage or unexpected spikes in carbon footprint. This system triggers adaptive alerts and suggests dynamic adjustments (e.g., dynamic batch sizing, learning rate changes) to optimize energy efficiency during training in real time.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets from large-scale AI training jobs with detailed telemetry logs. 2) Train the anomaly detection model on normal operational data. 3) Simulate anomalies by injecting energy spikes or hardware faults. 4) Evaluate detection accuracy, false positive rate, and response latency. 5) Integrate with training schedulers to implement corrective policies and measure environmental metrics pre- and post-integration.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Real-time telemetry stream showing unusual GPU power surge during training. Output: Detection alert indicating anomaly at timestep t with suggested corrective actions and estimated energy saving impact.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If LSTM-based models overfit or underperform, try Transformer-based temporal anomaly models. If real-time detection latency is high, implement lightweight threshold-based heuristics combined with periodic deep model checks."
