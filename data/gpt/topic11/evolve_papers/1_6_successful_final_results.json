        "title": "Multi-Modal Privacy-Ensuring Financial LLMs Combining Text and Structured Data with Federated Alignment and Auditable Privacy Guarantees",
        "Problem_Statement": "Financial data encompasses heterogeneous modalities such as free-text reports, structured time series, and tabular data, which pose substantial challenges to designing privacy-preserving large language models (LLMs). Existing privacy-focused LLMs primarily target text, and struggle to securely and coherently fuse multimodal financial data across federated institutional silos while ensuring privacy compliance and data utility balance.",
        "Motivation": "While multi-modal and privacy-preserving AI have each witnessed considerable progress, their intersection in privacy-conscious federated learning for financial domains remains underexplored. Our approach pioneers an advanced architecture that not only integrates multimodal heterogeneous financial inputs (including analyst free-text reports and structured market data) under unified privacy-preserving mechanisms but also embeds rigorous, quantifiable cross-modal alignment strategies. Leveraging federated learning innovations alongside techniques inspired by vision-language models and natural language processing, we address modality-specific noise injection challenges within differential privacy, ensuring superior fusion fidelity and compliance auditing. This enables secure, high-utility intelligent decision-making in financial contexts at scale, surpassing current competitive baselines.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel federated multi-modal LLM framework combining transformer-based language encoders for free-text financial reports with modality-tailored encoders for structured time-series and tabular data. \n\nKey innovations include: \n1) **Modality-specific encrypted embeddings:** Each modality preprocesses data with dedicated encryption protocols (e.g., secure multi-party computation for tabular, homomorphic encryption-enhanced embeddings for text) integrated into the input pipeline.\n2) **Unified privacy-preserving fusion layer:** We design an architectural fusion layer that aligns cross-modal latent spaces through a multi-headed attention mechanism constrained by modality-differential privacy budgets. This is augmented with a noise-calibrated cross-modal contrastive loss to preserve semantic coherence despite perturbations.\n3) **Federated gradient aggregation with noise-adaptive optimizers:** We introduce a federated optimizer that adaptively balances noise injection for privacy across modalities to prevent gradient signal degradation, ensuring stable convergence.\n4) **Cross-modal coherence quantification:** We operationalize coherence metrics (e.g., mutual information estimation and cross-attention fidelity scores) measured under privacy constraints to guide training and validate alignment quality.\n5) **Automated privacy compliance auditing:** Inspired by formal verification frameworks, we develop automated auditing tools that scan model outputs over combined modalities to detect possible leakage risks and ensure adherence to regulatory data protection standards.\n\nThis design draws inspiration from vision-language model fusion techniques while adapting modality-specific privacy mechanisms. Our detailed architectural diagrams—including encryption interfaces, fusion modules, and auditing pipelines—are provided to concretely demonstrate signal flow and privacy interactions at scale.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) **Data Acquisition and Standardization:** Partner with financial institutions to collect paired multi-modal datasets (e.g., anonymized free-text analyst reports and corresponding structured market data) under strict privacy agreements. Develop data harmonization pipelines adhering to regulatory standards with synthetic data augmentation to simulate diverse institutional data distributions.\n\n2) **Modality-Specific Privacy Layer Validation:** Independently implement and benchmark encrypted embedding modules per modality using pilot datasets to quantify overhead, noise impact, and utility preservation.\n\n3) **Pilot Federated Multi-Modal Training:** Conduct federated training trials across simulated institutional nodes, using our noise-adaptive federated optimizer to monitor convergence, privacy budget consumption, and cross-modal coherence metrics.\n\n4) **Full-Scale Federated Training and Benchmarking:** Scale experiments using real institutional data with varying privacy budgets. Compare multi-modal model utility and privacy leakage against strong single-modal and conventional multimodal baselines.\n\n5) **Automated Regulatory Compliance Auditing:** Deploy formalized auditing tools to assess output leakage risks and cross-modal data protection alignment, refining model and privacy parameters iteratively.\n\n6) **Robustness and Failure Mode Analysis:** Evaluate resilience to heterogenous data noise, modality failure, and encryption faults. Implement fallback strategies such as hybrid late-fusion ensembles with privacy-respecting output aggregation when fusion fidelity degrades.\n\n7) **Documentation and Deployment Guidelines:** Formalize best practices, compliance protocols, and operational guidelines, demonstrating the model’s real-world feasibility in regulated financial settings.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An anonymized customer complaint text describing fraudulent activity, paired with their encrypted transaction history time-series and tabular account metadata.\n\nOutput: A contextually accurate, privacy-compliant advisory response that suggests remedial measures without revealing any sensitive financial details or raw transaction data. The response maintains semantic alignment across modalities, e.g., referencing transaction patterns implicitly inferred but never explicitly disclosed.\n\nAdditional Test Cases:\n- Cross-institutional market analysis summaries respecting institutional data silos.\n- Encrypted multi-modal risk assessment reports generated without compromising proprietary structured datasets.\n\nAll outputs are audited to ensure no differential privacy budget violations or inadvertent data leakage occur.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should the integrated encrypted fusion layer introduce prohibitive noise degrading multimodal representation quality or hinder federated convergence, we will pivot to advanced hybrid architectures combining:\n\n- **Hybrid late-fusion ensembles:** Modalities are processed and privacy-protected independently; outputs are then aggregated under differential privacy guarantees via secure aggregation protocols.\n\n- **Modality-specific transformers with cross-modal attention gating:** Enabling flexible interaction only where strong signal coherence exists, reducing privacy noise over shared layers.\n\nWe will also explore cross-modal data augmentation and contrastive learning to enhance representation robustness under privacy constraints. In parallel, simulated and synthetic dataset experiments will help tune privacy-utility trade-offs before reattempting integrated fusion. Automated privacy auditing remains central throughout, ensuring fallback methods meet regulatory and security requirements."

Specifically, how the model maintains alignment or fusion fidelity under differential privacy and encryption in federated multi-modal contexts is under-specified, risking issues with joint representation learning and gradient aggregation. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed theoretical or architectural diagram showing how modalities are fused securely without losing critical signal or incurring prohibitive noise from privacy mechanisms, including fallback technical specifics beyond the high-level late-fusion concept presented. Clarify how cross-modal coherence will be quantitatively ensured under these constraints to solidify the soundness of the core approach in handling heterogenous financial data streams securely and effectively at scale.  This is essential given the complexity and privacy sensitivity in financial domains, making this a top-priority to target for robustness and clarity before proceeding to experiments or deployment scenarios.

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan is comprehensive but lacks critical operational details that could undermine its feasibility. For example, collecting paired multi-modal financial datasets (text and structured data) that are institutionally federated yet privacy compliant is non-trivial, with little discussion on data acquisition challenges, standardization, and regulatory constraints. Additionally, modality-specific privacy layers and federated training might introduce significant overhead and convergence issues that are not addressed. The plan should incorporate concrete strategies for dataset harmonization, simulation or pilot studies to validate privacy-enabling layers independently before full multi-modal federated training, and detailed fallback or contingency protocols beyond a generic late-fusion approach. Also, the methods for auditing regulatory compliance across modalities need clearer operationalization, potentially involving automated tools or formal verification frameworks to assess nuanced data leakage risks. Improving these experiment design facets is critical before solidifying the viability of the approach in real-world noisy, regulated financial settings. (Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)"
