    "Problem_Statement": "Current explainability frameworks lack adaptation for multilingual legal corpora and diverse jurisdictional ontologies, limiting deployment across global legal systems.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses critical gaps in domain-specific customization by developing hierarchical explainability frameworks integrating multiple jurisdictional legal ontologies and adapted minimal supervision strategies, enabling semantically consistent explanations across languages and regions.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a multilingual legal LLM that integrates hierarchical ontologies from various jurisdictions, embedding cross-lingual mappings and legal taxonomy alignments.

        "title": "Human-Centered Multilingual Hierarchical Explainability Framework with Interactive Conversational AI for Cross-Jurisdictional Legal LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing explainability frameworks for legal LLMs inadequately address the combined challenges of multilingual legal corpora, cross-jurisdictional ontology heterogeneity, and the diverse cognitive and cultural needs of end users, restricting their practical deployment and trustworthiness in global legal contexts.",
        "Motivation": "To overcome critical limitations in current domain-specific explainability methods, this research proposes a novel human-centered, multilingual hierarchical explainability framework that integrates multiple jurisdictional legal ontologies with interactive conversational AI. By embedding principles from human-centered artificial intelligence, requirements engineering, and business process management, the framework aims to generate semantically consistent, culturally relevant, and cognitively meaningful explanations tailored to diverse user groups (e.g., lawyers, judges, citizens). This approach differentiates itself by combining multilingual legal ontology alignment with interactive dialogue-based explanations, thereby enhancing user trust, legal interpretability, and practical adoption across global jurisdictions.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose constructing a multilingual legal LLM integrated with hierarchical ontologies spanning various jurisdictions. Cross-lingual ontology alignment will be performed using advanced embedding projection techniques such as VecMap and MUSE, augmented by supervised fine-tuning with minimal expert input. To ensure cognitive relevance and cultural alignment, the explanation framework will incorporate human-centered AI design principles, producing explanations tailored to distinct user personas. Further, conversational AI modules will be developed to provide interactive, context-aware explanations, facilitating real-time clarification and user feedback loops. Integration with requirements engineering and business process management methodologies will enable mapping of legal explanations onto enterprise risk and compliance workflows, broadening applicability. The system will include adaptive instance-based learning to mitigate data scarcity in less-resourced jurisdictions, leveraging synthetic dataset generation and crowd-based expert curation for supervision.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Collection: Aggregate multilingual legal corpora and jurisdiction-specific ontologies, covering both well-resourced and lower-resourced regions. 2. Ontology Alignment: Apply embedding projection techniques (e.g., VecMap, MUSE) combined with minimal supervised signals for cross-lingual and cross-jurisdictional alignment. Alignment quality will be quantitatively assessed using precision, recall, and F1 scores on known ontology mappings and structural congruence metrics. 3. Model Training: Train multilingual LLMs augmented with ontology embeddings to enable hierarchical semantic representation. 4. Explanation Framework Development: Design explanation generators emphasizing human-centered AI principles. 5. Conversational AI Integration: Develop dialogue systems enabling interactive, user-tailored explanations. 6. Evaluation Protocols: Deploy comprehensive evaluation with multilingual legal experts and diverse user groups including lawyers, judges, and lay citizens. Semantic fidelity will be measured via information gain and explanation accuracy metrics; inter-annotator agreement will be quantified using Cohen's kappa and Krippendorff's alpha statistics; cultural and jurisdictional nuances will be systematically captured through structured questionnaires and scenario-based assessments. 7. Risk Mitigation and Fallback: For jurisdictions with limited data or expertise, utilize synthetic data generation and crowd-based requirements engineering methods for supervision; if embedding alignment proves insufficient, fallback to manual curation combined with unsupervised alignment techniques; iteratively refine based on expert feedback. 8. Business Process Integration: Map explanation outputs to enterprise risk and compliance workflows via process mining and business process engineering methods to validate real-world applicability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A complex labor law clause in the Spanish jurisdiction containing temporally-bound conditions. Output: A hierarchical explanation aligned with the Spanish labor ontology, cross-referenced with the EU labor law ontology, provided as an interactive dialogue that adapts explanations based on user role (e.g., detailed for lawyers, simplified for citizens). The system highlights corresponding compliance processes within an enterprise risk management framework, allowing user queries for further clarifications or legal precedent analogies.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should multilingual ontology alignment face significant barriers, initiate with a bilingual framework focusing on major jurisdiction pairs, using extensive manual curation aided by expert crowdsourcing and synthetic data augmentation techniques. If expert supervision is scarce, progressively incorporate unsupervised alignment methods from general multilingual NLP and semi-supervised learning to bootstrap models. Conversational AI modules will initially target scripted dialogues before advancing to adaptive models as more interaction data becomes available. Continuous user-centered evaluations will guide iterative improvements ensuring practical relevance and robustness."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a logical sequence but lacks concrete strategies and contingency details for several critical challenges. For example, the plan to 'Align ontologies cross-lingually via embedding projection techniques' needs specifying which embedding methods will be used and how alignment quality will be quantitatively assessed. Additionally, the evaluation with multilingual legal experts is mentioned but missing key components such as inter-annotator agreement protocols, metrics for semantic fidelity, and how cultural or jurisdictional nuances will be systematically captured. To improve feasibility, the plan should also address potential data scarcity in less-resourced jurisdictions and detail how minimal expert supervision will be operationalized practically in those contexts. Incorporating these elaborations and risk mitigation strategies will substantially strengthen the scientific soundness and practicability of the experimental setup for this complex multilingual and cross-jurisdictional challenge.\n\nSuggested action: Include specific embedding projection methods (e.g., VecMap, MUSE), define quantitative alignment and explanation quality metrics, elaborate expert evaluation protocols, and detail fallback mechanisms for jurisdictions with limited data or expertise availability within the experiment plan section to solidify feasibility and reproducibility of the work.\n\nTarget section: Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "Given the idea sits in a highly competitive space combining multilingual LLMs, legal ontologies, and explainability, integrating aspects from broader, globally linked concepts can substantially amplify impact and novelty. For instance, incorporating 'human-centered artificial intelligence' principles can enhance explanation frameworks by tailoring them to diverse user groups (e.g., lawyers, judges, citizens) across jurisdictions, ensuring explanations are not only semantically consistent but also cognitively meaningful in varying cultural contexts. Similarly, leveraging 'conversational AI' techniques to develop interactive explanation agents would increase accessibility and practical utility of the system in real-world legal workflows. Moreover, aligning the framework with 'requirements engineering' and 'business process management' methodologies could facilitate mapping legal explanations directly to enterprise risk and compliance processes, broadening relevance and adoption potential. Such integrations would move the proposal beyond a domain-specific technical contribution toward a holistic, socially attuned, and business-relevant intelligent system.\n\nSuggested action: Expand the research scope to incorporate human-centered AI design principles and conversational interfaces, linking with requirements engineering and business process management domains to enhance interdisciplinary novelty and practical impact.\n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"
