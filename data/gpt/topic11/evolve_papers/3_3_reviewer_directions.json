    "title": "Energy-Efficient Adaptive Curriculum Learning for LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Training LLMs with fixed data schedules leads to inefficient resource usage and energy wastage when models are trained on data portions that contribute marginally to learning at certain stages.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the internal gap by integrating green AI principles with adaptive curriculum learning strategies to dynamically optimize training sequences aiming to reduce redundant computations and energy consumption.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive curriculum scheduler that ranks and sequences training samples based on an energy-efficiency impact score calculated via gradient-based measures and energy profiling. The scheduler deprioritizes high-cost but low-impact samples in real time, combined with reinforcement learning to optimize total energy expenditure vs. model performance trade-offs during training.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset: Use large-scale corpora such as BooksCorpus and CC-News. 2) Baselines: Uniform curriculum training, existing curriculum learning strategies. 3) Measure energy consumption, model accuracy, training convergence speed. 4) Analyze correlations between curricular sample order and energy impact. 5) Validate on multiple model scales to test scalability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Training corpus with diverse difficulty samples. Output: Adaptive curriculum logs showing staged sample selection with energy profiles; final model matches baseline accuracy with 25% reduced energy use.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If energy profiling per sample is noisy or expensive, approximate with complexity heuristics or proxy metrics (e.g., token rarity, perplexity). If reinforcement learning fails to converge, test simpler heuristic-based scheduling."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines important evaluation metrics (energy, accuracy, convergence) and datasets, but lacks clarity on how energy consumption will be reliably and reproducibly measured at the granularity of individual curriculum samples. Given the risk of noisy or costly per-sample energy profiling, the plan should explicitly detail instrumentation methods, baselines for energy measurement, and validation protocols for energy-efficiency scores used in scheduling. Additionally, the reinforcement learning component for curriculum optimization requires a clear definition of state/action spaces, reward functions, and convergence criteria to ensure feasibility within large-scale LLM training contexts. Incorporating these specifications will strengthen the scientific soundness and implementation feasibility of the experiments, avoiding ambiguous or intractable evaluation steps at scale. This clarity is essential before proceeding to extensive empirical validation, which is compute-intensive and costly for LLMs at scale, especially when targeting energy-efficiency gains.

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment indicating a highly competitive space, the idea would benefit from concrete integration or inspiration from globally-linked concepts like 'interactive learning experience', 'intelligent decision-making', or 'representation learning' to boost both novelty and broader impact. For instance, incorporating graph representation learning to model inter-sample or curriculum item relationships could enable more intelligent and context-aware sample sequencing, beyond per-sample energy-impact scoring. This could yield a more nuanced adaptive curriculum that better captures latent learning dependencies, improving generalization and energy trade-offs. Similarly, framing the curriculum adaptation as an intelligent decision-making task grounded in educational theory or interactive learning principles could align the approach better with established learning experience paradigms and facilitate transfer beyond LLM training to educational AI systems. Such cross-disciplinary grounding and extension could differentiate the work from competitive baselines and increase its relevance and impact scope.
