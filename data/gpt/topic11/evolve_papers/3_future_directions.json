        "Problem_Statement": "Current data augmentation methods improve model robustness but neglect energy consumption, leading to unnecessary environmental impact during LLM training.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap of lacking integration between standard augmentation techniques and Green AI principles by innovating energy-efficient augmentation methods that maintain data fidelity and model performance while explicitly minimizing energy use.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a data augmentation pipeline that employs energy cost predictors for each augmentation operation. The framework adaptively selects and sequences augmentations to maximize informational gain per unit of energy consumed. It integrates reinforcement learning agents optimized for multi-objective trade-offs between augmentation diversity, model performance, and energy efficiency. This contrasts with prior augmentation methods by embedding a cost-awareness module and sustainability constraints directly into the augmentation strategy.",
