    "title": "Psychological Trait-Conditional Few-Shot Fine-Tuning for Robust Healthcare LLM Inference",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs lack robustness to psychologically conditioned perturbations in healthcare tasks, leading to hallucinations and biased reasoning when patient narratives or clinical texts reflect diverse psychological profiles.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap of limited robustness against medical reasoning perturbations by introducing a novel fine-tuning paradigm conditioning model responses on inferred psychological trait context, enabling more nuanced and stable clinical inference.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a few-shot fine-tuning approach where, alongside clinical inputs, the model receives psychological trait embeddings (e.g., inferred narcissism or agreeableness) as conditioning vectors. The model learns to modulate its reasoning pathways, reducing hallucinations and respecting psychological context. Data augmentation generates synthetic variants across psychological trait spectra to broaden robustness. This multi-modal conditioning mitigates bias propagation linked to patient or annotator traits.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Prepare clinical datasets annotated for psychological traits. 2. Generate augmented sets across trait-value perturbations. 3. Fine-tune healthcare LLMs with trait conditioning inputs. 4. Test on out-of-distribution psychological profiles. 5. Evaluate hallucination frequency, clinical accuracy, and bias reduction against non-conditioned baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical query about treatment options combined with ‘high psychopathy’ trait vector. Output: Clinically sound recommendations with moderated bias reflecting sensitive psychological context.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "Should conditioning vectors confuse model learning, experiment with soft prompting or adapter modules for psychological context injection or simplify to discrete trait category flags."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that conditioning large language models on psychological trait embeddings will reliably reduce hallucinations and bias in healthcare LLM inference needs stronger empirical or theoretical backing. Psychological trait inference from clinical narratives is itself noisy and context-dependent; potential noise in these embeddings may propagate into model outputs. The proposal should clarify how psychological traits are inferred, validated, and integrated to avoid adding spurious signals or unintended bias, as well as discuss potential ethical considerations. Without addressing these, robustness claims remain speculative rather than firmly grounded in model or data realities. This assumption is foundational and requires explicit validation mechanisms early in the project plan to ensure soundness and eventual feasibility of the approach, mitigating risk of misleading clinical outputs due to uncertain psychological conditioning context integration.  Please concretely detail the trait inference pipeline, the robustness of psychological embeddings, and the handling of noisy or conflicting trait signals to confirm this hypothesis before model fine-tuning efforts proceed at scale.  This will greatly strengthen the proposal’s soundness and downstream impact potential in sensitive healthcare settings where errors have high cost, beyond relying on data augmentation alone as noise mitigation.  Overall, please provide stronger justification, theoretical or prior evidence citations, and a clearer explicit plan for validating this assumption upfront in the research roadmap to safeguard clinical utility and trustworthiness of the approach.  This foundational clarity is critical before the costly few-shot fine-tuning and experimental evaluation steps.  Otherwise, the approach risks being built on an unstable or insufficiently justified premise, undermining impact and feasibility simultaneously.  Incorporating thorough validation of psychological trait embeddings and their predictive value for clinical reasoning modulation will greatly enhance soundness and practical value of this novel conditioning paradigm, and its potential novel contributions in healthcare LLM robustness and bias mitigation contexts.  In summary, focus efforts first on strengthening and transparently validating this core assumption to maximize downstream success and societal benefit potentials in the proposed clinical and psychological intersection context, which combines highly delicate, complex, and noisy domains requiring rigorous handling and explanation.  This recommendation addresses a key vulnerability in the proposal’s internal logic and practical utility, and addressing it would markedly improve proposal rigor and confidence in the claimed downstream benefits, which is currently a critical gap inhibiting strong endorsement or funding prioritization at this stage, despite interesting novelty signal.  This is the primary issue to address before or in parallel with development and scaling of the multi-modal conditioning framework, hence the highest priority critique.  Please reconsider experimental pipeline and initial tasks accordingly to reflect these fundamental validation needs and risks before model conditioning refinements and downstream analysis efforts proceed further.

          "feedback_content": "The proposed experimental plan outlines a visionary approach but lacks critical practical details that may impact feasibility and robustness of evaluation. Key issues include: 1) No explicit description of how psychological trait annotations are acquired, which is challenging given the subjective and multi-dimensional nature of these constructs. Clarify data sources, annotation protocols, and inter-annotator reliability measures for these traits. 2) Data augmentation across psychological traits to generalize model robustness is innovative but potentially risky without explicit controls on augmentation fidelity and distributional realism — please detail augmentation methods and how ecological validity of synthetic variants will be ensured. 3) Out-of-distribution testing on psychological profiles is promising but requires carefully designed splits or external datasets reflecting clinically relevant trait distributions — provide concrete dataset examples or simulation plans. 4) Metrics and thresholds for hallucination frequency and bias reduction need to be rigorously defined, possibly relying on human-in-the-loop assessments or clinical expert evaluations due to complexity of clinical reasoning quality measurement. 5) The fallback plan is generic, but it would benefit from preliminary small-scale experiments or ablation studies to validate adapter vs. conditioning-vector approaches. Recommend modifying the step-by-step plan to include these concrete details, explicit milestone definitions, and risk mitigation strategies for practical feasibility and reproducibility. Strengthening this section by concretizing experimental controls, annotation and data generation methods, and evaluation protocol will improve scientific rigor, replicability and confidence in practical deployment potential, thereby maximizing project feasibility and downstream impact.
