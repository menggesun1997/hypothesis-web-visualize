    "title": "Hierarchical Ontology-Grounded Legal LLM Explanations with Minimal Supervision",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current XAI techniques lack domain-adapted explainability methods customized for complex legal texts and large language models (LLMs). There is also insufficient integration of hierarchical legal ontologies and minimal user supervision to cost-effectively generate trustworthy explanations.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses critical gaps of lacking legal domain-specific explainability and ontology integration, plus user supervision scarcity. Innovatively combines hierarchical legal ontologies with minimal supervision strategies, creating semantically grounded, structured explanations unique to legal AI.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a novel explainability framework that overlays structured hierarchical legal ontologies on LLM outputs. Incorporate a minimal supervision annotation interface that leverages active learning with law experts to fine-tune explanation modules. The LLM generates candidate explanations, which are semantically matched and grounded in ontology nodes representing legal concepts, relationships, and regulations. This produces multi-level explanations at textual, conceptual, and legal taxonomic layers, ensuring fidelity and domain relevance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate legal datasets annotated with hierarchical ontologies (e.g., statutes, case law taxonomies). 2. Integrate ontology embeddings into an LLM explainability pipeline trained to generate explanations aligned to ontology concepts. 3. Implement active learning with minimal expert annotations. 4. Compare against baseline LLM explainers without ontology or minimal supervision using metrics assessing semantic coherence, explanation faithfulness, and user trust via law practitioner studies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Contract clause analyzing liability limitations. Output: Multi-level explanation linking clause semantics to specific ontology nodes (e.g., 'Force Majeure' in contract law hierarchy), highlighting reasoning steps referencing applicable regulations, with user-validated explanation segments.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If minimal supervision yields insufficient annotation data, integrate self-supervised learning to bootstrap ontology-aligned explanation embeddings. Alternatively, simulate expert inputs with augmented synthetic annotations based on legal knowledge bases."

        "title": "Hierarchical Ontology-Grounded Legal LLM Explanations with Human-Centered Interaction and Semantic Interoperability under Minimal Supervision",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing explainable AI (XAI) methods for legal large language models (LLMs) inadequately address the dual challenges of generating domain-adapted, trustworthy explanations for complex legal texts and efficiently integrating hierarchical legal ontologies with minimal expert supervision. Moreover, current frameworks often lack interactive, user-centered interfaces and interoperable semantic standards vital for practical deployment in legal technology ecosystems.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work explores ontology integration or legal XAI in isolation, there remains a critical gap in combining hierarchical legal ontologies with minimal supervision in an interactive, human-centered framework that also ensures semantic interoperability with legal knowledge bases. Addressing this gap is imperative to elevate explanation fidelity, user trust, and practical utility. By embedding gaze-based and real-time user feedback mechanisms alongside interoperable knowledge representations, our approach transcends incremental ontology-grounded explainability, enabling cross-system semantic reuse and fostering law practitioner collaboration. This furnishes a novel, multifaceted contribution that is competitive and impactful in the evolving legal AI research landscape.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel explainability framework for legal LLMs that overlays hierarchical legal ontologies onto LLM-generated outputs enhanced by a multi-modal, human-centered explanation interface. Key innovations include: (i) an ontology-aligned explanation generation module integrating semantic embeddings of legal taxonomies, concepts, and regulations; (ii) an active learning pipeline with carefully designed query strategies to optimize expert annotation efficiency; (iii) a real-time user interaction interface including gaze-based tracking and iterative feedback loops that guide and personalize explanation presentation to law practitioners; (iv) embedding explanations into interoperable semantic web standards (e.g., OWL, RDF) ensuring compatibility with external legal knowledge bases and advanced information systems; (v) a layered explanation presentation combining textual, conceptual, and taxonomic legal views to support diverse user needs and tasks. This comprehensive design situates explanations as an interactive, semantically rich knowledge resource that is both human-centered and system-standards aligned.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Ontology and Dataset Curation: Collaborate with legal experts to source and refine a hierarchical legal ontology combining statutes, case law taxonomies, and regulations. Develop a semi-automated pipeline to annotate a dataset of contract clauses and case excerpts at scale (~10K samples) with ontology mappings; establish annotation protocols to maximize consistency. 2. Embedding and Model Integration: Train and integrate ontology embeddings with a legal LLM explanation module, fine-tuned under minimal supervision using active learning with strategically selected queries driven by uncertainty and diversity metrics to prioritize informative samples and minimize expert effort. 3. Interactive Interface Development: Implement gaze-based and feedback-enabled UI components interfacing with law practitioners, capturing interaction metrics to adapt explanation depth and presentation dynamically. 4. Semantic Interoperability Encoding: Formalize generated explanations in OWL/RDF semantic formats, validate compliance and test integration with external legal knowledge graphs. 5. Evaluation Protocols: Use quantitative measures including semantic coherence (embedding-based similarity scores), explanation faithfulness (fidelity metrics comparing LLM outputs and explanations), and annotation efficiency (expert time vs. performance gain). Conduct qualitative user studies with legal practitioners assessing trust, usability, and explanation utility, leveraging interaction logs and surveys. Address scalability and bottlenecks by predefining fallback plans with reduced ontology scope and synthetic data augmentation. This detailed roadmap addresses feasibility challenges and resource needs to ensure successful empirical validation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Contract clause analyzing liability and force majeure conditions. Output: Multi-level explanation: (i) Textual: summary of clause semantics; (ii) Conceptual: mapping to 'Force Majeure' and 'Limitation of Liability' ontology nodes; (iii) Taxonomic: visualization of hierarchical relationships within contract law taxonomy; (iv) Interactive Interface: real-time user gaze data reveals focus areas; interactive feedback solicited on explanation clarity; (v) Semantic Output: OWL/RDF representation linking explanation segments and legal concept URIs enabling reuse and system integration; experts validate explanation segments and provide minimal annotations used to refine the model.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "To counter challenges in expert annotation scarcity, employ self-supervised learning leveraging domain-specific language model pretraining to bootstrap ontology-aligned embeddings. Apply semantic similarity heuristics and distant supervision from existing legal knowledge bases to generate synthetic annotations. For limited ontology scope, prioritize high-impact subdomains (e.g., contract law) to reduce curation complexity. If user interaction proves resource-intensive, simulate user feedback using crowdsourced law students trained on annotation protocols. Further, incorporate automated explanation consistency checks to maintain model fidelity under reduced supervision, ensuring robustness and scalability of the framework."

For instance, sourcing or creating comprehensive hierarchical ontology-annotated datasets is a significant challenge not acknowledged. The plan should include concrete strategies for ontology curation, dataset scale, evaluation protocols for measuring semantic coherence and faithfulness, and concrete criteria for active learning query selection to ensure expert time is used efficiently. Clarify resource requirements and potential bottlenecks to strengthen feasibility claims, especially since legal expert annotation is costly and scarce. Without this, feasibility remains an open question and risks project stagnation early on due to unclear experimental logistics and resource planning. Please elaborate the experiment plan with more operational detail and mitigate risks associated with expert involvement and dataset creation/storage upfront, perhaps with fallback dataset scope or annotation protocols clearly defined and contrasted to baseline methods prone to simpler data needs and evaluation pathways. This refinement will substantively improve confidence that the proposed method can deliver solid empirical evidence in a competitive research landscape. (Target: Experiment_Plan)\"},{\"feedback_code\":\"SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION\",\"target_section\":\"Proposed_Method\",\"feedback_content\":\"Given the novelty is classified as NOV-COMPETITIVE in a crowded domain overlapping legal NLP, explainability, and ontology integration, there is a valuable opportunity to augment the approach via integrating 'human-centered artificial intelligence' principles or 'semantic interoperability' frameworks from the globally-linked concepts. For example, by explicitly designing the explanation interface to support gaze-based interaction or realtime user feedback loops with law practitioners, the system's interactive explainability can greatly enhance user trust and practical utility. Alternatively, embedding the hierarchical ontology-grounded explanations into interoperable knowledge representations compatible with legal knowledge bases or advanced information systems engineering pipelines can improve cross-system reuse and standardization. Such enrichments could elevate the work’s novelty and impact beyond incremental ontology integration by bridging explainability with user-centered design or semantic standards, marking a distinct contribution in legal AI applications.
