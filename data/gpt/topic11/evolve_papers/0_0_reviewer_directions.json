    "title": "Dark-Triad-Informed Bias Filtration for Clinical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs used in healthcare harbor subtle ideological and personality-driven biases, notably political and dark personality trait influences, which impair fairness and decision accuracy in clinical contexts. There is no integrated approach to detect and mitigate these nuanced biases during LLM generation.",
    "Motivation": "This project addresses the critical external gap of integrating dark personality trait theory into bias mitigation for healthcare LLMs, innovating beyond descriptive bias evaluation methods by embedding psychological trait frameworks directly within mitigation techniques.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-stage LLM fine-tuning and inference pipeline that leverages psychological dark triad trait embedding models and political bias classifiers. During fine-tuning, the LLM is regularized using adversarial objectives derived from synthetic perturbations representing dark trait linguistic patterns. At inference, output filtering scores align with personality-based bias likelihoods, rejecting or re-ranking biased responses dynamically. The approach fuses trait theory-derived embeddings with causal mediation analysis to disentangle bias manifestation pathways, enabling targeted counterfactual data augmentation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble healthcare-related dialogue and clinical note datasets enriched with political and psychological trait labels (annotated via domain experts and validated questionnaires). 2. Train separate embedding models for dark traits and political bias signals. 3. Fine-tune GPT-3 or similar LLMs incorporating adversarial bias objectives. 4. Evaluate on USMLE and medical decision-making benchmarks for hallucination and bias metrics. 5. Baselines include standard fine-tuning and existing bias evaluation without psychological integration. Metrics: bias reduction rate, clinical accuracy, hallucination frequency, and fairness scores.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'A patient with symptoms suggesting multiple sclerosis but showing political hostility signs' Output: Filtered clinical advice that avoids biased conflation of psychological traits with diagnosis, producing neutral, evidence-based recommendations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adversarial fine-tuning hinders model performance, pivot to post-hoc bias correction via output re-ranking using a dark-triad-aware classifier. Additionally, increase synthetic data diversity or incorporate human-in-the-loop validation cycles."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that dark triad personality traits and political biases significantly impair clinical LLM fairness and accuracy needs clearer empirical grounding. While psychological traits influence human behavior, evidence that these traits manifest as measurable biases in clinical LLM outputs is not well substantiated in the proposal. The project should incorporate a preliminary validation phase to quantify and characterize such biases in current clinical LLMs, ensuring the theoretical basis for integrating dark triad trait embedding is sound and justified for this domain, rather than speculative or overly broad psychological theory application in clinical settings. This validation will clarify the relevance and scope of the assumed biases targeted by the method, improving the foundational soundness of the research idea in a medical context. The authors should explicitly address how dark triad traits in clinical dialogue influence diagnostic accuracy or recommendations, distinguishing real bias from confounding clinical variables to avoid pursuing an ill-defined problem space within healthcare LLM bias mitigation."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed experiment plan ambitiously combines multi-domain annotation, adversarial fine-tuning, causal mediation analysis, and evaluation on clinical benchmarks, but it lacks detailed operationalization and risk mitigation steps, putting feasibility at risk. For example, obtaining reliable, expert-annotated datasets with simultaneous political and psychological trait labels in clinical contexts is non-trivial and may cause bottlenecks or low inter-annotator agreement. Moreover, the process for training separate embedding models for dark traits and political bias signals requires clarification on modeling choices, training data, and validation. The adversarial regularization during LLM fine-tuning, especially using synthetic perturbations to represent dark trait linguistic patterns, raises questions about clarity in perturbation design, stability of adversarial training, and impact on clinical accuracy. The fallback plan is a good start but should be expanded to clearly delineate decision points and criteria for moving between fine-tuning and post-hoc correction strategies. Enhancing experimental details, timeline estimates, and potential data sourcing strategies will increase confidence in execution feasibility and scientific rigor."
