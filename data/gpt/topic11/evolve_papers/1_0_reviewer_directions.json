    "title": "Federated Homomorphic Encryption for Privacy-Preserving Financial LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM deployments in financial services inadequately protect sensitive user data during model training and inference, risking regulatory non-compliance and privacy breaches.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap of integrating cryptographic privacy-preserving techniques explicitly tailored for financial LLMs by synergizing federated learning with homomorphic encryption, meeting the need for cross-disciplinary privacy and cybersecurity integration.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a dual-layer privacy framework combining federated learning to decentralize training across financial institutions with homomorphic encryption to enable encrypted inference without decrypting data. Architect a privacy-preserving LLM pipeline enabling joint model fine-tuning and real-time encrypted query responses while enforcing data sovereignty and ensuring regulatory compliance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble de-identified financial transaction datasets from multiple institutions. 2) Develop an LLM architecture adapted for encrypted federated training. 3) Compare baseline centralized models with federated homomorphic encryption models on utility and privacy leakage metrics. 4) Evaluate compliance adherence via simulated audit inspections. Metrics: model accuracy, privacy leakage rates, computational overhead, compliance audit pass/fail rates.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An encrypted customer query \"What is my current credit card balance?\" Output: The LLM returns an encrypted response correctly decrypted by the customer, demonstrating privacy preservation with accurate financial information retrieval.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If homomorphic encryption overhead is prohibitive, fallback to secure multi-party computation protocols to maintain data privacy. Alternatively, evaluate partial encryption approaches with risk-based data exposure control."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed dual-layer privacy framework combining federated learning (FL) with homomorphic encryption (HE) is conceptually strong but lacks clarity on integrating these two computationally intensive techniques in practice. Detailed architectural design is needed to explain how encrypted inference queries operate efficiently over the distributed federated model without prohibitive latency. In particular, the mechanism for joint model fine-tuning under encryption and the management of key distribution or encryption schemes across multiple financial institutions require elaboration to ensure secure yet practical deployment. Clarify how encryption overheads are balanced with model convergence and real-time query responsiveness to solidify soundness of the method's mechanism and deployment assumptions in a strict regulatory environment. This will also address regulatory compliance integration challenges implied but not detailed in the current description, increasing confidence in feasibility and soundness of the core method's operation within privacy constraints and financial domain requirements. Please provide algorithmic flow, cryptographic protocol choices, and how the LLM architecture is adapted for encrypted federated learning scenarios, possibly with references to state-of-the-art techniques in this intersection area to ascertain novelty and rigor of the planned approach."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan outlines relevant benchmarking metrics and data usage but needs refinement to demonstrate feasibility robustly. Assembling de-identified financial transaction datasets from multiple institutions is non-trivial due to legal and compliance burdens; outline concrete dataset sources or synthetic counterparts to realistically enable training. The plan should also clarify how the experiments will manage and measure computational overhead from homomorphic encryption in practice, including hardware requirements or optimizations. Evaluation of compliance should extend beyond simulated audits to incorporate formal privacy certification (e.g., differential privacy guarantees or formal proofs) where possible; this strengthens claims of regulatory adherence. Baseline centralized models need clearer specification (model types, hyperparameters) for fair comparison. Including ablation studies for each privacy component (federated learning only vs. federated+HE vs. fallback secure multi-party computation) would yield insightful performance-privacy tradeoffs. Addressing these aspects concretely will improve experimental feasibility and rigor, ensuring the study yields actionable insights on practicality, utility, and regulatory acceptance in realistic financial environments."
