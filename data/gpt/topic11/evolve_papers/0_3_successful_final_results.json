        "title": "Causal Mediation Networks Integrating Dark Trait Linguistics for Bias Source Attribution with Rigorous Variable Identification and Incremental Validation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Biases in healthcare large language models (LLMs) frequently arise from complex, intertwined psychological and political influences embedded within clinical textual training data. Existing methods insufficiently enable causal attribution and disentanglement of these bias sources, limiting targeted mitigation strategies and hindering safe, equitable AI deployment in real-world clinical settings.",
        "Motivation": "To address the critical gap in nuanced bias mitigation, this work integrates causal mediation analysis with rigorously validated linguistic feature extraction of dark personality traits. By explicitly defining mediator variables and identification assumptions in structural causal models tailored for clinical language, the approach enables interpretable and causally sound bias source separation. This advancement surpasses prior correlational or shallow bias analyses, offering robust, theoretically grounded insights essential for AI safety and trustworthy deployment in healthcare environments such as University Clinics of Kinshasa and beyond.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-stage causal mediation framework combining theoretical and empirical rigor: 1) Define candidate mediators through a systematic literature review linking dark trait linguistic markers to validated psychological constructs, ensuring these features capture causal psychological states rather than spurious correlations. 2) Use domain expert elicitation to construct plausible structural causal graphs specifying pathways from input text features to biased latent variables mediating LLM outputs. 3) Implement a variable identification strategy leveraging conditional independence tests and sensitivity analyses tailored for high-dimensional textual embeddings to detect and validate mediators. 4) Integrate linguistic markers as measured mediators and biased latent variables as latent mediators identified via proxy methods (e.g., data augmentation contrasts). 5) Employ mediation effect estimation with strong causal assumptions clearly stated and tested, involving instrumental variable techniques where appropriate to isolate bias influence. 6) Connect this framework with knowledge discovery and data mining pipelines to enhance interpretability and facilitate downstream AI assistance tools supporting clinical decision-making. This comprehensive modeling approach balances causal rigor with real-world applicability for deployment in clinical NLP systems presented at venues such as the Pacific-Asia Conference, advancing frontier language model bias understanding and mitigation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Conduct a pilot annotation phase on a modest-size clinical text dataset, employing trained annotators and domain experts to label dark personality linguistic markers and political bias with detailed guidelines, ensuring annotation quality via inter-annotator agreement metrics. 2. Develop synthetic and semi-synthetic clinical text datasets embedding known causal bias mediation structures to validate model assumptions and mediation effect estimation reliability; use these to tune model hyperparameters and validate training stability. 3. Define precise causal graphs and mediator sets informed by literature and pilot labeling; perform conditional independence tests and causal discovery methods to iteratively refine causal models. 4. Train LLMs with mediation-informed regularization incorporating safeguards such as early stopping, and monitor convergence properties; perform ablation studies comparing mediation-aware and baseline models. 5. Establish quantitative criteria and fallback timelines: if mediation proxies or instrumental variables prove unreliable, systematically switch to approximate mediation or simpler bias attribution strategies. 6. Scale annotation efforts guided by pilot results to reach statistically powered sample sizes, with continuous quality checks and annotation updates. 7. Evaluate methods on clinical prediction accuracy, bias causal effect size, fairness metrics, and deployment readiness measures tied to AI safety considerations in healthcare contexts.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A patient note containing linguistic expressions exhibiting subtle indicators of Machiavellianism and covert political bias. Output: Mediation attribution scores quantifying the extent to which each validated mediator variable (e.g., Machiavellianism linguistic features) and latent biased variables influence model output inaccuracies, alongside confidence intervals and sensitivity analyses validating causal claims.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If rigorous causal mediation modeling faces instability or identification failures, pivot to proxy variable approaches that approximate mediation effects by leveraging auxiliary data sources or partial supervision. Parallelly, adopt well-established instrumental variable techniques to isolate bias effects, validating results through synthetic data experiments. This fallback maintains interpretability and bias attribution capabilities even when full causal assumptions cannot be satisfied, ensuring robust, actionable insights for clinical NLP bias mitigation."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a sophisticated causal mediation framework leveraging dark trait linguistic markers and latent biased variables, but it lacks clarity on how these latent variables will be identified or validated within the model. The causal graphs and structural causal models need further specification, especially regarding how textual embeddings align with causally meaningful mediators and whether the markers for dark traits can validly capture psychological states rather than correlational signals. To improve, explicitly define the causal variable selection process, the identification strategy for mediators in text, and clarify assumptions required for causal claims to hold in this complex high-dimensional setting, ensuring the soundness of mediation interpretations in LLM outputs. This will strengthen the theoretical grounding and reproducibility of the mediation analysis approach in the clinical NLP context, reducing potential confounds or spurious mediation pathways that undermine bias attribution accuracy.

Annotation complexity and subjectivity may hamper data quality and reproducibility. Additionally, incorporating mediation-informed regularization into LLM training is highly non-trivial and merits a more detailed procedural breakdown or pilot validation step to assess stability and convergence. To enhance feasibility, propose incremental validation experiments focusing initially on synthetic or semi-synthetic data to prove mediation effect estimation reliability, and provide fallback timelines and quantitative criteria to judge when to switch to proxy or instrumental variable methods. Articulating concrete annotation strategies, sample size estimates, and model training safeguards will ensure the experiment plan is grounded and achievable.
