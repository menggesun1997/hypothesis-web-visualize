    "title": "Visual-Legal Ontology Embedding Alignment for Enhanced Multi-Modal Explainability",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of semantic grounding connecting vision-language model embeddings with hierarchical legal ontologies prevents deep multi-modal explainability in legal AI.",
    "Motivation": "Combines hierarchical ontologies with emerging multi-modal vision-language models by aligning their embedding spaces, addressing the gap between hierarchical data structure integration and multi-modal modalities.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an embedding alignment framework that jointly learns mappings between visual feature embeddings (from document images, charts) and ontology concept embeddings. This facilitates seamless fusion in the explanation generator, producing synchronized text-image explanations grounded in legal ontologies for holistic interpretability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect paired datasets of legal images and text tagged with ontology concepts. 2. Train mapping neural networks to align visual and ontology embedding spaces. 3. Integrate into a multi-modal explanation system. 4. Evaluate alignment quality, explanation consistency, and user interpretability in legal annotation tasks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Corporate financial report with text discussing compliance and accompanying chart images. Output: Explanations linking text and visual data tagged and explained through aligned ontology concepts representing regulatory compliance.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If embedding alignment is noisy, explore attention-based cross-modal fusion without explicit embedding projection or augment with contrastive learning losses to improve alignment."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks detailed clarity on how the joint embedding alignment will be technically achieved, especially concerning the learning architecture and loss functions used to ensure semantic consistency between visual and ontology embeddings. You should elaborate on the specific neural network architectures, how hierarchical ontology structures are incorporated, and how the model handles varying modalities in a unified framework to avoid ambiguous or ineffective alignment. Providing these details will strengthen the soundness of the methodology and facilitate reproducibility and evaluation by peers and reviewers alike. For example, clarify whether you use contrastive learning, graph neural networks for ontology encoding, or transformer-based fusion, and how the embeddings are regularized or supervised to reflect legal ontologies accurately in the visual domain, beyond the fallback plans mentioned in vague terms (Proposed_Method section)."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is promising but needs more rigorous design to ensure feasibility. Key aspects missing include the proposed dataset sources, scale, and annotation protocol for pairing legal images and text with ontology concepts, which is non-trivial in the legal domain and might require expert annotation or complex data synthesis. Also, the evaluation metrics for alignment quality, explanation consistency, and user interpretability remain broadly described; please specify quantitative measures (e.g., alignment accuracy, retrieval metrics, ROUGE or BLEU for explanations) and qualitative user study designs. Finally, address potential obstacles such as noisy or incomplete annotations and how these will be mitigated experimentally. Better defining these experiment details will increase confidence in the feasibility of your approach (Experiment_Plan section)."
