While many of these reviews detailed the adverse impact of assessment on learning, they also indicated that under certain conditions assessment had considerable potential to enhance learning. It is shown that understanding the impact that assessment has on learning requires a broader focus than the feedback intervention itself, particularly the learner's responses to the feedback, and the learning milieu in which the feedback operates. Different definitions of the terms “formative assessment” and “assessment for learning” are discussed, and subsumed within a broad definition that focuses on the extent to which instructional decisions are supported by evidence. The paper concludes by exploring some of the consequences of this definition for classroom practice.\"}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'The Power of Feedback', 'abstract': 'Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on learning and achievement, but this impact can be either positive or negative. Its power is frequently mentioned in articles about learning and teaching, but surprisingly few recent studies have systematically investigated its meaning. This article provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement. This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Focus on Formative Feedback', 'abstract': 'This article reviews the corpus of research on feedback, with a focus on formative feedback—defined as information communicated to the learner that is intended to modify his or her thinking or behavior to improve learning. According to researchers, formative feedback should be nonevaluative, supportive, timely, and specific. Formative feedback is usually presented as information to a learner in response to some action on the learner’s part. It comes in a variety of types (e.g., verification of response accuracy, explanation of the correct answer, hints, worked examples) and can be administered at various times during the learning process (e.g., immediately following an answer, after some time has elapsed). Finally, several variables have been shown to interact with formative feedback’s success at promoting learning (e.g., individual characteristics of the learner and aspects of the task).

We used Likert scale analysis and inductive free-text categorization to assess the quality of the simplified reports.ResultsMost radiologists agreed that the simplified reports were factually correct, complete, and not potentially harmful to the patient. Nevertheless, instances of incorrect statements, missed relevant medical information, and potentially harmful passages were reported.ConclusionWhile we see a need for further adaption to the medical field, the initial insights of this study indicate a tremendous potential in using LLMs like ChatGPT to improve patient-centered care in radiology and other medical domains.Clinical relevance statementPatients have started to use ChatGPT to simplify and explain their medical reports, which is expected to affect patient-doctor interaction. This phenomenon raises several opportunities and challenges for clinical routine.Key Points• Patients have started to use ChatGPT to simplify their medical reports, but their quality was unknown.• In a questionnaire, most participating radiologists overall asserted good quality to radiology reports simplified with ChatGPT. However, they also highlighted a notable presence of errors, potentially leading patients to draw harmful conclusions.• Large language models such as ChatGPT have vast potential to enhance patient-centered care in radiology and other medical domains. To realize this potential while minimizing harm, they need supervision by medical experts and adaption to the medical field.Graphical Abstract'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'BioBERT: a pre-trained biomedical language representation model for biomedical text mining', 'abstract': 'MOTIVATION: Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important as the number of biomedical documents rapidly grows. With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora.\\nRESULTS: We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24% MRR improvement). Our analysis results show that pre-training BERT on biomedical corpora helps it to understand complex biomedical texts.\\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We make the pre-trained weights of BioBERT freely available at https://github.com/naver/biobert-pretrained, and the source code for fine-tuning BioBERT available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert.'}]\n```\n\n**Part A.2: The Evolution Links (Edges of the Graph):**\nThe following list defines the citation relationships between the papers in Part A.

    "current_research_landscape": "The current state-of-the-art in evaluating privacy-preserving architectures for large language models (LLMs), particularly in domains such as education and healthcare, centers on leveraging formative assessment activities and interactive learning paradigms to promote better teaching and learning outcomes. This approach evolved from earlier foundational work emphasizing feedback mechanisms and assessment for learning, which highlights the importance of evidence-based instructional decisions. Contemporary research notably integrates domain-specific adaptations of LLMs (e.g., BioBERT in biomedical text mining) and explores the transformative potential of generative AI tools like ChatGPT across various fields. Central to recent efforts is the focus on deploying these models within specialized fields to enhance accuracy, usability, and relevance—acknowledging the critical role of technology experts to improve educational praxis and student learning through interactive and personalized applications. These insights form a conceptual backbone relevant to financial services, where privacy preservation and domain adaptation are paramount.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps center on the limited exploration of LLM privacy-preserving mechanisms explicitly tailored for financial services—a sensitive and highly regulated domain markedly absent from the evolutionary trajectory analyzed. Despite advances in domain-specific model tuning (e.g., biomedical domain), there is a notable oversight in how formative feedback and assessment methodologies translate within privacy-preserving frameworks for financial data. Similarly, current research insufficiently addresses the risk of generating harmful or incorrect outputs when models interact with sensitive financial information. External or novel gaps emerge due to the absence of cross-disciplinary bridges identified in global co-occurrence analysis—no evident integration with cybersecurity, cryptographic techniques (e.g., homomorphic encryption, federated learning), or regulatory compliance fields such as data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA). This lack signals missed opportunities to synergize AI advances with rigorous privacy frameworks, risk management, and financial ethics.",
