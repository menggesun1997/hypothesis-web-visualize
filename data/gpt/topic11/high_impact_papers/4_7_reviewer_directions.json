    "title": "Dynamic Ethical Compliance Audit Framework Using Continuous Human-AI Oversight",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current AI moderation systems lack continuous, adaptive audit mechanisms that incorporate both human oversight and AI explainability to ensure ongoing ethical compliance in evolving social media contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Integrates organizational transformation and XAI gaps by establishing an evolving audit framework that adaptively oversees AI fairness and ethics. Moves beyond static audits towards dynamic socio-technical governance.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement an audit platform combining automated metrics monitoring (bias, fairness indicators), human-in-the-loop review panels, and explainability dashboards. Include configurable alerts for ethical risk deviations and feedback mechanisms to update AI models and policies in near real-time, ensuring accountability and transparency throughout deployment.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Define comprehensive ethical compliance indicators. 2. Build audit platform prototype. 3. Deploy in controlled moderation environments. 4. Measure effectiveness through incident detection and resolution speed. 5. Gather moderator and stakeholder responses on audit transparency and fairness. 6. Refine alert thresholds and feedback cycles.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Audit detects statistically significant increase in false positives for a demographic group. Human reviewers investigate explanations, re-tune AI thresholds, and document corrective actions transparently.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If automated alerts prove noisy, incorporate multi-factor scoring to reduce false alarms. Alternatively, develop periodic audit schedules integrated with organizational review meetings."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed method outlines a comprehensive framework combining automated monitoring, human review, and explainability dashboards, it lacks detailed explanation of how the continuous feedback loop updates AI models and policies in near-real time. Clarify the mechanism and tools enabling adaptive updates to ensure the system’s responsiveness to detected ethical risks without introducing instability or latency in deployment environments. Additionally, specify how explainability dashboards concretely support human auditors in interpreting complex model behaviors to facilitate actionable decisions rather than producing overwhelming or superficial information outputs, which is a known challenge in current XAI systems. Enhancing clarity on these mechanisms will solidify the framework’s soundness and practical utility in dynamic social media moderation contexts at scale. Targeted details about integration of explainability into human-in-the-loop decision workflows and technical approaches for feedback-driven model tuning will strengthen confidence in the approach’s novelty and contribution to socio-technical governance of AI ethics in deployment."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE, integrating concepts from 'decision support', 'machine learning', and 'clinical decision support' could elevate the impact and differentiate this research. Specifically, consider adapting advanced multi-sensor fusion and IoT-based sensor network techniques to create richer, real-time multi-modal data inputs capturing social context, user behaviors, and platform dynamics beyond text and metadata. Incorporating AI methods from clinical decision support systems — which robustly combine algorithmic alerts with expert human judgment under uncertainty — may inform the design of audit feedback loops that balance automated detection with human judgment effectively. Such cross-domain methodological borrowing can significantly enhance feasibility, robustness, and impact of the dynamic ethical audit framework, positioning it as a next-generation socio-technical governance tool addressing complex, evolving ethical risks in AI moderation systems."
