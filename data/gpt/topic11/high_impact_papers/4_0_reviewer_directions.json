    "title": "Adaptive Socio-Technical Moderation Framework Using Organizational Learning and XAI Feedback Loops",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current social media moderation powered by large language models (LLMs) lacks adaptive frameworks that systematically integrate continuous organizational learning with explainable AI feedback to ensure fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics (FATE). Existing solutions suffer from static rule enforcement and opaque decision-making, impairing trust, and responsiveness to evolving societal norms.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of fragmented integration between communication/media studies and XAI and the external gap involving the underutilized application of organizational learning theories and digital leadership to drive dynamic AI governance. This approach transforms how adaptive, transparent, and human-centered moderation systems evolve by embedding learning cycles and explainability directly into AI governance frameworks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a socio-technical framework that couples LLM-driven moderation with organizational learning mechanisms. Integrate continuous feedback loops from moderators and community stakeholders via explainable AI modules that provide interpretable rationales (leveraging LIME and SHAP) for moderation decisions. Design digital leadership protocols that use this feedback to update moderation policies dynamically. Employ hybrid models combining reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with organizational change management processes to iteratively adjust AI behavior and governance rules in an accountable and transparent manner.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect moderated social media datasets across evolving policy periods. 2. Implement baseline LLM moderation with static policies. 3. Develop the proposed adaptive framework with integrated XAI explanations and organizational learning feedback loops. 4. Evaluate improvements via metrics on fairness (demographic parity, equality of opportunity), accountability (auditability scores), transparency (explanation fidelity), and ethics (bias metrics). 5. Conduct user studies with moderators assessing trust and usability. 6. Compare dynamic vs. static governance impacts on moderation quality and organizational responsiveness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User posts a borderline hate speech content on a platform. The LLM provides a moderation decision with an explanation (e.g., highlighting specific phrases triggering hate speech flags). Feedback from moderators disagrees with the decision and provides contextual insight. The system logs this input and adjusts the moderation criteria in the next update cycle, reducing false positives and improving fairness.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time adaptation is unstable, implement batched policy updates using periodic organizational review panels aggregating moderated feedback. Alternatively, focus on enhancing explanation quality as a first step before incorporating organizational learning loops fully."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan, while comprehensive, lacks specificity regarding how the organizational learning mechanisms and digital leadership protocols will be operationalized, measured, and validated in practice. For example, the plan does not clarify how feedback from moderators and community stakeholders will be systematically collected, aggregated, and incorporated into model updates beyond high-level descriptions. This vagueness introduces risk for feasibility and reproducibility, especially given the complex socio-technical interactions involved. Strengthening this section with concrete designs for feedback instrumentation, update schedules, and measurable governance adaptation criteria will improve clarity and practical executability of the approach, increasing confidence that the method can be meaningfully evaluated and iterated upon in real-world conditions. Consider also clearly defining metrics or qualitative indicators for the organizational learning cycle and leadership effectiveness alongside AI performance metrics for a holistic assessment framework that aligns tightly with the proposed interdisciplinary integration goals. This refinement is crucial for convincing reviewers and stakeholders of the feasibility and scientific rigor of the proposed evaluation methodology in this ambitious research space, where bridging social science and AI system experimentation is notoriously challenging yet essential for impact success and adoption potential in governance contexts. Target Section: Experiment_Plan; Feedback Code: FEA-EXPERIMENT. Impact: IMP-BROADEN_IMPACT. Suggestion: SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION. Please note only the top two critiques are reported here per instructions. The above expands the top critique with a strong focus on feasibility and impact applicability to ground the innovation more solidly in experimental design and evaluation rigor. The next critique is provided following this one for balanced coverage of soundness and impact scope considerations without overwhelming focus on minor details first."

          "feedback_code": "IMP-BROADEN_IMPACT",
          "feedback_content": "While the research tackles critical social media moderation challenges integrating explainability and organizational learning, its framing and test cases remain narrowly scoped around moderation of hate speech and policy adjustment feedback within social media platforms. The project could broaden its impact and novelty by more explicitly targeting generalization beyond social media moderationâ€”for example, applying the adaptive socio-technical framework to other domains involving sensitive content governance or complex human-AI decision-making environments such as healthcare information filtering, educational content moderation, or privacy-sensitive IoT device communication management. This cross-domain framing would better emphasize the transformative potential and scalability of the proposed framework, increasing appeal to a larger audience and funding bodies. Additionally, linking the work more concretely with globally relevant concerns like AI fairness, ethical decision-making, and human-centered AI (from your linked concepts) would ground the proposal in central interdisciplinary challenges with widespread research and societal interest. Expanded framing and example scenarios beyond hate speech detection will help position this research to not only advance social media governance but also serve as a generalizable model for adaptive, transparent AI governance in various complex, socio-technical systems that require trust and continual learning from diverse stakeholders.
