        "title": "Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Clinical Interpretability Layer for Trustworthy Decision Support LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to healthcare decision support suffer from limited transparency and interpretability, which undermines clinician trust and hampers safe integration into clinical workflows.",
        "Motivation": "While existing LLM interpretability approaches generate explanations, they often lack explicit grounding in clinical knowledge, leading to limited fidelity, trustworthiness, and applicability in real-world healthcare. To overcome these challenges and address the NOV-COMPETITIVE verdict, this work proposes a novel integration of domain-specific biomedical knowledge graphs with clinical language models. This fusion enriches causality extraction and rationale generation, enabling explainable AI outputs that are medically grounded, patient-tailored, and compliant with clinical guidelines. By leveraging attention mechanisms and few-shot learning within this knowledge-enhanced framework, we aim to significantly improve explanation quality, reliability, and adaptability across varied clinical domains, ultimately fostering clinician trust and safer decision support.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an advanced NLP interpretability module combining: (1) supervised deep learning-based named entity recognition and relation extraction models fine-tuned on clinical textual datasets including the Italian Electronic Health Record corpus; (2) integration of a curated biomedical knowledge graph encoding clinical concepts, guidelines, and causal pathways, which provides an explicit clinical context and constraints for explanations; and (3) a causality extraction framework augmented by the knowledge graph to identify causally relevant entities and relations. Explanations and rationales for LLM predictions are then generated via a clinically aligned natural language generation component that references patient-specific data, relevant guideline nodes from the knowledge graph, and explicit causal inference pathways. Attention mechanisms help highlight salient input features and graph components. Few-shot learning strategies enable domain adaptation and generalization to new clinical cohorts with limited annotations. This knowledge graph-enhanced interpretability layer operates as an interactive interface giving clinicians transparent, evidence-backed, medically consistent explanations with actionable insights.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Preparation: Aggregate and preprocess clinical note corpora annotated for entities, relations, and causality, including public resources like the Italian Electronic Health Record corpus and benchmark datasets for biomedical NLP. 2) Knowledge Graph Construction: Curate and integrate a biomedical knowledge graph combining clinical guidelines, ontologies (e.g., SNOMED CT, UMLS), and evidence-based causal relations relevant to target diseases. 3) Model Training: Fine-tune supervised deep learning models with attention mechanisms for entity recognition and relation extraction, leveraging domain-specific language models. Implement few-shot learning pipelines for adaptability to unseen clinical settings. 4) Interpretability Module Development: Integrate causality extraction augmented by the knowledge graph, linking patient data to graph nodes, and generate natural language rationales citing guideline-supported evidence paths. 5) Quantitative Evaluation: Measure interpretability outputs using intrinsic metrics (BLEU, ROUGE for language quality), causality extraction precision/recall/F-scores on annotated test sets, and faithfulness metrics including causal alignment scores comparing explanations to knowledge graph ground truths. 6) Clinical Relevance Validation: Conduct blinded clinician evaluations assessing explanation clinical relevance, usefulness, trustworthiness, and safety, supported by standardized questionnaires and interviews. 7) Safety and Fidelity Testing: Perform simulated deployment studies where clinicians interact with the system in realistic scenarios, measuring decision confidence, error rates, and potential misleading explanations. Apply rigorous safety thresholds; if NLP explanations fall below predefined trustworthiness or safety benchmarks, switch to fallback hybrid symbolic-NLP templates ensuring medically grounded rationale. 8) Iterative Refinement: Use feedback loops from clinician testing and safety assessments to refine models, knowledge graph coverage, and explanation generation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A complex clinical note including patient symptoms, lab results, and past medical history. Output: A diagnosis prediction accompanied by a stepwise rationale that: (i) highlights causally relevant symptoms and lab markers extracted via attention-based entity and relation extraction, (ii) links each rationale step to corresponding biomedical knowledge graph nodes and clinical guidelines (e.g., citing dose thresholds, pathophysiological mechanisms), and (iii) delivers a natural language explanation, patient-specific and evidence-backed, increasing clinician acceptance and informing clinical decision-making.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should the NLP-driven explanation module fail to meet predefined thresholds for explanation fidelity, causality correctness, or safety in real-world-like scenarios, fallback to a hybrid symbolic-NLP approach will be employed. This approach uses pre-defined rule-based templates grounded explicitly in clinical guidelines and knowledge graph heuristics to produce conservative but medically trustworthy rationales, ensuring no misleading or unsafe explanations are presented to clinicians while maintaining transparency and alignment with clinical best practices."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while comprehensive, lacks detail on how the interpretability module’s outputs will be quantitatively and qualitatively validated for clinical relevance beyond standard NLP metrics (e.g., BLEU) and clinician ratings. Specifically, the plan should clarify how causality extraction and rationale generation will be operationalized and benchmarked against existing clinical decision support interpretability methods. Furthermore, it is unclear how patient-specific data and clinical guidelines integration will be standardized and verified to ensure fidelity and safety in real clinical scenarios, which is crucial for feasibility and deployment. Addressing these points by defining specific evaluation protocols, datasets, and success criteria will improve scientific rigor and practical viability of the experiments. This will also support safety assessments in the simulated deployment stage to mitigate risks of misleading explanations in healthcare applications.  This is essential for ensuring the method is both scientifically sound and practically feasible to implement safely in clinical environments.  Please elaborate and concretize these aspects in the experiment design and validation strategy sections of the proposal, including fallback evaluation to the proposed hybrid rule-based approaches if the NLP explanations do not meet safety and trustworthiness thresholds at scale or in real-world-like conditions.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "To enhance both novelty and impact beyond the competitive landscape, consider integrating a knowledge graph-based component leveraging biomedical NLP and clinical language models to enrich the interpretability layer. Incorporating a domain-specific knowledge graph can improve causality extraction and rationale generation by grounding explanations in an explicit, formalized clinical knowledge structure, which can help enforce medically grounded rationales and facilitate alignment with clinical guidelines. This approach can also leverage attention mechanisms and supervised deep learning models trained on clinically annotated textual data such as electronic health records (potentially including public resources like the Italian Electronic Health Record corpus) to improve entity and relation extraction accuracy. Additionally, incorporating few-shot learning setups might enable adaptation to new clinical domains or patient cohorts with limited annotation, increasing scalability and generalization. This global integration would strengthen the proposal’s methodological rigor, uniqueness, and real-world applicability in clinical decision support, addressing trust and safety concerns more robustly while situating the work at the intersection of state-of-the-art biomedical NLP and clinical AI interpretability research trends."
