    "title": "EcoXAI: Real-Time Environmental Transparency for LLM Training",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current AI training pipelines of large language models lack integrated, interpretable environmental impact metrics, making it difficult to understand and mitigate the ecological footprint during training.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the internal gap of underexplored integration of environmental impact metrics into AI workflows, leveraging the near-infrared spectroscopy analogy for precise monitoring, combined with XAI interpretability paradigms. It offers a novel, real-time ecological transparency tool for practitioners.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop EcoXAI, a modular software framework that employs sensor data analogous to near-infrared spectral analysis to monitor energy consumption, heat generation, and carbon emissions during neural network training. This data is fed into interpretable XAI modules that visualize and explain, in real time, how architectural choices and training configurations affect ecological metrics. The system supports integration with common ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) and presents dashboards for multi-dimensional trade-off analysis between performance and environmental impact.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect energy and environmental data during training of benchmark LLMs (e.g., GPT-2, BERT) using specialized hardware sensors and system metrics.\n2. Develop interpretable models mapping architectural elements and hyperparameters to environmental impact data.\n3. Implement EcoXAI dashboard and real-time feedback loops.\n4. Evaluate on standard NLP benchmarks and measure accuracy, energy usage, and user interpretability through expert studies.\n5. Compare with existing post-hoc environmental reporting methods.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Start training BERT-base with EcoXAI enabled.\nOutput: Real-time dashboard shows spikes in power consumption correlated to batch size increments, with interpretable explanations suggesting energy-saving batch sizes with minimal accuracy loss.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time monitoring is noisy or inaccurate, fallback to batched post-training environmental assessments. Explore alternative environmental proxies such as workload-based estimations if sensors fail. Adjust interpretability models to simpler surrogate models if complexity overwhelms users."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan relies heavily on specialized hardware sensors and system metrics to collect environmental data during large-scale LLM training. This raises concerns regarding feasibility, as procuring, calibrating, and integrating such sensors with existing ML infrastructure (e.g., cloud environments or distributed training) can be non-trivial and might limit broader applicability. Additionally, real-time data collection at the scale of models like GPT-2 or BERT may introduce overhead or noise affecting training or measurement accuracy. It is recommended to elaborate on how hardware integration challenges, measurement noise, and system overhead will be addressed and to explore scalable simulation or proxy metrics that do not rely exclusively on specialized sensors to ensure practicality and broader adoption in diverse training settings, including distributed and cloud-based environments. This clarification would strengthen the experimental design’s scientific soundness and practical feasibility to realize EcoXAI effectively in real-world scenarios and large-scale systems environments with varied hardware setups and deployment constraints. Targets to expand and specify fallback strategies in concrete terms beyond the high-level fallback plan would also be beneficial for robustness and success of evaluation steps in realistic conditions where sensor data access might be limited or noisy, to avoid disruptions to research progress and evaluation completeness.  Consider benchmarking initial prototypes on smaller scale setups to validate data fidelity and real-time feedback mechanisms before scaling. Moreover, including alternative data sources such as workload method-based estimations or system logs as complementary inputs can improve resilience of the approach under practical deployment constraints. Overall, enhancing the experiment plan with these practical considerations and contingencies will improve feasibility assessment and project viability confidence significantly.  \n\n---\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the interdisciplinary nature involving environmental metrics, XAI, and LLM training, there is a strong opportunity to leverage linked concepts such as 'distributed computing' and 'big data analytics' to broaden and deepen EcoXAI’s novelty and impact. For example, integrating techniques from distributed computing can enable EcoXAI to efficiently aggregate environmental data and interpretability signals across multi-node or federated training architectures, which are increasingly common in LLM training pipelines. This could augment EcoXAI’s scalability and applicability in contemporary large-scale AI development contexts. Furthermore, coupling with 'big data analytics' methods can facilitate more sophisticated, data-driven modeling of environmental impact patterns and emergent trade-offs across multiple training runs and model variants, enabling practitioners to discover deeper insights beyond single-training-session dashboards. Such integration can also help in applying evolutionary computation or optimization methods (linked concept) for automated energy-model trade-off tuning based on real-time feedback. By explicitly tying the EcoXAI framework to these advanced fields, the project can transcend being a specialized tool and position itself as part of a larger paradigm of sustainable, data-driven AI development workflows, thus greatly enhancing its appeal, adoption potential, and research contribution to the AI and environmental sustainability communities. Including this direction in the revision would strengthen the paper’s contribution and originality claims amidst a competitive landscape. "
