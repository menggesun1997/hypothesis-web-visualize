        "title": "Robust Econometric Disentanglement in Federated Healthcare LLMs with Causal Validity and Heterogeneity-aware Experimentation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing disentanglement methods fall short in effectively separating complex socioeconomic confounders from clinical signals in healthcare LLMs trained across heterogeneous, distributed datasets without data centralization, limiting fairness and generalizability.",
        "Motivation": "To significantly advance fairness and causal interpretability in federated healthcare LLMs by rigorously integrating econometric instrumental variable (IV) based disentanglement with federated learning, while addressing foundational challenges of instrument validity, heterogeneity, and privacy constraints often overlooked in prior work. This proposal also pioneers context-aware attention mechanisms inspired by biological vision to enhance disentanglement of socioeconomic biases under out-of-distribution scenarios, thus delivering a fundamentally novel and practically robust approach distinct from existing techniques.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a theoretically grounded econometric disentanglement module embedded within federated LLM updates, incorporating: (1) explicit selection and validation of instrumental variables at each federation site via domain-guided statistical and causal tests to ensure IV strength and relevance despite noncentralized data; (2) a novel heterogeneity-aware causal inference framework that models distribution shifts and varying confounders across sites to maintain causal identifiability; (3) integration of a biologically-inspired context-aware attention mechanism to dynamically weight socioeconomic confounders in clinical representations, improving disentanglement and robustness to out-of-distribution data common in healthcare; (4) deployment on federated infrastructures supporting privacy-preserving causal estimation using secure multiparty computation and differential privacy; (5) an open-source software stack based on federated learning platforms augmented with econometric and vision-inspired modules to enable reproducibility and scalability. The combined approach enables bias-reducing updates improving fairness and decision reliability in clinical predictions without central data aggregation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate and validate multiple federated EHR datasets enriched with standardized socioeconomic annotations from collaborating hospitals/public health institutions, ensuring annotated completeness and harmonization; 2) Implement automated instrument variable (IV) identification and validity testing protocols at each local site using causal discovery and sensitivity analyses tailored for federated settings; 3) Develop and integrate heterogeneity-aware causal disentanglement algorithms within federated LLM training pipelines, incorporating biologically-inspired context-aware attention mechanisms to enhance clinical vs. socioeconomic feature separation; 4) Employ privacy-preserving computation techniques (e.g., secure multiparty computation) to enable decentralized causal effect estimation; 5) Evaluate model fairness comprehensively via healthcare-tailored metrics including demographic parity, equalized odds, causal fairness measures, and out-of-distribution robustness tests; 6) Benchmark predictive performance against baseline federated LLMs lacking disentanglement; 7) Systematically assess fallback conditions where IV assumptions fail, triggering proxy adjustment models or partial centralization restricted to non-sensitive features according to predefined statistical thresholds; 8) Openly publish dataset preprocessing protocols, code, and analysis notebooks to facilitate transparency and future extension.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multisite federated EHR datasets mixing intertwined clinical signals and socioeconomic confounders with site-specific variations and noise.\nOutputs: (a) Validated instrumental variables per site and heterogeneity-aware causal effect estimates; (b) Federated LLM predictions with disentangled socioeconomic bias reduction achieving improved fairness metrics (e.g., reduced false disparities across demographics); (c) Enhanced robustness to out-of-distribution clinical cases enabled by context-aware attention, verified by stress-testing on unseen regional populations; (d) Transparent audit reports demonstrating causal assumption validity and fallback activation logs.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If instrumental variable identification or assumption verifications are inconclusive or invalid at federated sites, the system will dynamically engage fallback strategies: (1) Employ proxy variable adjustment methods that utilize strongly correlated but less causally strict socioeconomic proxies combined with domain expert constraints; (2) Allow selective partial centralization limited to aggregated non-sensitive socioeconomic feature statistics to improve confounder adjustment while preserving privacy; (3) Reweight contributions from low-IV-strength sites during federated aggregation to mitigate bias propagation; (4) Iteratively refine instrument candidate selections based on observed validation feedback; (5) Conduct targeted pilot studies to refine IV discovery and heterogeneity modeling before full-scale deployment. These adaptive decision rules are formalized as explicit thresholds and triggers within the federated update workflow to ensure method robustness and practical applicability."

          "feedback_content": "The assumption that econometric instrumental variable techniques can robustly disentangle socioeconomic confounders from clinical signals within federated LLM training is ambitious but underdeveloped in the proposal. There is limited discussion on defining valid instruments or dealing with weak or invalid instruments, which are common challenges in causal inference. Clarify feasibility and validity of these assumptions within federated settings where data distributions and confounders may vary across sites, and provide preliminary theoretical justification or pilot experiments to support the key causal assumptions before full integration in LLM training. Addressing this will strengthen the conceptual soundness and foundation of the methodology proposed in the 'Proposed_Method'. They must elaborate on how causal identification will be ensured without centralized data aggregation, considering federated heterogeneity and potential confoundersâ€™ complexity in healthcare data contexts."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan outlines relevant stages, but it lacks specifics on federated dataset availability, quality, and annotation completeness for socioeconomic variables, which are critical for realistic evaluation. The plan should explicitly discuss how to handle data heterogeneity and privacy-preserving constraints that may impact instrumental variable estimation and causal disentanglement. Also, the proposal should specify concrete metrics and benchmarks for fairness evaluations tailored to healthcare LLMs, and describe fallback strategies with clearer decision criteria. More details on the integration of econometric disentanglement into federated LLM update rules and infrastructure/software stack choices would improve practical feasibility assessment. These additions will enhance confidence in the experimental validationâ€™s robustness and real-world applicability."
