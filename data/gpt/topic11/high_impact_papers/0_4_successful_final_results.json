        "title": "Federated Human-Centered AI System Incorporating Nursing Informatics with Differential Privacy and Reinforcement Learning for Bias Reduction",
        "Problem_Statement": "Bias mitigation in healthcare large language models (LLMs) often lacks practical and transparent integration of nursing informatics and human-centered design, limiting scalability, interpretability, and trustworthiness in real-world clinical environments. Existing approaches frequently fall short in clearly defining interactive feedback mechanisms and privacy-preserving model updates, resulting in opaque fairness improvements and limited adoption by nurses.",
        "Motivation": "Despite advances in federated learning and bias mitigation, current healthcare AI systems insufficiently blend human-centered methodologies with nursing informatics data under rigorous privacy constraints. Moreover, the absence of concrete, dynamic feedback integration mechanisms with nursing experts impairs adaptive fairness refinement. Addressing these novel challenges by explicitly incorporating differential privacy techniques alongside reinforcement learning to optimize nurse-in-the-loop feedback, our approach aims to establish a reproducible, adaptable, and privacy-preserving federated AI framework. This positions the research at the convergence of human-centered design, federated learning, diagnostic decision support, and healthcare privacy—delivering superior bias mitigation and interpretability beyond existing competitive methods.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose building a federated LLM training platform that integrates nursing informatics datasets from diverse health centers with human-centered AI design. To preserve patient data privacy while enabling equitable learning, we incorporate differential privacy mechanisms guided by privacy-accuracy trade-off frameworks to protect local model updates before aggregation. The platform will implement a nurse-in-the-loop feedback system operationalized through an interactive interface where nursing experts review LLM outputs and provide structured feedback captured as reward signals. This feedback informs a reinforcement learning module that dynamically adjusts model parameters to enhance fairness and interpretability metrics iteratively. Model update protocols will rigorously document privacy budgets and fairness improvements per federated round, enabling transparent evaluation. The combined use of differential privacy, federated learning, and reinforcement learning positions the system as a robust, adaptive diagnostic decision support tool tailored to nursing practice and human-centered fairness.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Aggregate diverse nursing informatics datasets from multiple healthcare centers ensuring data heterogeneity.\n2) Develop a federated LLM training environment with integrated differential privacy controls.\n3) Design and deploy an intuitive nurse-in-the-loop interface for real-time structured feedback on LLM outputs.\n4) Implement a reinforcement learning agent that consumes nurse feedback as reward signals to iteratively refine model fairness and interpretability.\n5) Define comprehensive evaluation protocols measuring bias metrics, privacy budget adherence, interpretability scores, and nurse user acceptance.\n6) Pilot the federated system in clinical settings and monitor longitudinal impact on care equity and decision support quality,\n7) Analyze privacy-accuracy trade-offs and adapt reinforcement learning policies for optimal nurse feedback efficacy.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Free-text nursing notes capturing patient symptoms, social context, and care nuances from federated nodes.\nOutput: LLM-generated nursing recommendations that are accompanied by interpretability explanations and fairness-adjusted insights.\nFeedback: Nurses interact via an interface to provide binary and scalar feedback on fairness, relevance, and clarity; the system uses this input to update model parameters securely and transparently.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the federated learning framework encounters instability or scalability issues, we will implement a hybrid centralized-federated model allowing selective aggregation with differential privacy guarantees. To mitigate limited nurse engagement or feedback data sparsity, synthetic feedback annotations generated from expert-elicited rules will be used temporarily to bootstrap reinforcement learning. Additionally, modular design allows disabling reinforcement learning while maintaining strict privacy-preserving federated updates and nurse interface for manual monitoring."

Clarify the mechanism of feedback integration—e.g., model update protocols, interface designs, and evaluation criteria—to demonstrate a solid, reproducible method rather than a conceptual framework. This will strengthen the soundness of the approach and make it clearer how the federated system addresses bias in a human-centered manner effectively and transparently at scale, beyond asserting feedback loops exist."
