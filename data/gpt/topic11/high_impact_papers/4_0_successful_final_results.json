    "title": "Adaptive Socio-Technical Moderation Framework Using Organizational Learning and XAI Feedback Loops",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current social media moderation powered by large language models (LLMs) lacks adaptive frameworks that systematically integrate continuous organizational learning with explainable AI feedback to ensure fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics (FATE). Existing solutions suffer from static rule enforcement and opaque decision-making, impairing trust, and responsiveness to evolving societal norms.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of fragmented integration between communication/media studies and XAI and the external gap involving the underutilized application of organizational learning theories and digital leadership to drive dynamic AI governance. This approach transforms how adaptive, transparent, and human-centered moderation systems evolve by embedding learning cycles and explainability directly into AI governance frameworks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a socio-technical framework that couples LLM-driven moderation with organizational learning mechanisms. Integrate continuous feedback loops from moderators and community stakeholders via explainable AI modules that provide interpretable rationales (leveraging LIME and SHAP) for moderation decisions. Design digital leadership protocols that use this feedback to update moderation policies dynamically. Employ hybrid models combining reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with organizational change management processes to iteratively adjust AI behavior and governance rules in an accountable and transparent manner.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect moderated social media datasets across evolving policy periods. 2. Implement baseline LLM moderation with static policies. 3. Develop the proposed adaptive framework with integrated XAI explanations and organizational learning feedback loops. 4. Evaluate improvements via metrics on fairness (demographic parity, equality of opportunity), accountability (auditability scores), transparency (explanation fidelity), and ethics (bias metrics). 5. Conduct user studies with moderators assessing trust and usability. 6. Compare dynamic vs. static governance impacts on moderation quality and organizational responsiveness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User posts a borderline hate speech content on a platform. The LLM provides a moderation decision with an explanation (e.g., highlighting specific phrases triggering hate speech flags). Feedback from moderators disagrees with the decision and provides contextual insight. The system logs this input and adjusts the moderation criteria in the next update cycle, reducing false positives and improving fairness.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time adaptation is unstable, implement batched policy updates using periodic organizational review panels aggregating moderated feedback. Alternatively, focus on enhancing explanation quality as a first step before incorporating organizational learning loops fully."

        "title": "Adaptive Socio-Technical Moderation Framework Using Organizational Learning and Explainable AI Feedback Loops Across Domains",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current automated content moderation systems, particularly those based on large language models (LLMs), remain largely static and domain-specific, lacking adaptive socio-technical frameworks that systematically integrate continuous organizational learning with explainable AI (XAI) feedback to ensure fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics (FATE). This limitation results in opaque decision-making and poor responsiveness to evolving societal, clinical, and educational norms, which undermines user trust and system effectiveness not only in social media but also in other sensitive content governance settings such as healthcare information filtering and educational material moderation. There is a critical need for a generalizable, adaptable, and human-centered governance framework that bridges AI capabilities with organizational learning and digital leadership practices to transparently and dynamically govern complex socio-technical systems dealing with sensitive information and ethical considerations.",
        "Motivation": "Existing work demonstrates fragmented integration among communication/media studies, XAI, and organizational learning, often limited to social media moderation. This results in systems that cannot adapt well to shifting policy landscapes or cross-domain governance challenges. Our research addresses these gaps by advancing a novel interdisciplinary framework that tightly couples organizational learning theories, digital leadership, and state-of-the-art XAI methods within governance mechanisms. By explicitly targeting generalization beyond social media moderation to domains like healthcare and education, and embedding measurable mechanisms of feedback collection, governance adaptation, and evaluation, this approach represents a significant advancement over static or narrowly scoped solutions. Furthermore, we incorporate key global challenges centered on AI fairness, ethical decision-making, and human-centered AI to ensure broad societal impact and technical novelty, thus overcoming the initial evaluation’s competitive novelty concerns through comprehensive interdisciplinarity and operational rigor.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular and extensible socio-technical framework that combines LLM-driven decision models with explicit organizational learning mechanisms and explainable AI (XAI) feedback loops. Our method involves: (1) Implementing domain-agnostic, interpretable AI modules leveraging state-of-the-art XAI techniques (such as enhanced LIME, SHAP, and counterfactual explanations) to provide actionable rationales for AI decisions across social media, healthcare information filtering, and educational content moderation. (2) Designing concrete feedback instrumentation tools—digital dashboards and annotation interfaces—that systematically collect structured quantitative (e.g., moderator disagreement rates) and qualitative (e.g., context notes) data from diverse stakeholders, including moderators, domain experts, patients, educators, and learners. (3) Developing digital leadership protocols formalized as governance adaptation workflows with defined update schedules (e.g., biweekly policy revisitation) and clear criteria (statistical triggers such as shifts in fairness metrics or auditability thresholds) that govern model and policy updates. (4) Integrating reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) guided by organizational change management principles to iteratively refine AI behaviors and rules in a transparent, accountable manner. (5) Embedding privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored for resource-constrained edge environments to support sensitive healthcare and educational data contexts. This approach fosters human-centered AI practices and scalability across complex socio-technical systems.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Collection: Compile moderated datasets across multiple domains—social media hate speech, healthcare misinformation filtering, and educational content quality control—capturing temporal policy shifts and multi-stakeholder feedback. 2. Baseline Implementation: Deploy static LLM moderation models with fixed policies for each domain. 3. Feedback Instrumentation: Develop and deploy digital feedback tools to enable structured collection of moderator, expert, and user feedback, including quantitative disagreement rates, contextual qualitative notes, and trust usability questionnaires. 4. Governance Adaptation Protocol Design: Formalize digital leadership update workflows specifying periodic policy review cycles, measurable criteria for adaptation (e.g., demographic parity violation thresholds, audit scores), and documented decision authority hierarchies. 5. Develop Adaptive Framework: Integrate XAI explanations and organizational learning cycles with RLHF-based dynamic updates utilizing collected feedback and governance protocols. 6. Holistic Evaluation: Assess improvements using AI performance metrics (fairness — demographic parity, equality of opportunity; transparency — explanation fidelity and user comprehension scores; ethics — bias reduction metrics), alongside organizational learning indicators (rate and consistency of policy adaptations, feedback incorporation latency) and leadership effectiveness measures (stakeholder satisfaction, trust, decision audibility). 7. User Studies: Conduct cross-domain moderator and stakeholder usability, trust, and acceptance evaluations including qualitative interviews and surveys. 8. Comparative Analysis: Compare static vs. adaptive governance impact on moderation quality, organizational responsiveness, and cross-domain generalization to demonstrate scalability and robustness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1 (Social Media): User posts borderline hate speech. The LLM outputs a moderation decision with an interpretable explanation highlighting specific flagged phrases. Moderator feedback collected via digital dashboard disagrees, providing contextual notes. System logs and aggregates this input. Upon periodic review, governance workflows trigger policy updates, reducing false positives and improving fairness. Example 2 (Healthcare): A patient forum post containing ambiguous medical advice is flagged by the AI with high uncertainty. Healthcare professionals provide structured feedback disagreeing with the AI classification, with contextual clinical rationale documented. Feedback instruments capture this information, triggering governance review and policy refinement guided by ethical decision-making principles and privacy constraints for sensitive data. Example 3 (Education): Automated moderation flags educational content as inappropriate due to nuanced language usage. Teachers provide qualitative feedback and learner outcome data. The system integrates this multi-source input through organizational learning cycles, refining moderation criteria to balance educational quality and inclusivity while maintaining transparency through XAI explanations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time adaptive updates prove unstable or infeasible, we will implement a rigorous batched update process leveraging scheduled organizational review panels that systematically aggregate and analyze moderator and stakeholder feedback for policy refinement. Concurrently, focus will shift towards enhancing the quality, comprehensibility, and domain applicability of AI explanations to strengthen trust and user engagement as preparatory groundwork for full organizational learning integration. Privacy-preserving mechanisms and domain-specific customization will be incrementally introduced to ensure compliance and practical deployment in sensitive environments. This phased approach ensures steady progress, mitigating technical risks while maintaining impact momentum and stakeholder alignment."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan, while comprehensive, lacks specificity regarding how the organizational learning mechanisms and digital leadership protocols will be operationalized, measured, and validated in practice. For example, the plan does not clarify how feedback from moderators and community stakeholders will be systematically collected, aggregated, and incorporated into model updates beyond high-level descriptions. This vagueness introduces risk for feasibility and reproducibility, especially given the complex socio-technical interactions involved. Strengthening this section with concrete designs for feedback instrumentation, update schedules, and measurable governance adaptation criteria will improve clarity and practical executability of the approach, increasing confidence that the method can be meaningfully evaluated and iterated upon in real-world conditions. Consider also clearly defining metrics or qualitative indicators for the organizational learning cycle and leadership effectiveness alongside AI performance metrics for a holistic assessment framework that aligns tightly with the proposed interdisciplinary integration goals. This refinement is crucial for convincing reviewers and stakeholders of the feasibility and scientific rigor of the proposed evaluation methodology in this ambitious research space, where bridging social science and AI system experimentation is notoriously challenging yet essential for impact success and adoption potential in governance contexts. Target Section: Experiment_Plan; Feedback Code: FEA-EXPERIMENT. Impact: IMP-BROADEN_IMPACT. Suggestion: SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION. Please note only the top two critiques are reported here per instructions. The above expands the top critique with a strong focus on feasibility and impact applicability to ground the innovation more solidly in experimental design and evaluation rigor. The next critique is provided following this one for balanced coverage of soundness and impact scope considerations without overwhelming focus on minor details first."

          "feedback_code": "IMP-BROADEN_IMPACT",
          "feedback_content": "While the research tackles critical social media moderation challenges integrating explainability and organizational learning, its framing and test cases remain narrowly scoped around moderation of hate speech and policy adjustment feedback within social media platforms. The project could broaden its impact and novelty by more explicitly targeting generalization beyond social media moderation—for example, applying the adaptive socio-technical framework to other domains involving sensitive content governance or complex human-AI decision-making environments such as healthcare information filtering, educational content moderation, or privacy-sensitive IoT device communication management. This cross-domain framing would better emphasize the transformative potential and scalability of the proposed framework, increasing appeal to a larger audience and funding bodies. Additionally, linking the work more concretely with globally relevant concerns like AI fairness, ethical decision-making, and human-centered AI (from your linked concepts) would ground the proposal in central interdisciplinary challenges with widespread research and societal interest. Expanded framing and example scenarios beyond hate speech detection will help position this research to not only advance social media governance but also serve as a generalizable model for adaptive, transparent AI governance in various complex, socio-technical systems that require trust and continual learning from diverse stakeholders.
