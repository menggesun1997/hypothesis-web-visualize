    "title": "Adaptive Cognitive Explanation Interfaces for Legal Stakeholders",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM explainability approaches for legal text analysis provide generic explanations that fail to account for the diverse cognitive models and expertise levels of stakeholders such as judges, lawyers, and litigants. This one-size-fits-all method undermines trust and interpretability in high-stakes legal environments.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient tailored explainability for domain-specific contexts by integrating cognitive psychology insights and user-centered design. Leverages Opportunity 1 from the landscape to move beyond generic explanations towards adaptive, stakeholder-specific explainability interfaces, enhancing trust and usability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a framework combining cognitive user modeling with adaptive explanation generation. First, create cognitive profiles for different legal stakeholders capturing their domain knowledge, cognitive load capacity, and decision contexts. Then, use these profiles to parameterize an LLM-based explanation engine that dynamically adjusts explanation complexity, terminology, and presentation style. Implement an interactive interface allowing stakeholders to query further clarifications or view explanation depth layers, guided by cognitive load theory principles. The architecture integrates psycholinguistic metrics, legal ontology embeddings, and attention-based explanation modules generating tailored narratives.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multi-stakeholder datasets comprising legal documents and explanation preferences via surveys and interviews.\n2) Develop cognitive user profiles and annotate explanation requirements.\n3) Fine-tune an LLM to generate explanations adaptable by these profiles.\n4) Compare to generic baseline LLM explanations using user satisfaction, trust scales, and cognitive load measures.\n5) Run A/B tests with judges, lawyers, and lay users.\n6) Evaluate interpretability via comprehension tests and decision accuracy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Contract clause regarding breach liabilities.\nExpected Output: \n- For a judge: Detailed legal grounds citing precedents with formal terminology.\n- For a lay litigant: Simplified explanation with everyday language and analogies.\n- For a lawyer: Technical explanation with citations and procedural implications.\nInteractive clarifications let users dive deeper or summon examples as needed.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If user modeling data is insufficient, begin with a rule-based persona segmentation approach. Alternatively, implement a semi-supervised clustering of stakeholder explanation preferences. If adaptive explanations prove too complex, fall back to multi-layered static explanation tiers selectable by the user."

          "feedback_content": "While the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is methodologically sound and includes relevant metrics (user satisfaction, trust scales, cognitive load), it relies heavily on collecting detailed multi-stakeholder explanation preferences through surveys and interviews. Given the challenges in recruiting judges and legal professionals, and capturing reliable cognitive profile data, this approach may face significant practical bottlenecks. The plan should explicitly address potential difficulties in data collection, propose strategies for securing representative stakeholder participation, and include contingency protocols beyond the proposed fallback plan to validate cognitive profiles. Additionally, metrics for evaluating the fidelity of the cognitive user models and their actual influence on explanation quality are currently under-specified and should be integrated to ensure experimental rigor and feasibility in high-stakes real-world environments. This enhancement will better establish the plan’s scientific and practical viability at scale within legal contexts, which can be notoriously difficult to access and model accurately due to domain complexity and sensitivity of data.

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty pre-screening view that this work is NOV-COMPETITIVE and involves adaptive explanation in a legal context, a valuable enhancement would be to explicitly integrate and evaluate conceptual models of trust from human-centered AI and human-computer interaction literature. By incorporating trust-building mechanisms beyond cognitive user modeling—such as interactive trust calibration feedback loops, transparency metrics, and model-of-trust frameworks—this research can systematically elevate stakeholder confidence in LLM-generated explanations. Leveraging insights from 'human-AI teams', 'user-centered design', and 'model of trust' can concretely differentiate the contribution and broaden its interdisciplinary impact beyond purely technical adaptation. Additionally, connecting to intelligent app design principles could facilitate broader deployment pathways in legal informatics, enhancing both interpretability and acceptability in practice. This integration would create a more holistic framework that addresses social and cognitive dimensions of explainability critical for high-stakes, policy-relevant AI applications.
