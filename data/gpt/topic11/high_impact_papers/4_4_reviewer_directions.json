    "title": "Systematic Integration Framework for Explainability in Organizational Digital Transformation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Despite significant research on explainable AI (XAI) and organizational digital transformation, there is a lack of systematic methods integrating explainability seamlessly within complex organizational change processes, weakening ethical AI deployments.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap highlighting limited integration of explainability into organizational digital transformation frameworks. This project innovates by codifying processes that embed XAI into every stage of organizational change for AI governance, fostering ethical compliance and stakeholder alignment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-phase integration framework that maps organizational transformation milestones (e.g., strategy, training, operationalization) onto explainability deliverables (e.g., interpretability reports, transparency dashboards, ethical impact assessments). Design toolkits and templates for stakeholders at each phase to incorporate explainability artifacts using communication research principles and change management best practices.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Analyze existing case studies of AI digital transformation. 2. Identify key inflection points for explainability interventions. 3. Develop prototype toolkits and templates. 4. Partner with organizations to apply and refine the framework. 5. Evaluate impact on ethical compliance metrics, employee understanding, and trust levels via surveys and performance indicators.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An organization undergoing AI moderation tool deployment uses the framework to schedule transparent reporting and ethical impact reviews alongside staff training. Outcome: higher employee trust scores and policy adherence.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If broad integration is difficult, focus initially on critical phases such as training or policy updates with concentrated explainability efforts. Alternatively, develop modular explainability components that organizations can adopt incrementally."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a multi-phase integration framework mapping organizational milestones to explainability deliverables, which is conceptually sound but lacks sufficient detail about how these mappings will be operationalized and validated within diverse organizational contexts. Specifically, the mechanism for translating communication research principles and change management best practices into practical toolkits and templates is not fully elaborated, raising concerns about replicability and effectiveness. Providing more concrete descriptions or initial design rationale for these toolkits, including how stakeholder engagement and feedback loops will be incorporated, will improve the clarity and credibility of the method’s internal logic and practical applicability, especially given organizational complexity and variability in digital transformation maturity levels. Strengthening the articulation of this mechanism is necessary to build confidence in the solution’s soundness and utility beyond theoretical alignment risks. This must be a priority before experimental evaluation begins, as it will directly affect usability and impact measurements, including ethical compliance and trust metrics."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment, to enhance both impact and differentiation, integrate the framework explicitly with emerging global policy and regulatory frameworks around AI ethics and management, such as the AI Act. Concrete linking of explainability deliverables with compliance checkpoints in AI governance regulation can increase relevance and adoption in public and private sectors. Additionally, explore synergies with human-centered design approaches and e-government services to make the framework applicable for digitally transforming public sector organizations where trust, transparency, and ethical compliance are paramount. Embedding how explainability artefacts support broader data life cycle governance and stakeholder engagement strategies in these globally-relevant domains would not only broaden the scope but also position the work at the intersection of critical and current challenges. This will improve competitiveness in a crowded field by explicitly addressing regulatory-driven needs and practical applications aligned with internationally emerging standards."
