    "title": "LLMs Embedded with Social Determinants of Health for Equitable Clinical Predictions",
    "Problem_Statement": "Healthcare LLMs inadequately model social determinants of health (SDOH), leading to biased predictions that exacerbate healthcare disparities.",
    "Motivation": "Targets external gap of integrating public health concepts with human-centered AI and LLMs (Opportunity 2), proposing context-sensitive models to reduce bias linked to underserved populations.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a contextual embedding framework that explicitly encodes SDOH features (e.g., income, education, neighborhood) into LLM input layers for clinical prediction tasks. Use multi-modal input combining structured EHR and unstructured clinical notes enriched with SDOH tags. Train with adversarial bias mitigation conditioned on sensitive group membership and SDOH contexts to encourage invariant, fair representations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect EHR datasets with annotated SDOH info.\n2) Train baseline LLMs on clinical outcome prediction.\n3) Inject SDOH embedding layers and implement adversarial debiasing.\n4) Compare fairness metrics such as disparate impact and equalized odds.\n5) Evaluate clinical utility via ROC-AUC and calibration.\n6) Conduct user studies to validate enhanced equity and interpretability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient clinical notes plus encoded SDOH attributes indicating low socioeconomic status.\nOutput: Equitably adjusted risk score prediction with reduced bias against low-SES groups and rationale highlighting influential social factors.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If SDOH embeddings underperform, try curriculum learning to progressively incorporate SDOH or augment with domain adaptation techniques from public health datasets."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan lacks clarity on the availability and quality of EHR datasets with annotated social determinants of health (SDOH) data, which is critical for training and evaluation. Since accurate SDOH annotation is often sparse or inconsistent in real-world clinical data, the proposal should include detailed data sourcing strategies, validation protocols for SDOH annotations, and a risk mitigation plan if such datasets are limited. Additionally, the user studies to validate equity and interpretability require concrete design considerations to ensure statistically meaningful and unbiased feedback from diverse stakeholders. Enhancing the experiment plan with these specifics will improve feasibility and robustness of the approach, enabling credible evaluation of the fairness claims in clinical settings. This is vital before advancing to complex adversarial debiasing frameworks embedded in LLMs, which demand high-quality multimodal inputs and rigorous validation setups to confirm impact and fairness improvements at scale.  Targeted recommendations: explicitly identify accessible datasets or outline partnerships for acquiring SDOH annotations; define annotation quality criteria and validation steps; sketch detailed user study protocols, including participant diversity, study design, and evaluation metrics for interpretability and equity assessment.  This refinement is essential for proving the concept's practical viability and reproducibility in realistic healthcare environments.  The feedback targets the 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' section for enhancing scientific rigor and practical readiness of the experimental evaluation framework.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "To elevate both the novelty and impact of this research in a competitive space, I recommend integrating domain insights from 'nurse practitioners' perceptions' and 'nursing documentation' within the SDOH embedding and modeling framework. Including nurse-generated data and perspectives can enrich the social context representation beyond structured EHR fields and clinical notes, providing more granular, interpretive, and contextual social determinants relevant at the frontline of patient care. For example, extracting and embedding nuances of social and environmental factors documented or perceived by nurse practitioners could improve model contextualization and fairness, making the clinical risk prediction more aligned with real-world care delivery. Moreover, incorporating such data aligns well with the patient-centered model of care and may enhance interpretability and acceptance of the model recommendations among healthcare workers. To operationalize, consider collaborating with healthcare institutions to access nursing notes and conduct qualitative elicitation studies on SDOH from nurses, then encode these social inputs as part of the multi-modal embedding layers. This approach leverages globally linked concepts in a concrete manner, strengthens interdisciplinary bonds across data-driven ML and human-centered care, and differentiates the research agenda, potentially increasing both societal impact and competitive edge. This suggestion targets the overall conceptual integration and method augmentation to broaden scope and enhance practical relevance and novelty in the 'Proposed_Method' and 'Motivation' sections."
