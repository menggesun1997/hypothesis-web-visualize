        "title": "EcoXAI+: Scalable, Distributed, and Data-Driven Environmental Transparency for LLM Training",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current AI training pipelines for large language models (LLMs) lack integrated, scalable, and interpretable tools that provide real-time insights on environmental impact across diverse hardware and distributed training setups, limiting practitioners' ability to understand and reduce ecological footprints effectively.",
        "Motivation": "While prior efforts aim to monitor environmental impact during LLM training, they often rely on specialized hardware sensors or isolated post-hoc analyses, restricting scalability and practical deployment in cloud-based or multi-node distributed environments. EcoXAI+ pioneers an integrated, scalable framework that blends explainable AI (XAI) interpretability with distributed computing and big data analytics. This approach bridges the gap between environmental transparency and large-scale, real-world LLM training pipelines by enabling real-time, interpretable feedback aggregated across heterogeneous infrastructures. By capitalizing on data-driven innovation and evolutionary computation techniques, EcoXAI+ empowers adaptive optimization of performance and ecological trade-offs, positioning itself as a significantly novel and impactful tool in sustainable AI development.",
        "Proposed_Method": "EcoXAI+ is a modular, distributed software ecosystem designed to monitor, explain, and optimize the environmental footprint of LLM training at scale. It integrates multiple data sources: lightweight hardware telemetry (when available), system logs, workload estimations, and cloud provider metrics to create resilient and scalable environmental proxies without exclusive dependence on specialized sensors. Leveraging distributed computing principles, EcoXAI+ collects and aggregates environmental and performance data across federated training nodes with minimal overhead using asynchronous protocols. Its core incorporates big data analytics and graph neural networks to model complex interactions among architectural choices, hyperparameters, and environmental impact over multiple training runs and configurations. For interpretability, EcoXAI+ implements layered XAI visualizations and evolutionary computation optimizers that dynamically propose Pareto-efficient trade-offs between energy consumption and model accuracy. The dashboard supports cross-run multi-dimensional analysis and actionable recommendations, enabling practitioners to adapt training pipelines in real-time or batch scenarios. Integration with standard ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) and cloud APIs ensures wide applicability across diverse infrastructures.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Prototype EcoXAI+ components on small-scale setups, combining hardware sensor telemetry with system logs and workload-based energy estimations to validate data fusion and measurement fidelity.\n2. Develop and benchmark distributed data collection and aggregation protocols in simulated multi-node environments to ensure low overhead and scalability with federated training architectures.\n3. Design and train interpretable graph-based models to capture correlations between training configurations and environmental metrics using collected big data from multiple runs.\n4. Integrate evolutionary optimization algorithms for automatic tuning of energy-performance trade-offs, evaluated on benchmark NLP models (e.g., BERT, GPT-2) across varying cluster and cloud settings.\n5. Develop a rich dashboard that visualizes environmental impact at node and cluster levels with explainable insights and optimization suggestions.\n6. Conduct user studies with ML practitioners to assess interpretability, usability, and impact of EcoXAI+ on training decisions compared to baseline post-hoc reporting tools.\n7. Deploy and evaluate EcoXAI+ on diverse hardware and cloud platforms, analyzing robustness under noisy or incomplete data conditions and validating fallback mechanisms employing proxy metrics and simpler interpretability surrogates.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Initiate distributed training of GPT-2 with EcoXAI+ enabled across a hybrid cloud and on-premise cluster.\nOutput: The EcoXAI+ dashboard dynamically aggregates environmental data from heterogeneous nodes, showing interpretable graphs linking batch size, sequence length, and optimizer parameters to spikes in carbon emissions. Evolutionary computed recommendations suggest a configuration that reduces overall power consumption by 15% with less than 1% accuracy degradation. Users observe cross-run environmental trends and validate optimization impact before applying live changes.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If specialized hardware telemetry is unavailable or unreliable, EcoXAI+ will prioritize alternate data sources such as system logs, cloud provider energy estimates, and workload modeling to maintain environmental impact monitoring. Measurement noise is mitigated via data smoothing and uncertainty quantification techniques within the analytics pipeline. For scenarios with limited distributed infrastructure access, EcoXAI+ supports single-node approximations with reduced granularity and offline batch analyses. If complex interpretability and optimization models prove too resource-intensive or incomprehensible to users, the system can fallback to simpler surrogate models and static rule-based recommendations derived from empirical studies. Continuous validation and benchmarking against post-hoc approaches ensure robustness and progress without overreliance on any single data modality or algorithmic component."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan relies heavily on specialized hardware sensors and system metrics to collect environmental data during large-scale LLM training. This raises concerns regarding feasibility, as procuring, calibrating, and integrating such sensors with existing ML infrastructure (e.g., cloud environments or distributed training) can be non-trivial and might limit broader applicability. Additionally, real-time data collection at the scale of models like GPT-2 or BERT may introduce overhead or noise affecting training or measurement accuracy. It is recommended to elaborate on how hardware integration challenges, measurement noise, and system overhead will be addressed and to explore scalable simulation or proxy metrics that do not rely exclusively on specialized sensors to ensure practicality and broader adoption in diverse training settings, including distributed and cloud-based environments. This clarification would strengthen the experimental design’s scientific soundness and practical feasibility to realize EcoXAI effectively in real-world scenarios and large-scale systems environments with varied hardware setups and deployment constraints. Targets to expand and specify fallback strategies in concrete terms beyond the high-level fallback plan would also be beneficial for robustness and success of evaluation steps in realistic conditions where sensor data access might be limited or noisy, to avoid disruptions to research progress and evaluation completeness.  Consider benchmarking initial prototypes on smaller scale setups to validate data fidelity and real-time feedback mechanisms before scaling. Moreover, including alternative data sources such as workload method-based estimations or system logs as complementary inputs can improve resilience of the approach under practical deployment constraints. Overall, enhancing the experiment plan with these practical considerations and contingencies will improve feasibility assessment and project viability confidence significantly.  \n\n---\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the interdisciplinary nature involving environmental metrics, XAI, and LLM training, there is a strong opportunity to leverage linked concepts such as 'distributed computing' and 'big data analytics' to broaden and deepen EcoXAI’s novelty and impact. For example, integrating techniques from distributed computing can enable EcoXAI to efficiently aggregate environmental data and interpretability signals across multi-node or federated training architectures, which are increasingly common in LLM training pipelines. This could augment EcoXAI’s scalability and applicability in contemporary large-scale AI development contexts. Furthermore, coupling with 'big data analytics' methods can facilitate more sophisticated, data-driven modeling of environmental impact patterns and emergent trade-offs across multiple training runs and model variants, enabling practitioners to discover deeper insights beyond single-training-session dashboards. Such integration can also help in applying evolutionary computation or optimization methods (linked concept) for automated energy-model trade-off tuning based on real-time feedback. By explicitly tying the EcoXAI framework to these advanced fields, the project can transcend being a specialized tool and position itself as part of a larger paradigm of sustainable, data-driven AI development workflows, thus greatly enhancing its appeal, adoption potential, and research contribution to the AI and environmental sustainability communities. Including this direction in the revision would strengthen the paper’s contribution and originality claims amidst a competitive landscape. "
