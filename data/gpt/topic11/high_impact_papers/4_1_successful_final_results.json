    "title": "Transparent Interactive Moderation Dashboards Leveraging Advanced XAI and Human-Centered UI Design",
    "Problem_Statement": "Social media moderators and users often face black-box AI moderation decisions, resulting in low trust, misunderstandings, and reduced acceptance of automated moderation. Current explainability tools are fragmented and lack integration with UI designs tailored for diverse user expertise.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap in integrating communication research and XAI via advanced algorithms and UI design to create truly transparent, user-friendly moderation tools. This bridges practical deficits in explainability and accountability by making AI decisions accessible and interactive, improving transparency and trustworthiness.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an interactive moderation dashboard combining state-of-the-art local explainability methods (e.g., LIME, counterfactual explanations) with adaptive UI elements customized for moderator expertise and user roles. Incorporate multi-modal outputs (text highlights, visual graphs, actionable suggestions) that explain the rationale behind each moderation decision. Implement feedback mechanisms for moderators and users to query, contest, and understand AI decisions, fostering co-learning between human and AI agents.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Design and develop the interactive dashboard prototype. 2. Integrate LLM-based moderation systems with embedded XAI modules. 3. Recruit moderators and user participants for scenario-based testing. 4. Measure usability via SUS score, as well as trust and transparency via validated questionnaires. 5. Compare decision accuracy and acceptance rates before and after dashboard introduction. 6. Analyze interaction logs to refine explainability methods and UI flow.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A flagged sarcastic post that the AI classifies as harmful speech. The dashboard highlights sarcastic markers and explains classification uncertainty. The moderator interacts with the interface to review alternative interpretations and can override the decision. User feedback is recorded to improve future moderation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If complexity overwhelms users, simplify dashboards by prioritizing core explanations and offering advanced details on-demand. Alternatively, replace some interactive features with video or chatbot-based explanations to better suit user preferences."

        "title": "Adaptive Sociotechnical Moderation Dashboards Integrating Advanced XAI with Learner-Driven Human-AI Interaction Design",
        "Problem_Statement": "Social media moderators and users frequently encounter opaque, black-box AI moderation outputs that undermine trust, cause misunderstandings, and reduce acceptance of automated decisions. Existing explainability tools are fragmented, predominantly static, and lack integration with user interfaces that dynamically adapt to diverse moderator expertise and evolving community needs within complex sociotechnical moderation environments.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work explores AI explainability and UI design in moderation, these efforts often fail to contextualize explainability within a dynamic sociotechnical system that accommodates human-AI co-learning, model risk management, and evolving trust relationships. Addressing the NOV-COMPETITIVE landscape, this project advances the state-of-the-art by embedding adaptive, learner-model-driven interfaces informed by continuous user interaction analytics to close sociotechnical gaps. It aligns with Responsible Artificial Intelligence principles by ensuring transparency, fairness, accountability, and community-centered governance within moderation workflows, thereby increasing practical impact and novelty through systemic human-AI collaboration frameworks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel, adaptive interactive moderation dashboard that integrates local XAI techniques (e.g., counterfactual explanations, attribution highlights) with a dynamic learner model capturing individual and community-level moderator expertise, trust metrics, and feedback behaviors. This system will incorporate multi-modal, context-aware explanation outputs—textual, visual, and actionable suggestions—customized in real time via interface adaptation algorithms grounded in human-computer interaction research. Interaction logs and user behavior analytics will feed continuous refinement loops enabling co-learning between AI and human agents. The dashboard will embed sociotechnical system design principles to manage model risk dynamically, support contestation mechanisms, and promote a learner-driven AI ecosystem, thus advancing intelligent environment creation for moderation scenarios. This approach transcends static explainability by situating AI interpretation within evolving human-AI interaction and trust-building processes, addressing complex phenomena such as sarcasm, ambiguity, and community norms.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Conduct a technical validation phase to rigorously assess and calibrate XAI outputs integrated with LLM-based moderation systems using benchmark moderation datasets emphasizing nuanced content (e.g., sarcasm, ambiguous speech). Metrics will include explanation fidelity, consistency, and relevance as quantified by established XAI evaluation frameworks.\n2. Develop a learner model framework to capture moderator expertise, trust evolution, and feedback patterns through behavioral analytics embedded in the dashboard.\n3. Implement iterative pilot studies with a carefully curated participant pool reflecting a diversity of moderator expertise levels and user demographics to evaluate usability, trust, transparency, and acceptance. Recruitment criteria will include professional experience variation, demographic diversity, and prior AI interaction familiarity to ensure generalizability.\n4. Utilize validated quantitative metrics such as System Usability Scale (SUS) with predefined success thresholds (e.g., SUS > 70), alongside bespoke trust and transparency questionnaires with clear, operationalized learning objectives.\n5. Perform qualitative analyses from focus groups and interaction log reviews to iteratively refine UI adaptation strategies and explainability modalities.\n6. Scale up to a comparative controlled study evaluating decision accuracy, acceptance rates, and co-learning effects before and after dashboard introduction.\n7. Data-driven risk management assessments will be conducted continuously to ensure the system reliably supports moderators without overwhelming cognitive load.\nThis staged approach ensures system readiness, feasibility, and operational relevance with explicit success criteria guiding progression.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A flagged sarcastic social media post assessed by the LLM-based system as harmful speech with classification uncertainty.\nDashboard Behavior: Highlights sarcastic linguistic markers and displays confidence intervals within explanations.\nAdaptive UI customizes explanation depth based on moderator expertise and prior interaction patterns.\nModerator explores alternative interpretations via interactive counterfactual queries, with the learner model updating trust scores accordingly.\nModerator decides to override or uphold the AI decision; feedback triggers system refinement in real time.\nResults and feedback are aggregated at a community level enabling adaptive interface adjustments benefiting the moderator group.\nThis test case exemplifies handling nuances and demonstrates co-learning and evolving sociotechnical interaction.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should user complexity become a barrier, the system will employ progressive disclosure to prioritize core explanations while relegating advanced details to on-demand layers, preserving transparency without overload. Alternative modalities such as conversational chatbots or short, contextual tutorial videos explaining AI rationale will be integrated to accommodate user preferences. Additionally, if iterative pilots reveal challenges with learner model adaptability, we will adopt hybrid static-dynamic interface designs allowing manual user customization alongside adaptive features, thereby balancing flexibility and usability. This tiered fallback strategy ensures operational robustness without sacrificing system goals."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experimental plan is well-structured but lacks clarity on how the integration of the LLM-based moderation system with embedded XAI modules will be validated before user testing. It is important to include preliminary technical validation steps to ensure the explainability outputs are reliable and meaningful in realistic moderation contexts. Additionally, more detail is needed on participant recruitment criteria regarding moderator expertise diversity and user representation to support generalizability of usability and trust measurements. Expanding on these aspects will improve feasibility and robustness of the evaluation framework, ensuring that subsequent usability and impact assessments are grounded on a technically sound system and a representative user sample. Consider also planning iterative development cycles allowing refinement based on early feedback logs before the formal comparative study phase to better ensure system readiness and incremental improvement effectiveness in real-world moderation scenarios, which are typically complex and variable in nature. This will boost confidence in the feasibility and practical applicability of the approach overall, reducing risk of experimental failure due to premature large-scale testing with immature prototypes or unrepresentative user bases. Suggest adding technical validation and iterative pilot study steps explicitly to the experiment plan to enhance feasibility and scientific rigor of the proposed research trajectory.\n\nFurther, explicitly defining quantitative and qualitative criteria for success in the SUS, trust, transparency, decision accuracy, and acceptance rate measurements would improve rigor and clarity of the plan and its ability to provide actionable learnings for future development and deployment of such explainability dashboards in moderation workflows, addressing the real-world complexity moderators face when dealing with nuanced content such as sarcasm or ambiguity, highlighted in the test cases provided.\n\nSummary: include technical validation, clearer participant criteria, iterative pilots, and well-defined success metrics before large-scale user testing to enhance feasibility and reliability of findings in a competitive, real-world relevant domain. This will increase the chance of producing scientifically valid and operationally useful results from the proposed experiments.\n\n[FEA-EXPERIMENT]"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE assessment and the proposal's focus on advanced XAI combined with human-centered UI design for moderation, a key opportunity lies in explicitly integrating concepts from 'human-AI interaction design', 'sociotechnical gaps', and 'Responsible Artificial Intelligence' to strengthen both novelty and impact. Specifically, the proposal could be enhanced by framing the dashboard as part of a sociotechnical system that not only explains AI decisions but dynamically adapts to evolving moderator and user needs through a learner model that captures individual and community-level trust, expertise, and feedback patterns.\n\nThis would position the work within human-centered AI frameworks emphasizing co-learning and model risk management, moving beyond local explainability towards a systemic, interactive intelligence environment for content moderation. Incorporating adaptive interface adaptation informed by continuous interaction logs and user behavior analytics would differentiate the approach in a competitive area and address broader socio-technical challenges around fairness, transparency, and accountability in online moderation, mapping directly to 'Responsible Artificial Intelligence' and 'human-AI interaction research'.\n\nRecommendation: embed adaptive, learner-driven interaction design principles from 'human-computer interaction research' and 'design of intelligent environments' to create a feedback-loop moderated explainability ecosystem that evolves transparently with community trust and risk mitigation goals. This global integration will boost research novelty, practical relevance, and downstream impact by addressing multilayered human-AI collaboration complexities in content moderation—a phenomenon of global interest.\n\nSuch an approach could also connect to related domains like 'detecting disinformation' and safeguarding 'non-technical end users', thereby broadening the impact scope and aligning with emerging challenges in intelligent environments and AI frameworks.\n\n[SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION]"
