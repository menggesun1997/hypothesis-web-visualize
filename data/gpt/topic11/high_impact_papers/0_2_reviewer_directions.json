    "title": "NLP-Driven Interpretability Layer for Clinical Decision Support LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs used in healthcare lack sufficient transparency and interpretability, undermining trust and safe adoption in clinical decisions.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gap of low interpretability and trust by leveraging advanced NLP and clinical decision support concepts from Opportunity 3, shifting beyond black-box models to explainable outputs tailored to healthcare professionals.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an NLP interpretability module integrating named entity recognition, causality extraction, and rationale generation aligned with clinical decision processes. The system will produce user-friendly, evidence-backed explanations for LLM predictions, linked with clinical guidelines and patient-specific data. This module works as an interactive interface emphasizing transparency and accountable AI.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Use clinical datasets annotated for entities and causality.\n2) Train base LLMs for clinical prediction.\n3) Develop and integrate the interpretability layer producing natural language rationales.\n4) Evaluate explanation quality via metrics such as BLEU, faithfulness, and clinician ratings.\n5) Test impact on clinician decision confidence and error reduction.\n6) Conduct simulated deployment studies for usability and safety assessment.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical note describing symptoms and lab results.\nOutput: Prediction of diagnosis with stepwise rationale describing symptom relevance and citing clinical guidelines, improving clinician acceptance.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If generated explanations lack fidelity, fallback to rule-based explanation templates or hybrid symbolic-NLP approaches to enforce medically grounded rationale."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while comprehensive, lacks detail on how the interpretability module’s outputs will be quantitatively and qualitatively validated for clinical relevance beyond standard NLP metrics (e.g., BLEU) and clinician ratings. Specifically, the plan should clarify how causality extraction and rationale generation will be operationalized and benchmarked against existing clinical decision support interpretability methods. Furthermore, it is unclear how patient-specific data and clinical guidelines integration will be standardized and verified to ensure fidelity and safety in real clinical scenarios, which is crucial for feasibility and deployment. Addressing these points by defining specific evaluation protocols, datasets, and success criteria will improve scientific rigor and practical viability of the experiments. This will also support safety assessments in the simulated deployment stage to mitigate risks of misleading explanations in healthcare applications.  This is essential for ensuring the method is both scientifically sound and practically feasible to implement safely in clinical environments.  Please elaborate and concretize these aspects in the experiment design and validation strategy sections of the proposal, including fallback evaluation to the proposed hybrid rule-based approaches if the NLP explanations do not meet safety and trustworthiness thresholds at scale or in real-world-like conditions.  \n\n"

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "To enhance both novelty and impact beyond the competitive landscape, consider integrating a knowledge graph-based component leveraging biomedical NLP and clinical language models to enrich the interpretability layer. Incorporating a domain-specific knowledge graph can improve causality extraction and rationale generation by grounding explanations in an explicit, formalized clinical knowledge structure, which can help enforce medically grounded rationales and facilitate alignment with clinical guidelines. This approach can also leverage attention mechanisms and supervised deep learning models trained on clinically annotated textual data such as electronic health records (potentially including public resources like the Italian Electronic Health Record corpus) to improve entity and relation extraction accuracy. Additionally, incorporating few-shot learning setups might enable adaptation to new clinical domains or patient cohorts with limited annotation, increasing scalability and generalization. This global integration would strengthen the proposal’s methodological rigor, uniqueness, and real-world applicability in clinical decision support, addressing trust and safety concerns more robustly while situating the work at the intersection of state-of-the-art biomedical NLP and clinical AI interpretability research trends."
