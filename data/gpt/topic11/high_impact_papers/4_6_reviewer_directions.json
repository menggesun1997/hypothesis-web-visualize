    "title": "Framework for Measuring and Enhancing Accuracy of AI-Generated Moderation Texts",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is an underexplored need for systematic measurement methods assessing the factual accuracy and appropriateness of AI-generated moderation texts, impacting moderation reliability and fairness.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap regarding the lack of systematic tools to measure AI text output accuracy in moderation contexts. Proposes a novel framework combining linguistic analysis, factual verification, and ethical appropriateness metrics tailored for moderation outputs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a modular evaluation suite integrating state-of-the-art natural language understanding tools for semantic consistency, external knowledge base verification modules for fact-checking, and discourse analysis tools assessing appropriateness and tone. Combine quantitative scoring with qualitative annotations to generate comprehensive accuracy indexes guiding AI output improvements.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect representative AI-generated moderation messages. 2. Annotate ground truth for factuality and appropriateness. 3. Develop and calibrate evaluation modules. 4. Benchmark accuracy scores against human judgments. 5. Utilize results to fine-tune LLMs and moderation templates. 6. Validate improvements in live moderation scenarios with user feedback.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI-generated rejection message stating misinformation detected. Evaluation framework verifies factual correctness and tone appropriateness, highlighting an overlooked subtle misrepresentation, allowing correction before deployment.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "In case automated modules fall short, supplement with crowd-annotator panels. Alternatively, focus on sub-modules with highest impact (e.g., appropriateness) for incremental improvements."
