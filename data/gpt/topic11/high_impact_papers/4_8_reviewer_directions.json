    "title": "User Trust Modeling and Enhancement through Explainability-Driven Feedback in LLM Social Media Moderation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Low user trust in AI-moderated social media content erodes platform legitimacy. Current approaches inadequately model trust dynamics or leverage explainability to improve it systematically.",
    "Motivation": "Focuses on external gaps in combining human-computer interaction and XAI to build trust models and feedback loops that enhance transparency and user acceptance of AI moderation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a computational user trust model informed by psychological theories and empirical user interaction data. Design explainability feedback systems where users receive tailored explanations and can provide input on moderation decisions. Use reinforcement learning to adapt explanation content and style to maximize trust and satisfaction.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Conduct user studies to gather trust-related interaction data. 2. Train computational trust prediction models. 3. Integrate adaptive explanation feedback systems with LLM moderation. 4. Evaluate trust improvements via surveys and behavior analysis. 5. Iterate to optimize explanation modalities and trust model accuracy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User flagged post is removed by AI; user receives a clear, jargon-free explanation with relevant context. User provides positive feedback, increasing their trust score which adapts explanation future interactions.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive explanations are ineffective, implement standardized trust-building messages and provide avenues for direct human appeal processes. Alternatively, segment users to tailor efforts to trust-vulnerable groups."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed method outlines developing a computational user trust model grounded in psychological theories and adapting explanation content via reinforcement learning, the mechanism lacks clarity on critical details. For instance, how exactly will the reinforcement learning agent represent states, actions, and rewards? How will user feedback be quantitatively captured and linked to trust signals? Greater specificity is needed on the model architecture, interpretability of trust scores, and the practical integration with existing LLM moderation pipelines to assure soundness and reproducibility. Concrete algorithmic sketches or preliminary system design would strengthen the proposal's technical credibility and clarity for reviewers and implementers alike. Clarify and detail these mechanisms in the Proposed_Method to improve soundness and feasibility of the approach, reducing ambiguity and assumptions about implementation complexity and user modeling fidelity. This will also help justify choices around explainability modalities and adaptive explanation personalization effectively in a socio-technical context. Target Section: Proposed_Method."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the existing intense research on trust and explainability in AI systems, this work could substantially benefit by explicitly integrating insights from 'human decision-making', 'user preferences', and 'adaptive learning system' concepts listed in the globally linked concepts. For example, incorporating cognitive load theory to dynamically tailor explanation complexity based on real-time user engagement signals can make the feedback more effective and personalized. Additionally, leveraging advances from 'human-computer interaction research' to shape user interface design for trust feedback loops would enhance overall usability and acceptance. This multi-disciplinary integration can differentiate the approach, broaden impact beyond social media moderation, and position it uniquely in the competitive landscape. Refine the conceptual framework and experiment plan to embed these elements explicitly and evaluate their contribution to trust modeling and enhancement.
