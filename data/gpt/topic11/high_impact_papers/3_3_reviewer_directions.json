    "title": "Spectral-EcoNet: Applying Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Principles to AI Training Environmental Signals",
    "Problem_Statement": "Precise, non-invasive measurement techniques akin to near-infrared spectroscopy are underutilized in capturing the multifaceted environmental signals during AI model training, limiting fine-grained impact assessments.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by the hidden bridge of near-infrared methods, this research advances novel signal processing frameworks to analyze environmental sensor data during AI training. It overcomes the internal gap concerning precise environmental measurement integration within AI workflows.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design Spectral-EcoNet, a neural network inspired by spectral analysis techniques that decodes multi-modal environmental sensor signals (power, temperature, carbon sensors) collected during training. The network disentangles overlapping ecological signals and estimates real-time environmental footprint components with high precision. By adapting spectral decomposition and chemometric analysis methods, the model helps uncover latent environmental factors affecting AI training sustainability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect extensive multimodal sensor data during LLM training runs.\n2. Adapt spectral analysis methods to pre-process signals.\n3. Train Spectral-EcoNet on labeled environmental impact datasets.\n4. Validate decomposition accuracy against ground truth emission data.\n5. Integrate with training monitoring dashboards.\n6. Compare with baseline aggregate metrics and ablation studies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multisensor time-series data during GPT-3-small training.\nOutput: Real-time signal decomposition yielding separate estimates of electricity usage, heat dissipation, and indirect carbon emission proxies with >90% accuracy against measured baselines.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If spectral methods prove unsuitable, explore alternate signal processing frameworks such as wavelet transforms or discrete cosine transforms. Alternatively, incorporate domain adaptation from industrial environmental monitoring datasets to improve modeling."
