          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that integrating named entity graphs with LLMs will significantly enhance transparency and interpretability for clinical reasoning. However, this assumption lacks supporting justification about how graph visualizations concretely improve trust or diagnostic accuracy beyond existing text-based explanations. Clarify why graph-based reasoning is necessary and superior for interpreting LLM outputs in clinical settings, considering known challenges in graph extraction fidelity and clinical relevance of relations extracted. Including citations or preliminary evidence supporting this assumption would strengthen the foundation of the method design and its relevance to sensitive healthcare decision-making scenarios where transparency is critical but challenging to achieve reliably with current LLM explainability tools. Without a robust rationale, the soundness of this core premise remains insufficiently substantiated, potentially undermining downstream feasibility and impact claims. Hence, I recommend explicitly articulating and empirically backing the core assumption that named entity graphs provide meaningful added transparency beyond natural language explanations in clinical AI applications. This should be addressed prior to or within early experiment phases to ensure resources target a valid interpretability gap specific to clinical contexts rather than a general or presumed one. This will help ensure the method’s soundness and clarify the unique interpretability contribution to the clinical AI trustworthiness discourse currently dominated by black-box LLM approaches.

          "feedback_content": "The experiment plan outlines relevant steps but lacks detail on critical feasibility aspects necessary for success: 1) Annotating datasets with clinical entities and relations is a known bottleneck requiring domain expertise and costly manual work; a clear sourcing strategy and scale expectations are needed. 2) The graph extraction and integration with LLMs are complex tasks, but technical risks and fallback contingencies beyond graph simplification are not sufficiently elaborated—e.g., handling noisy entity/relation extraction or ambiguity in clinical notes. 3) Metrics for 'explanation completeness' and 'fidelity' should be clearly defined with measurable criteria and validation protocols, including how clinician trust will be quantitatively assessed beyond subjective impressions. 4) The pilot study design with clinical users needs elaboration regarding selection criteria, sample size, and evaluation settings to realistically assess actual impact on decision-making. Without these details, the plan risks underestimating resource/time requirements or missing critical failure modes, reducing project feasibility. I recommend expanding the experiment plan to include detailed annotation strategies (automatic plus manual hybrid?), concrete evaluation metrics and baselines, robustness checks for extraction errors, and a structured clinical trial design with ethics considerations early on to ensure scientific rigor and feasibility of delivering meaningful results.
