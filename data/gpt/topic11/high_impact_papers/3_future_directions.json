        "title": "EcoXAI: Real-Time Environmental Transparency for LLM Training",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current AI training pipelines of large language models lack integrated, interpretable environmental impact metrics, making it difficult to understand and mitigate the ecological footprint during training.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the internal gap of underexplored integration of environmental impact metrics into AI workflows, leveraging the near-infrared spectroscopy analogy for precise monitoring, combined with XAI interpretability paradigms. It offers a novel, real-time ecological transparency tool for practitioners.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop EcoXAI, a modular software framework that employs sensor data analogous to near-infrared spectral analysis to monitor energy consumption, heat generation, and carbon emissions during neural network training. This data is fed into interpretable XAI modules that visualize and explain, in real time, how architectural choices and training configurations affect ecological metrics. The system supports integration with common ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) and presents dashboards for multi-dimensional trade-off analysis between performance and environmental impact.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect energy and environmental data during training of benchmark LLMs (e.g., GPT-2, BERT) using specialized hardware sensors and system metrics.\n2. Develop interpretable models mapping architectural elements and hyperparameters to environmental impact data.\n3. Implement EcoXAI dashboard and real-time feedback loops.\n4. Evaluate on standard NLP benchmarks and measure accuracy, energy usage, and user interpretability through expert studies.\n5. Compare with existing post-hoc environmental reporting methods.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Start training BERT-base with EcoXAI enabled.\nOutput: Real-time dashboard shows spikes in power consumption correlated to batch size increments, with interpretable explanations suggesting energy-saving batch sizes with minimal accuracy loss.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time monitoring is noisy or inaccurate, fallback to batched post-training environmental assessments. Explore alternative environmental proxies such as workload-based estimations if sensors fail. Adjust interpretability models to simpler surrogate models if complexity overwhelms users."

        "Problem_Statement": "Tracking and auditing the environmental impact of large AI model training lacks transparency and immutability, decreasing trust and accountability among stakeholders.",
        "Motivation": "This idea directly expands on the high-potential innovation opportunity of employing blockchain and privacy-enhancing tech to track training energy and carbon footprints, bridging Facebook research and XAI insights. It introduces a verifiable, decentralized environmental accountability framework.",

        "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain overhead is prohibitive, explore hybrid decentralized ledger technologies or distributed timestamping schemes. Develop stronger anonymization methods to alleviate privacy concerns. Alternatively, implement centralized but cryptographically verifiable audit logs."
