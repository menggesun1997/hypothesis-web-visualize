    "title": "Ontology-Driven Privacy Policies for Financial LLMs in Decentralized Knowledge Ecosystems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of standardized, machine-interpretable privacy and consent policies tailored for LLMs integrating multi-organizational financial knowledge bases complicates scalable privacy preservation and provenance enforcement.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap concerning missing standardized online reference frameworks combining provenance, user privacy, and data integrity inspired by domain theorization from archaeology and health data governance. Proposes an ontology-based policy framework to codify and automate privacy constraints within financial LLM knowledge ecosystems.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a modular policy ontology that captures hierarchical privacy requirements, data provenance attributes, and user consent semantics relevant to financial data. Integrate this ontology into LLM data ingestion and training pipelines enabling automated compliance checks, dynamic data filtering, and provenance-aware knowledge base construction. The policy reasoner supports conflict resolution and cross-organizational harmonization in decentralized setups.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Formalize the privacy ontology based on GDPR, HIPAA, and finance-specific regulations; 2) Annotate existing financial datasets with policy tags using the ontology; 3) Implement ontology-aware data loaders for LLM fine-tuning; 4) Test automated policy compliance enforcement compared to manual curation; 5) Measure accuracy, policy violation rates, and knowledge base consistency; 6) Validate scalability on multi-institutional simulated data sharing scenarios.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Financial datasets tagged with layered privacy policies and provenance information; Output: An LLM training dataset that automatically excludes data violating consent or provenance constraints while maximizing training data coverage.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If full ontology automation is infeasible, implement semi-automated policy tagging assisted by domain experts or employ rule-based proxy methods adaptable to evolving compliance requirements."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while comprehensive in developing and validating the ontology-based privacy policies, lacks clarity regarding practical integration and evaluation within real-world or sufficiently realistic decentralized financial environments. It should explicitly address how diverse, heterogeneous financial organizations' data schemas and privacy requirements will be reconciled and tested beyond simulated scenarios to ensure robustness and practicality. Inclusion of user studies or stakeholder feedback on policy effectiveness and acceptance could strengthen feasibility validation. Moreover, the plan could benefit from detailing baseline comparisons (e.g., against existing privacy-preserving frameworks) to concretely demonstrate improvement and scalability in decentralized multi-organizational setups, especially under adversarial or conflict scenarios inherent in decentralized knowledge ecosystems. Incorporating these points would enhance the scientific rigor and practical viability of the experimental evaluation phase, ensuring that the proposed ontology and reasoner are meaningfully validated under conditions reflecting real operational constraints in financial LLM ecosystems, which is crucial given the complexity of the problem domain and regulatory requirements involved.  Suggestion: explicitly include cross-organizational data interoperability tests, adversarial policy conflict resolution experiments, and comparative benchmarks with existing manual and automated privacy enforcement techniques in multi-party decentralized financial contexts within the experiment plan to bolster feasibility evidence and practical relevance of the framework being proposed.  In summary, clarify and expand the experimental validation scope to convincingly demonstrate the system's feasibility and robustness in real-world or close-to-real financial decentralized knowledge sharing environments, beyond primarily simulated data sharing scenarios presently proposed in Step 6. This will reduce risks that the system’s complexity and regulatory nuances may not be adequately addressed in practice, thus increasing confidence in the project's execution feasibility and impact potential. This is the most critical point that the authors must immediately address to strengthen the proposal’s foundation and prospects for success in practice and deployment in real multi-institutional financial contexts with rigorous privacy constraints and provenance enforcement needs, as stated in the Problem Statement and Proposed Method sections. "

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty screening verdict of NOV-COMPETITIVE, to substantially elevate the proposal’s impact and novelty, I strongly recommend explicitly integrating globally linked advanced concepts such as 'Verifiable Credentials' and 'decentralized identifiers' to enhance trustworthiness and cryptographically verifiable provenance enforcement in the decentralized knowledge ecosystem. For instance, combining the ontology-driven policy framework with verifiable credential technology could create a robust, privacy-preserving mechanism enabling LLMs to automatically verify user consents and data provenance cryptographically across organizations without exposing raw data or private keys. This fusion could offer a novel, end-to-end privacy and compliance enforcement paradigm, going beyond policy annotation to automated, cryptographically grounded trust and policy validation in decentralized multi-agent knowledge sharing systems. Additionally, incorporating fine-grained access control mechanisms or zero-knowledge proof constructs could offer cutting-edge control over who accesses data and how policy adherence is verifiably enforced without compromising privacy, directly addressing the central challenges defined in the Problem Statement. Taking this route would mitigate the risk of the project being another incremental integration within a competitive area and would position it as a pioneering framework leveraging state-of-the-art blockchain-related trust technologies tailored to financial LLM governance, significantly boosting both scholarly novelty and industrial impact. I suggest the proposal explicitly elaborate how these concepts can be synergistically integrated into the proposed ontology and policy reasoner modules — possibly in an extended architecture diagram and experimental validation plan — thereby transforming it into a differentiated and highly impactful research contribution with a clear competitive edge and broad applicability in emerging decentralized finance and AI governance landscapes."
