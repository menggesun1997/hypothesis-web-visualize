    "title": "Health-Model Inspired Scalable Privacy-Compliant Knowledge Bases for Financial LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current online reference frameworks for LLMs in financial domains lack scalable curation and privacy management mechanisms that address provenance and data integrity challenges at institutional scale while complying with strict privacy regulations.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external gap identified by the hidden bridge connecting 'online reference work' with health administrative data privacy and curation models. Proposes a novel cross-disciplinary framework adapting health data governance principles to financial LLM knowledge base construction to enhance trust, scalability, and privacy.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a knowledge base framework that modularly incorporates curation layers enforcing provenance tracking, data anonymization via differential privacy mechanisms, and user-centric access control modeled after health data governance policies. The framework supports incremental updates validated by integrity checks and federated audits, deploying LLM fine-tuning datasets that are dynamically balanced for privacy, utility, and compliance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Create a proxy financial knowledge base from anonymized financial reports and client profiles; 2) Implement differential privacy protection and access control modules inspired by HIPAA frameworks; 3) Integrate with LLM training pipelines for fine-tuning; 4) Benchmark against standard non-private curated datasets for accuracy and compliance metrics; 5) Conduct privacy attack simulations to test defense robustness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Anonymized transaction histories and market trend reports with metadata provenance tags; Output: Privacy-compliant LLM trained to answer \"What are the emerging credit risks for SME clients in Q2?\" without compromising underlying client data confidentiality or provenance traceability.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct adaptation of health governance models proves too restrictive, implement customizable policy templates allowing domain experts to tune privacy-utility trade-offs. Alternatively, explore synthetic data augmentation to reduce reliance on sensitive real data."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The proposal relies heavily on the assumption that health data governance models (e.g., HIPAA-based frameworks) can be directly adapted to financial LLM knowledge bases without significant modifications. Given the substantial differences in data types, regulatory environments, and threat models between health and financial sectors, this assumption may oversimplify complex domain-specific requirements. The authors should critically analyze potential divergences and justify the transposability of health governance principles more explicitly or propose extensions to handle financial domain nuances robustly, rather than assuming a direct mapping suffices for provenance, privacy, and compliance enforcement at institutional scale, thus ensuring soundness before implementation begins.\n\nAdditionally, the assumption that differential privacy and federated audits can be seamlessly integrated into dynamic, incremental financial knowledge bases while maintaining model utility and compliance deserves deeper justification with respect to scale, model update frequency, and adversarial contexts specific to financial institutions to validate foundational soundness and guard against overly optimistic premises that could undermine the feasibility and trustworthiness of the framework in practice (SOU-ASSUMPTION)."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed experiment plan outlines a reasonable stepwise approach but lacks critical details to establish scientific rigor and practical feasibility. Specifically, the plan omits how the anonymized proxy financial data will be generated or sourced, which is essential given increasing financial data sensitivity and privacy regulations; without access to realistic data, experimental validation may be compromised.\n\nMoreover, the plan does not specify metrics and benchmarks for 'accuracy' and 'compliance' explicitly, nor does it describe how privacy attack simulations will be designed to reflect realistic threat models relevant to financial contexts. Including concrete evaluation protocols, dataset curation strategies ensuring compliance with existing financial data regulations, and performance thresholds is crucial. To improve feasibility, explicit risk assessment, timelines for iterative testing, and fallback decision points in the experiment pipeline could further solidify the practicality and reproducibility of the approach (FEA-EXPERIMENT)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the interdisciplinary framing, integrating concepts from 'Data Protection Regulation' and 'General Data Protection Regulation' more explicitly—beyond just HIPAA analogies—could enhance compliance coverage and broaden impact, especially in multinational financial contexts.\n\nAdditionally, enriching the framework with adaptive policy enforcement mechanisms inspired by 'attribute-based access control' and leveraging 'health informatics technologies' for automated auditing can improve scalability and governance efficacy. Exploring integration of federated learning approaches akin to those in genomic analysis or electronic health record privacy preservation might further advance privacy-utility trade-offs.\n\nThis could also extend to developing AI tooling support for systematic policy review or compliance certification leveraging 'systematic literature review' methods within the framework. Such integrations would elevate the framework’s sophistication, addressing the competitive nature of the field and potentially deepening originality and practical deployment prospects (SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION)."
