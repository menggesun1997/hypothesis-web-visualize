        "title": "Adaptive Socio-Technical Moderation Framework Using Organizational Learning and XAI Feedback Loops",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current social media moderation powered by large language models (LLMs) lacks adaptive frameworks that systematically integrate continuous organizational learning with explainable AI feedback to ensure fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics (FATE). Existing solutions suffer from static rule enforcement and opaque decision-making, impairing trust, and responsiveness to evolving societal norms.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of fragmented integration between communication/media studies and XAI and the external gap involving the underutilized application of organizational learning theories and digital leadership to drive dynamic AI governance. This approach transforms how adaptive, transparent, and human-centered moderation systems evolve by embedding learning cycles and explainability directly into AI governance frameworks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a socio-technical framework that couples LLM-driven moderation with organizational learning mechanisms. Integrate continuous feedback loops from moderators and community stakeholders via explainable AI modules that provide interpretable rationales (leveraging LIME and SHAP) for moderation decisions. Design digital leadership protocols that use this feedback to update moderation policies dynamically. Employ hybrid models combining reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with organizational change management processes to iteratively adjust AI behavior and governance rules in an accountable and transparent manner.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect moderated social media datasets across evolving policy periods. 2. Implement baseline LLM moderation with static policies. 3. Develop the proposed adaptive framework with integrated XAI explanations and organizational learning feedback loops. 4. Evaluate improvements via metrics on fairness (demographic parity, equality of opportunity), accountability (auditability scores), transparency (explanation fidelity), and ethics (bias metrics). 5. Conduct user studies with moderators assessing trust and usability. 6. Compare dynamic vs. static governance impacts on moderation quality and organizational responsiveness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User posts a borderline hate speech content on a platform. The LLM provides a moderation decision with an explanation (e.g., highlighting specific phrases triggering hate speech flags). Feedback from moderators disagrees with the decision and provides contextual insight. The system logs this input and adjusts the moderation criteria in the next update cycle, reducing false positives and improving fairness.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time adaptation is unstable, implement batched policy updates using periodic organizational review panels aggregating moderated feedback. Alternatively, focus on enhancing explanation quality as a first step before incorporating organizational learning loops fully."

        "title": "Transparent Interactive Moderation Dashboards Leveraging Advanced XAI and Human-Centered UI Design",
        "Problem_Statement": "Social media moderators and users often face black-box AI moderation decisions, resulting in low trust, misunderstandings, and reduced acceptance of automated moderation. Current explainability tools are fragmented and lack integration with UI designs tailored for diverse user expertise.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap in integrating communication research and XAI via advanced algorithms and UI design to create truly transparent, user-friendly moderation tools. This bridges practical deficits in explainability and accountability by making AI decisions accessible and interactive, improving transparency and trustworthiness.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create an interactive moderation dashboard combining state-of-the-art local explainability methods (e.g., LIME, counterfactual explanations) with adaptive UI elements customized for moderator expertise and user roles. Incorporate multi-modal outputs (text highlights, visual graphs, actionable suggestions) that explain the rationale behind each moderation decision. Implement feedback mechanisms for moderators and users to query, contest, and understand AI decisions, fostering co-learning between human and AI agents.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Design and develop the interactive dashboard prototype. 2. Integrate LLM-based moderation systems with embedded XAI modules. 3. Recruit moderators and user participants for scenario-based testing. 4. Measure usability via SUS score, as well as trust and transparency via validated questionnaires. 5. Compare decision accuracy and acceptance rates before and after dashboard introduction. 6. Analyze interaction logs to refine explainability methods and UI flow.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A flagged sarcastic post that the AI classifies as harmful speech. The dashboard highlights sarcastic markers and explains classification uncertainty. The moderator interacts with the interface to review alternative interpretations and can override the decision. User feedback is recorded to improve future moderation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If complexity overwhelms users, simplify dashboards by prioritizing core explanations and offering advanced details on-demand. Alternatively, replace some interactive features with video or chatbot-based explanations to better suit user preferences."

        "title": "Socio-Technical Organizational Framework for Ethics-Focused AI Adoption Using TAM and HCI Principles",
        "Problem_Statement": "Media companies struggle with integrating fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics-focused AI solutions into existing organizational workflows due to socio-technical misalignment, lack of user acceptance, and governance challenges.",
        "Motivation": "Fills a critical external gap by applying technology acceptance models (TAM) and human-computer interaction (HCI) frameworks from management sciences to guide ethical AI adoption, overcoming internal limitations of insufficient systematic integration and organizational resistance to AI governance innovations.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an organizational framework and toolkit combining TAM constructs (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use) and HCI design heuristics to guide the deployment, training, and governance of FATE-oriented AI moderation tools. Embed change management strategies and continuous stakeholder engagement in a phased rollout plan. Create maturity models for ethical AI integration that adapt to organizational culture and technological readiness levels.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Conduct qualitative interviews and surveys with media company employees to assess baseline AI attitudes. 2. Develop TAM-HCI based intervention toolkits for AI adoption. 3. Pilot AI moderation tools with designed frameworks in real or simulated media environments. 4. Measure acceptance, ethical compliance, user satisfaction, and operational efficiency pre- and post-intervention. 5. Iterate framework based on feedback and organizational learning.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A media company planning to deploy an AI moderation system encounters staff concerns about transparency and fairness. The framework identifies key barriers via TAM surveys and prescribes targeted HCI-designed training and interface modifications to enhance adoption and governance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If adoption resistance persists, incorporate external facilitators (consultants) and integrate regulatory compliance incentives and certifications. Alternatively, trial governance sandbox environments that allow experimentation with AI moderation under controlled ethical oversight."

        "title": "Hybrid Bias Detection and Mitigation Framework for Generative AI Moderation Outputs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Generative AI models used in social media moderation can produce biased or inaccurate texts influenced by their training data, yet existing methods insufficiently understand or mitigate these biases systematically.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap regarding insufficient appreciation of generative AI biases tied to training datasets and the lack of methods measuring AI-produced text accuracy. Proposes a novel hybrid bias detection framework leveraging linguistic, sociological, and computational metrics to systematically identify and correct bias in moderation outputs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design and implement a multi-layered bias detection system that combines quantitative bias metrics (e.g., demographic parity shifts, sentiment disparities) with qualitative analysis from sociolinguistic experts. Integrate adversarial datasets to stress-test generative biases, and develop bias-correcting fine-tuning pipelines informed by continuous monitoring. Employ auditors and human-in-the-loop mechanisms for ongoing supervision.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate diverse datasets annotated for demographic and ideological attributes. 2. Generate moderation texts using LLMs. 3. Apply bias detection metrics and crowdsource expert reviews. 4. Fine-tune models using bias-driven loss functions. 5. Re-assess bias levels post-mitigation. 6. Track improvements in fairness, accuracy, and user trust metrics across multiple deployment phases.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Moderation output rejecting posts disproportionately flagged from minority language dialects. Bias detector identifies demographic skew. Fine-tuning model reduces false positives related to dialectical variations, improving fairness.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full bias correction is unachievable, implement bias-warning modules that flag possibly biased outputs for human review. Alternatively, restrict generative components in sensitive moderation decisions pending better bias controls."

        "title": "Systematic Integration Framework for Explainability in Organizational Digital Transformation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Despite significant research on explainable AI (XAI) and organizational digital transformation, there is a lack of systematic methods integrating explainability seamlessly within complex organizational change processes, weakening ethical AI deployments.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap highlighting limited integration of explainability into organizational digital transformation frameworks. This project innovates by codifying processes that embed XAI into every stage of organizational change for AI governance, fostering ethical compliance and stakeholder alignment.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-phase integration framework that maps organizational transformation milestones (e.g., strategy, training, operationalization) onto explainability deliverables (e.g., interpretability reports, transparency dashboards, ethical impact assessments). Design toolkits and templates for stakeholders at each phase to incorporate explainability artifacts using communication research principles and change management best practices.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Analyze existing case studies of AI digital transformation. 2. Identify key inflection points for explainability interventions. 3.
