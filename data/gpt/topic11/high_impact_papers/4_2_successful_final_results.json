    "title": "Socio-Technical Organizational Framework for Ethics-Focused AI Adoption Using TAM and HCI Principles",
    "Problem_Statement": "Media companies struggle with integrating fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics-focused AI solutions into existing organizational workflows due to socio-technical misalignment, lack of user acceptance, and governance challenges.",
    "Motivation": "Fills a critical external gap by applying technology acceptance models (TAM) and human-computer interaction (HCI) frameworks from management sciences to guide ethical AI adoption, overcoming internal limitations of insufficient systematic integration and organizational resistance to AI governance innovations.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an organizational framework and toolkit combining TAM constructs (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use) and HCI design heuristics to guide the deployment, training, and governance of FATE-oriented AI moderation tools. Embed change management strategies and continuous stakeholder engagement in a phased rollout plan. Create maturity models for ethical AI integration that adapt to organizational culture and technological readiness levels.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Conduct qualitative interviews and surveys with media company employees to assess baseline AI attitudes. 2. Develop TAM-HCI based intervention toolkits for AI adoption. 3. Pilot AI moderation tools with designed frameworks in real or simulated media environments. 4. Measure acceptance, ethical compliance, user satisfaction, and operational efficiency pre- and post-intervention. 5. Iterate framework based on feedback and organizational learning.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A media company planning to deploy an AI moderation system encounters staff concerns about transparency and fairness. The framework identifies key barriers via TAM surveys and prescribes targeted HCI-designed training and interface modifications to enhance adoption and governance.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adoption resistance persists, incorporate external facilitators (consultants) and integrate regulatory compliance incentives and certifications. Alternatively, trial governance sandbox environments that allow experimentation with AI moderation under controlled ethical oversight."

        "title": "Integrated Socio-Technical Framework for Ethics-Driven AI Adoption in Media Companies Using UTAUT, Organizational Trust, and HCI Principles",
        "Problem_Statement": "Media companies face substantial challenges in embedding fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethical AI practices into existing workflows. These arise from socio-technical misalignments, latent organizational resistance, and governance complexities that hinder sustainable adoption of FATE-oriented AI systems, including moderation tools. Current approaches insufficiently operationalize technology acceptance theories in organizational contexts, limiting their impact on ethical AI governance.",
        "Motivation": "To address the NOV-COMPETITIVE landscape where tightly coupled TAM and HCI frameworks are prevalent, this research advances a differentiated, theoretically rigorous socio-technical framework. By integrating the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), organizational trust dimensions informed by trustworthy AI research, and human-computer interaction design heuristics, the framework transcends existing models that focus narrowly on perceived usefulness and ease of use. This expanded model incorporates social influence, facilitating conditions, and trust to more holistically capture complex ethical AI adoption dynamics in media firms. Our approach advances managerial and technical integration by providing explicit mappings from these constructs to actionable interventions and governance roles, thus enabling pragmatic transformation of organizational culture and practices towards ethics-focused AI deployment. This contributes a novel, replicable, and scientifically grounded pathway for media companies to overcome ethical governance and acceptance barriers amidst digital transformation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-layered organizational framework that concretely integrates UTAUT constructs—performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions—with organizational trust components (ability, integrity, benevolence) drawn from trustworthy AI literature, combined with domain-tailored HCI principles to operationalize ethics-focused AI adoption. Specifically, the framework decomposes these constructs into mapped components of an intervention toolkit: \n\n1. **Toolkit Features:** Targeted training modules and interface design adaptations addressing effort expectancy and enhancing perceived ease of use through user-centered interaction heuristics. \n\n2. **Governance Processes:** Defined organizational roles and decision-making protocols embedding transparency and accountability mechanisms, directly linked to performance expectancy and trust facilitation. \n\n3. **Stakeholder Engagement Practices:** Change management activities designed to harness social influence by activating executive sponsorship and peer champions, and improving facilitating conditions via resource access and organizational readiness assessments. \n\n4. **Contextual Adaptation Layer:** Incorporates organizational maturity and cultural readiness metrics that modulate interventions dynamically to diverse media company contexts, supported by diagnostic surveys and feedback loops.\n\nWe detail these mechanisms through conceptual workflow diagrams illustrating feedback cycles among user perceptions, trust-building activities, interface design iterations, and governance updates. This structured yet adaptive approach operationalizes the theoretical constructs into an actionable and testable organizational model for ethical AI embedding, explicitly contextualized for media companies’ socio-technical realities.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Conduct comprehensive mixed-method baseline assessment of media company AI adoption attitudes and trust dimensions using validated UTAUT questionnaires augmented with organizational trust scales.\n2. Employ structural equation modeling (SEM) to validate relationships among UTAUT and trust constructs in the media context, identifying key drivers and barriers.\n3. Co-design intervention toolkits encompassing HCI-guided interface modifications, tailored training modules, and governance templates aligned with identified acceptance drivers.\n4. Pilot deployment of AI moderation tools integrated with the intervention framework in controlled media firm settings.\n5. Measure pre- and post-intervention changes using SEM-informed metrics: acceptance, trust levels, ethical compliance indicators, user satisfaction, and operational efficiency.\n6. Iteratively refine the framework and toolkit based on quantitative findings and qualitative feedback, adapting to organizational maturity and cultural readiness profiles.\n7. Document and model causal pathways from interventions to ethics-focused AI adoption outcomes, enabling scalability and replicability beyond initial cases.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A large media organization aims to implement an AI moderation system but encounters staff skepticism around the AI’s fairness and concerns about transparency.\n- Diagnostic UTAUT-trust surveys reveal low social influence and limited trust in governance.\n- The framework prescribes tailored user interface adaptations enhancing transparency cues, a participatory training program addressing ethical AI literacy, and formalized governance roles to institutionalize accountability.\n- Change management leverages influential team leads to positively shift social influence.\n- Post-implementation metrics collected via SEM show improved acceptance and trust scores, alongside increased ethical compliance and operational performance.\nThis example demonstrates how the integrated framework translates theory into concrete, context-adapted interventions that pragmatically address socio-technical and ethical challenges within media organizations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If persistent adoption resistance or trust deficits arise despite framework deployment, we will introduce external ethical AI facilitators experienced in media techno-social dynamics to provide focused consultation and mediation. Additionally, we propose piloting regulatory compliance incentive schemes linked to formal certifications, thereby aligning organizational motivations with external accountability pressures. Parallel to these efforts, sandbox environments for ethical AI experimentation will be established, creating low-risk spaces for iterative testing of moderation tools under controlled oversight, allowing organizations to build confidence and maturity gradually. These fallback pathways ensure robustness against entrenched organizational barriers and complement the core framework with systemic reinforcement mechanisms."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method presents an overall promising integration of TAM constructs and HCI heuristics but lacks detailed clarity on how these components concretely interact within the organizational workflow. The mechanism by which perceived usefulness and ease of use will translate into actionable interventions remains high-level and would benefit from a precise mapping of theoretical constructs to specific toolkit features and governance processes, ensuring the framework's operationalizability in diverse media company contexts. Providing more explicit examples or a conceptual model illustrating these dynamics will strengthen the soundness and persuasiveness of the methodology section, making it clear how theoretical insights drive practical change rather than remain abstract notions or checklists, which could fail to overcome real organizational resistance or governance challenges effectively. This clarification is especially crucial given the socio-technical complexity and latent organizational resistance outlined in the problem statement, which demands more than just aggregating existing theories—it requires a clear, testable pathway from theory to impactful practice within media firm structures and cultures. Targeting this will also enhance feasibility by enabling precise measurements and adaptations during experimentation phases, and ultimately support replicability and broader adoption of the framework across organizational settings beyond the initial use cases described.  Thus, tightening and detailing the mechanism linking TAM-HCI constructs to intervention actions is essential for the idea’s core contribution and feasibility under real-world constraints underpinned by socio-technical systems research and change management theory integration.  Constraints such as varying organizational maturity and cultural readiness must be explicitly considered and integrated into the intervention logic to move beyond a generic proposal towards a concrete, deployable organizational framework for ethical AI adoption in media companies that addresses transparency, fairness, and accountability challenges pragmatically and sustainably.  Consider augmenting this section with formalized conceptual diagrams or workflows, and referencing or adapting existing validated organizational change or technology adoption models to scaffold the innovative combination proposed here, ensuring conceptual rigor and practical clarity concurrently.  The present state risks seeming an assemblage of existing concepts rather than a novel, sound, and clearly implementable framework, which may impact perceived contribution and reviewer confidence in outcomes and adoption beyond pilot cases.  Building this robustness is critical given the complex social-technical nature and high-stakes ethics governance context the research aims to engage and transform effectively, and thus must be prioritized before advancing to large-scale experimentation and impact claims.  In summary, please enhance the Proposed_Method section by concretely detailing the integration mechanism of TAM and HCI principles within the organizational framework, including clear mapping to toolkit components, governance roles, and stakeholder engagement practices, explicitly contextualized for media company socio-technical landscapes and change management needs to ensure soundness and subsequent feasibility and impact potential with greater confidence and clarity.

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and strong existing linkages among TAM, HCI, and ethics in AI adoption, a strategic enhancement to increase competitiveness and impact would be to integrate additional globally-linked concepts such as 'Unified Theory of Acceptance', 'structural equation modeling', and 'organisational trust' into the framework. Specifically, adopting the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as a foundational model can strengthen the theoretical underpinning and offer a richer set of constructs beyond perceived usefulness and ease of use, such as social influence and facilitating conditions, which are critical for complex organizational change. Incorporating structural equation modeling (SEM) within the experimental plan to quantitatively validate the model’s relationships will enhance scientific rigor, enabling clearer causal inferences and substantive insights into the socio-technical acceptance dynamics. Furthermore, explicitly embedding organizational trust dimensions into the framework — drawing from trustworthy AI literature and human-technology interaction — can address critical governance and ethical concerns more holistically. This multi-theory integration will differentiate the approach from existing ones by providing a more comprehensive, scientifically robust, and socially grounded organizational framework that better captures the nuanced barriers and enablers of ethics-focused AI adoption in media companies. It also aligns seamlessly with the phased rollout and stakeholder engagement design, allowing precise tailoring of interventions based on validated acceptance drivers and trust factors unique to this domain. Embracing these dimensions will make the research substantially more competitive, theoretically sophisticated, and practically impactful, enhancing chances of broader adoption and influence within both academic and practitioner communities focused on trustworthy AI and human-centered technological innovation in cultural industries. Feedback targets 'Proposed_Method' and implicates the Experiment_Plan. Code: SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION."
