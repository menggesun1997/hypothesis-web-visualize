    "title": "Integrating Econometric Disentanglement into Federated Healthcare LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current disentanglement techniques inadequately address the complex socioeconomic biases in healthcare LLMs across distributed data sources.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gap on maturity of fairness techniques like disentanglement and federated learning by merging econometric methodologies for causal disentanglement with federated LLM training, engaging Opportunity 1.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an econometrics-based disentanglement module embedded within federated LLM training. This module separates socioeconomic confounders from clinical signal via instrumental variables and causal inference principles, enabling bias-reducing updates without centralizing data.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Use federated EHR datasets with socioeconomic annotations.\n2) Implement disentanglement based on instrumental variable techniques.\n3) Integrate with federated update rules.\n4) Compare bias mitigation and predictive performance against standard federated learning.\n5) Evaluate via causal inference metrics and fairness tests.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Federated datasets with intertwined clinical and socioeconomic signals.\nOutput: LLM predictions disentangling socioeconomic bias to improve equitable clinical risk assessments.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If causal disentanglement underperforms, fallback to proxy variable adjustment or hybrid models with partial centralization for sensitive features."

          "feedback_content": "The assumption that econometric instrumental variable techniques can robustly disentangle socioeconomic confounders from clinical signals within federated LLM training is ambitious but underdeveloped in the proposal. There is limited discussion on defining valid instruments or dealing with weak or invalid instruments, which are common challenges in causal inference. Clarify feasibility and validity of these assumptions within federated settings where data distributions and confounders may vary across sites, and provide preliminary theoretical justification or pilot experiments to support the key causal assumptions before full integration in LLM training. Addressing this will strengthen the conceptual soundness and foundation of the methodology proposed in the 'Proposed_Method'. They must elaborate on how causal identification will be ensured without centralized data aggregation, considering federated heterogeneity and potential confounders’ complexity in healthcare data contexts."

        {
          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan outlines relevant stages, but it lacks specifics on federated dataset availability, quality, and annotation completeness for socioeconomic variables, which are critical for realistic evaluation. The plan should explicitly discuss how to handle data heterogeneity and privacy-preserving constraints that may impact instrumental variable estimation and causal disentanglement. Also, the proposal should specify concrete metrics and benchmarks for fairness evaluations tailored to healthcare LLMs, and describe fallback strategies with clearer decision criteria. More details on the integration of econometric disentanglement into federated LLM update rules and infrastructure/software stack choices would improve practical feasibility assessment. These additions will enhance confidence in the experimental validation’s robustness and real-world applicability."
