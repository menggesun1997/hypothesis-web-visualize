For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Artificial Intelligence (AI): Multidisciplinary perspectives on emerging challenges, opportunities, and agenda for research, practice and policy', 'abstract': 'As far back as the industrial revolution, significant development in technical innovation has succeeded in transforming numerous manual tasks and processes that had been in existence for decades where humans had reached the limits of physical capacity. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers this same transformative potential for the augmentation and potential replacement of human tasks and activities within a wide range of industrial, intellectual and social applications. The pace of change for this new AI technological age is staggering, with new breakthroughs in algorithmic machine learning and autonomous decision-making, engendering new opportunities for continued innovation. The impact of AI could be significant, with industries ranging from: finance, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, supply chain, logistics and utilities, all potentially disrupted by the onset of AI technologies. The study brings together the collective insight from a number of leading expert contributors to highlight the significant opportunities, realistic assessment of impact, challenges and potential research agenda posed by the rapid emergence of AI within a number of domains: business and management, government, public sector, and science and technology. This research offers significant and timely insight to AI technology and its impact on the future of industry and society in general, whilst recognising the societal and industrial influence on pace and direction of AI development.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): What we know and what is left to attain Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence', 'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently being utilized in a wide range of sophisticated applications, but the outcomes of many AI models are challenging to comprehend and trust due to their black-box nature. Usually, it is essential to understand the reasoning behind an AI model’s decision-making. Thus, the need for eXplainable AI (XAI) methods for improving trust in AI models has arisen. XAI has become a popular research subject within the AI field in recent years. Existing survey papers have tackled the concepts of XAI, its general terms, and post-hoc explainability methods but there have not been any reviews that have looked at the assessment methods, available tools, XAI datasets, and other related aspects. Therefore, in this comprehensive study, we provide readers with an overview of the current research and trends in this rapidly emerging area with a case study example. The study starts by explaining the background of XAI, common definitions, and summarizing recently proposed techniques in XAI for supervised machine learning. The review divides XAI techniques into four axes using a hierarchical categorization system: (i) data explainability, (ii) model explainability, (iii) post-hoc explainability, and (iv) assessment of explanations. We also introduce available evaluation metrics as well as open-source packages and datasets with future research directions. Then, the significance of explainability in terms of legal demands, user viewpoints, and application orientation is outlined, termed as XAI concerns. This paper advocates for tailoring explanation content to specific user types. An examination of XAI techniques and evaluation was conducted by looking at 410 critical articles, published between January 2016 and October 2022, in reputed journals and using a wide range of research databases as a source of information. The article is aimed at XAI researchers who are interested in making their AI models more trustworthy, as well as towards researchers from other disciplines who are looking for effective XAI methods to complete tasks with confidence while communicating meaning from data.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'The Science of Citizen Science', 'abstract': 'This open access book discusses how the involvement of citizens into scientific endeavors is expected to contribute to solve the big challenges of our time, such as climate change and the loss of biodiversity, growing inequalities within and between societies, and the sustainability turn. The field of citizen science has been growing in recent decades. Many different stakeholders from scientists to citizens and from policy makers to environmental organisations have been involved in its practice. In addition, many scientists also study citizen science as a research approach and as a way for science and society to interact and collaborate. This book provides a representation of the practices as well as scientific and societal outcomes in different disciplines. It reflects the contribution of citizen science to societal development, education, or innovation and provides and overview of the field of actors as well as on tools and guidelines. It serves as an introduction for anyone who wants to get involved in and learn more about the science of citizen science.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Trustworthy AI: From Principles to Practices', 'abstract': 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has enabled the deployment of various systems based on it. However, many current AI systems are found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection. These shortcomings degrade user experience and erode people’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we provide AI practitioners with a comprehensive guide for building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, and accountability. To unify currently available but fragmented approaches toward trustworthy AI, we organize them in a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to system development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items for practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers, engineers, and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges for the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for a paradigm shift toward comprehensively trustworthy AI systems.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Explainable Artificial Intelligence in education', 'abstract': 'There are emerging concerns about the Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics (FATE) of educational interventions supported by the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. One of the emerging methods for increasing trust in AI systems is to use eXplainable AI (XAI), which promotes the use of methods that produce transparent explanations and reasons for decisions AI systems make. Considering the existing literature on XAI, this paper argues that XAI in education has commonalities with the broader use of AI but also has distinctive needs. Accordingly, we first present a framework, referred to as XAI-ED, that considers six key aspects in relation to explainability for studying, designing and developing educational AI tools. These key aspects focus on the stakeholders, benefits, approaches for presenting explanations, widely used classes of AI models, human-centred designs of the AI interfaces and potential pitfalls of providing explanations within education. We then present four comprehensive case studies that illustrate the application of XAI-ED in four different educational AI tools. The paper concludes by discussing opportunities, challenges and future research needs for the effective incorporation of XAI in education.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'International Encyclopedia of Statistical Science', 'abstract': 'The goal of this book is multidimensional: a) to help reviving Statistics education in many parts in the world where it is in crisis.

The editor has spent several years searching for the most reputable statisticians all over the world. International contributors are either presidents of the local statistical societies, or head of the Statistics department at the main university, or the most distinguished statisticians in their countries. b) to enable any non-statistician to obtain quick and yet comprehensive and highly understandable view on certain statistical term, method or application c) to enable all the researchers, managers and practicioners to refresh their knowledge in Statistics, especially in certain controversial fields. d) to revive interest in statistics among students, since they will see its usefulness and relevance in almost all branches of Science.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Human-Centered AI', 'abstract': 'Abstract Researchers, developers, business leaders, policy makers, and others are expanding the technology-centered scope of artificial intelligence (AI) to include human-centered AI (HCAI) ways of thinking. This expansion from an algorithm-focused view to embrace a human-centered perspective can shape the future of technology so as to better serve human needs. Educators, designers, software engineers, product managers, evaluators, and government agency staffers can build on AI-driven technologies to design products and services that make life better for people and enable people to care for each other. Humans have always been tool builders, and now they are supertool builders, whose inventions can improve our health, family life, education, business, the environment, and much more. The remarkable progress in algorithms for machine and deep learning have opened the doors to new opportunities, and some dark possibilities. However, a bright future awaits AI researchers, developers, business leaders, policy makers, and others who build on their working methods by including HCAI strategies of design and testing. This enlarged vision can shape the future of technology so as to better serve human needs.

At the same time, data-driven technologies influence our lives in all areas and have caused fundamental economical and societal changes. This study presents a comprehensive literature review on how data-driven approaches have enabled or inhibited the successful achievement of the 17 SDGs to date. Our findings show that data-driven analytics and tools contribute to achieving the 17 SDGs, e.g., by making information more reliable, supporting better-informed decision-making, implementing data-based policies, prioritizing actions, and optimizing the allocation of resources. Based on a qualitative content analysis, results were aggregated into a conceptual framework, including the following categories: (1) uses of data-driven methods (e.g., monitoring, measurement, mapping or modeling, forecasting, risk assessment, and planning purposes), (2) resulting positive effects, (3) arising challenges, and (4) recommendations for action to overcome these challenges. Despite positive effects and versatile applications, problems such as data gaps, data biases, high energy consumption of computational resources, ethical concerns, privacy, ownership, and security issues stand in the way of achieving the 17 SDGs.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "title": "Incorporating Explainability Frameworks in LLMs for Legal Text Analysis: Research Landscape Map",
    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem addressed by the research cluster is the challenge of improving trustworthiness and interpretability of AI models—especially complex machine learning models like large language models (LLMs)—through explainability frameworks, to enable responsible deployment in domains such as legal text analysis. The central nodes reveal a focus on explainable AI (XAI) techniques, algorithmic machine learning, and AI technology as critical foundations, alongside the concept of citizen science indicating stakeholder involvement and interdisciplinary collaboration. Thematic islands cluster into fields around (1) scientific endeavors and citizen science, suggesting human-centered participatory approaches; (2) AI technology and machine learning emergence, focusing on algorithmic and model development challenges; and (3) XAI techniques and AI models, emphasizing methods to interpret black-box models. Dominant methods include taxonomy and categorization of explainability approaches (e.g., post-hoc explainability, model explainability), evaluation and assessment metrics for explanations, human-centered design to tailor explanations to different users, and frameworks for trustworthy AI integrating transparency, fairness, and accountability across the AI lifecycle. These paradigms frame explainability not merely as a technical problem but as a multi-stakeholder issue intersecting technical, ethical, and societal dimensions, critical for domains like legal text analysis where interpretability and trust are paramount.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: The curated papers lack identified bridge nodes connecting thematic clusters, signaling an internal siloing between citizen science approaches, AI technology development, and XAI techniques. Existing literature states limitations including insufficient tailored explainability methods for domain-specific contexts (e.g., legal texts), limited evaluation frameworks for explanation effectiveness, and challenges in integrating explainability with fairness and accountability principles in complex models. Moreover, practical deployment, especially in high-stakes areas, remains underexplored, with a call for responsible AI methodologies that balance model performance and human interpretability.\n\nExternal/Novel Gaps: The global GPS analysis reveals hidden bridges connecting 'scientific endeavor' and 'algorithmic machine learning' with legal studies and public administration domains, and between 'field of XAI' and psychological/health sciences emphasizing human cognition, user-centered design, and decision support systems. Also, connections to human-computer interaction, interactive machine learning, and natural language processing techniques exist but are underutilized locally. Critically, concepts like 'user model,' 'veil of ignorance' from legal philosophy, and 'decision support systems' from healthcare provide opportunities to enhance explainability frameworks by embedding user-centric legal decision contexts. Additionally, incorporating cognitive insights from psychology and employing interactive, adaptive explanation methods can address current explainability evaluation and usability gaps. These interdisciplinary approaches are overlooked by the existing papers but could significantly advance explainability in legal AI applications.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate user-centered design principles and cognitive psychology insights from the 'field of XAI' and human cognition clusters with current XAI techniques to create adaptive explanation interfaces tailored for diverse legal stakeholders (judges, lawyers, litigants). This addresses the internal gap of one-size-fits-all explanations and enhances trust and usability.\n\nOpportunity 2: Leverage the 'scientific endeavor' and 'algorithmic machine learning' connection with public administration and legal studies by developing legal domain-specific interactive machine learning frameworks that incorporate 'veil of ignorance' principles. This would promote fairness-aware explainability aligned with legal ethics and public decision-making, addressing gaps in combining fairness, accountability, and explainability.\n\nOpportunity 3: Combine natural language processing advancements and explainability algorithms (e.g., Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), Grad-CAM adapted for text) with citizen science-driven participatory approaches to crowdsourcing explanation validation and refinement. This would bridge the gap between technical model explanations and real-world legal interpretability requirements, enabling scalable, collaborative improvement of legal AI systems' transparency."
