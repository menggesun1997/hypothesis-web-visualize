    "title": "GreenAI Behavioral Nudges: Motivational Messaging to Reduce LLM Training Footprint",
    "Problem_Statement": "AI practitioners lack incentive-driven frameworks applying behavioral science to promote environmentally responsible training choices, resulting in persistent high-energy training practices.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the novel external gap of applying social and health sciences behavioral intervention concepts to AI training. Combines motivational messaging and activity self-efficacy theories to create a community-driven green AI adoption strategy, an unexplored cross-disciplinary innovation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design and deploy a GreenAI behavioral intervention platform integrated into AI training environments. The system delivers motivational messages, progress feedback, and social norm cues encouraging energy-efficient training decisions (e.g., reducing epochs, pruning models). It leverages activity self-efficacy concepts and measures practitionersâ€™ environmental impact awareness through surveys and training logs. Peer comparison and gamification elements promote community engagement and sustained green behavior.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop platform prototype integrated with popular ML tools.\n2. Recruit AI researchers and engineers to participate in a controlled study.\n3. Randomly assign participants to control and intervention groups.\n4. Collect training log data, energy consumption metrics, and survey responses.\n5. Analyze changes in energy-efficient training behaviors and motivation levels.\n6. Refine messaging strategies based on feedback.\n7. Longer-term studies on adoption rates in organizations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI engineer initiates model training; receives message: 'Reducing training epochs by 10% this week can save X kg CO2-eq! Join peers in the GreenAI movement!'\nOutput: Engineer adjusts training configuration, receives positive progress feedback, feeling motivated to continue green practices.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If motivational messages show limited effect, implement more direct incentive mechanisms such as energy usage badges or organizational recognition programs. Utilize qualitative interviews to understand barriers and redesign messaging accordingly."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that motivational messaging and social norm cues alone can meaningfully shift entrenched AI training behaviors may be overly optimistic. AI practitioners often face strict performance and deadline pressures, which may outweigh environmental concerns despite messaging efforts. The proposal should explicitly justify why such behavioral interventions would overcome these strong extrinsic incentives and detail potential confounders that might diminish effect sizes, such as institutional policies or hardware constraints. Considering these, the approach could add robust theoretical backing or preliminary data illustrating motivation-behavior coupling in this specific context before large-scale deployment is warranted. This will improve the soundness and grounding of the intervention strategy beyond plausible wishful thinking about motivation-driven behavior change in technical domains like LLM training environments. Suggestions include piloting with small groups or leveraging existing behavioral science frameworks explicitly tailored to professional contexts marked by competing priorities and incentives, such as AI research labs or industry teams with sustainability goals but tight delivery cycles. Also better integrating these complexities will enhance the persuasiveness and real-world applicability of the assumption underpinning the platform's core design and its envisioned effect on training energy consumption reduction. This is essential to establish a credible chain from motivational messaging to actual energy-efficient training practice change, as claimed in the problem statement and method sections (Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan lacks detail on critical design elements ensuring scientific rigor and practical feasibility. For example, it does not specify the sample size estimation methodology for recruiting AI researchers and engineers, nor exact criteria for randomization and blinding, raising concerns about statistical power and bias control. Furthermore, the plan omits mention of technologies or frameworks for measuring energy consumption quantitatively and reliably across diverse hardware and training configurations, which is crucial to validating the impact. Additionally, there is insufficient consideration for participant diversity (e.g., industry vs. academia, different model types and sizes), which affects generalizability and interpretability. Finally, the longer-term adoption studies are vaguely defined without a timeline or success metrics. To strengthen feasibility, the proposal should incorporate comprehensive experimental protocol details, including power analysis, participant recruitment strategies ensuring sample representativeness, validated energy monitoring solutions, and well-defined primary and secondary outcome measures with statistical analysis plans. This will substantially boost confidence that the study outcomes will be robust, reproducible, and informative for iterative platform refinement and eventual broader deployment, aligning with the ambitions stated in the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section."
