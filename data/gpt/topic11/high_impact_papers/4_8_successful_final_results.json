        "title": "User Trust Modeling and Enhancement through Explainability-Driven, Cognitive Load-Aware Feedback in LLM Social Media Moderation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Low user trust in AI-moderated social media content undermines platform legitimacy and user engagement, yet current approaches insufficiently capture nuanced trust dynamics or systematically leverage personalized explainability within real-world moderation pipelines. Existing trust models often lack integration of human cognitive and decision-making factors, resulting in suboptimal transparency and acceptance.",
        "Motivation": "Despite extensive research on AI trust and explainability, few solutions holistically integrate psychological theories, human decision-making, and human-computer interaction insights to tailor moderation explanations dynamically. This work addresses this gap by embedding cognitive load theory and adaptive learning system principles to personalize explanation complexity and style based on real-time user engagement and preferences. By incorporating these interdisciplinary elements, our approach aims to provide a novel, reproducible trust modeling framework that meaningfully enhances transparency and users' acceptance of LLM-driven content moderation beyond existing state-of-the-art methods.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-component system combining (1) a computational user trust model grounded in psychological theories of trust and informed by human decision-making research; (2) an explainability feedback subsystem that dynamically personalizes explanation content and complexity using cognitive load metrics derived from real-time user interaction signals (e.g., response latency, clicks, explicit feedback); and (3) a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to optimize explanation adaptation to maximize trust and satisfaction.\n\nSpecifically, the RL agent's state space encodes user trust scores obtained via a trust prediction model—implemented as a recurrent neural network capturing temporal user feedback and behavioral proxies—and cognitive load indicators extracted from interaction data. Action space consists of selecting explanation modalities varying in detail, complexity, and presentation style, guided by an interface designed according to human-computer interaction best practices. The reward function quantitatively combines explicit user trust feedback (Likert-scale ratings post-explanation), implicit behavioral signals (continued platform engagement, appeal rates), and reduced cognitive overload metrics.\n\nIntegration with existing LLM moderation pipelines is achieved by intercepting flagged content moderation decisions and inserting the adaptive explanation system as a modular layer. The trust model’s interpretability is ensured through attention visualization on key features and periodic model audits. Algorithmic sketches, including pseudo-code for the RL policy update and trust score computation, support reproducibility and technical soundness.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Conduct multi-phase user studies to collect interaction data capturing trust signals, cognitive load measures (e.g., interaction latency, mouse movement), and explicit user preferences regarding explanation styles.\n2. Develop and validate the recurrent neural network–based computational trust model to predict trust trajectories over time.\n3. Design and implement the adaptive explanation feedback subsystem, incorporating user interface designs informed by human-computer interaction research to optimize usability and acceptance.\n4. Train the reinforcement learning agent using human-in-the-loop simulations and pilot user studies to adapt explanations optimizing combined trust and cognitive load rewards.\n5. Integrate the system with an LLM-powered moderation pipeline in a controlled experimental environment.\n6. Evaluate trust enhancement, satisfaction, and reduced cognitive overload through mixed-method assessments including surveys, behavioral analytics, and qualitative interviews.\n7. Iterate design based on user feedback and model performance to refine trust prediction accuracy and explanation personalization effectiveness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user-post flagged by LLM moderation is removed, triggering the adaptive explanation system.\n\nScenario: The RL agent selects a concise, context-rich, jargon-free explanation tailored to the user’s prior trust score and cognitive load indicators (e.g., user recently showed signs of disengagement).\n\nPost-explanation: The user provides positive explicit feedback via a trust rating interface, resulting in an increased trust score within the model.\n\nSubsequent interactions: Explanations evolve to incorporate more detailed rationale if the user exhibits increased engagement and willingness to read longer texts, as learned by the RL agent.\n\nOutcome: The system demonstrates measurable increases in trust metrics, user satisfaction, and overall moderation acceptance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive explanations using RL prove ineffective or infeasible, fallback strategies include deploying standardized, empirically validated trust-building explanation templates combined with established human-computer interaction strategies for clarity and accessibility. Additionally, users will be segmented based on trust vulnerability profiles inferred from initial studies, enabling targeted interventions such as simplified explanations for cognitively overloaded users or direct human appeal avenues. Continuous monitoring will guide whether modular upgrades towards adaptive systems can be iteratively deployed in future versions."

For instance, how exactly will the reinforcement learning agent represent states, actions, and rewards? How will user feedback be quantitatively captured and linked to trust signals? Greater specificity is needed on the model architecture, interpretability of trust scores, and the practical integration with existing LLM moderation pipelines to assure soundness and reproducibility. Concrete algorithmic sketches or preliminary system design would strengthen the proposal's technical credibility and clarity for reviewers and implementers alike. Clarify and detail these mechanisms in the Proposed_Method to improve soundness and feasibility of the approach, reducing ambiguity and assumptions about implementation complexity and user modeling fidelity. This will also help justify choices around explainability modalities and adaptive explanation personalization effectively in a socio-technical context. Target Section: Proposed_Method."

For example, incorporating cognitive load theory to dynamically tailor explanation complexity based on real-time user engagement signals can make the feedback more effective and personalized. Additionally, leveraging advances from 'human-computer interaction research' to shape user interface design for trust feedback loops would enhance overall usability and acceptance. This multi-disciplinary integration can differentiate the approach, broaden impact beyond social media moderation, and position it uniquely in the competitive landscape.
