    "title": "Federated Differentially Private LLM Ensemble for Real-Time Financial Risk Prediction",
    "Problem_Statement": "Contemporary federated learning models for financial LLMs struggle with balancing strong differential privacy guarantees and maintaining high accuracy for risk prediction tasks, especially in real-time, privacy-sensitive environments.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal research gap combining federated learning, differential privacy, and real-time financial services. Proposes a novel ensemble learning architecture that dynamically adapts privacy budgets and individual model contributions to optimize joint accuracy and privacy on sensitive financial data in decentralized settings.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct an ensemble of federated LLMs where each participant node applies differentially private noise calibrated based on local data sensitivity. A privacy-budget-aware orchestrator dynamically weights each model's outputs in ensemble predictions to maximize utility without breaching global privacy constraints. Real-time feedback from financial risk monitors refines noise parameters and ensemble composition during deployment.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Simulate multiple financial institutions each with private data subsets; 2) Train local LLMs with varying ε-differential privacy levels; 3) Build ensemble prediction system integrating output confidence scores and privacy budgets; 4) Test on real-world financial risk datasets; 5) Evaluate model accuracy, privacy leakage, latency, and regulatory compliance; 6) Conduct sensitivity analysis of privacy-utility trade-offs.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Financial transaction time series from multiple banks; Output: Combined risk score for loan default prediction with certified privacy guarantees and explainable ensemble contribution weights.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If ensemble weighting degrades performance, explore model distillation into a single differentially private LLM or adaptive federated aggregation strategies. If privacy budgets are too restrictive, investigate relaxed privacy notions (e.g., Rényi DP)."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method introduces an ensemble of federated LLMs with dynamically adapted privacy budgets and orchestrated ensemble weighting. However, the description lacks clarity on how the orchestrator securely obtains and integrates the local privacy budgets without violating privacy guarantees or introducing communication overhead that undermines real-time performance. Also, the method does not explicitly address how differential privacy noise calibration is performed at each node in the presence of heterogeneous data distributions or model architectures, which are common in federated learning scenarios. Strengthening the explanation with detailed algorithmic steps or formal definitions about privacy-budget-aware weighting and noise adaptation would improve soundness and reproducibility of the method, especially given the real-time constraints in sensitive financial environments. Consider a clear protocol for synchronization, responsiveness to feedback, and privacy accounting mechanisms that align with global privacy guarantees, which currently appear under-specified, risking optimistic assumptions about privacy-utility trade-offs and system stability under deployment conditions in finance sectors. This gap may impair trust in privacy assurances and limit adoption in regulatory contexts, which are central to the motivation and problem statement sections. Providing formal proofs or empirical justification for the privacy budget orchestration will enhance confidence in the method's soundness and feasibility substantially.

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan is well structured but lacks details that ensure feasibility and scientific robustness in a real-world federated setting. For instance, the plan should clarify how realistic the simulated data distributions are, especially heterogeneity and non-IID nature of financial data across institutions, which crucially affects federated learning performance. Testing only on real-world datasets without demonstrating robustness to federated constraints like variable client participation, communication delays, and asynchronous updates weakens practical feasibility claims. Latency and real-time feedback mechanisms must be benchmarked considering production-grade infrastructure or at least emulated network and system delays to demonstrate operational viability. Additionally, regulatory compliance evaluation is noted but not detailed—specify which regulations and how compliance is quantitatively or qualitatively assessed to anchor claims. If using classical loan default datasets, provide rationale for their suitability to this challenging, privacy-constrained federated ensemble scenario. Lastly, contingency fallback plans are proposed but should be tested experimentally within the plan to demonstrate adaptability and resilience, a key feasibility component. Expanding these aspects will transform the experiment plan into a robust blueprint for convincing empirical validation. (Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)"
