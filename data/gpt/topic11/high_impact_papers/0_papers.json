    "abstract": "Widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is substantially affecting the human condition in ways that are not yet well understood. Negative unintended consequences abound including the perpetuation and exacerbation of societal inequalities and divisions via algorithmic decision making. We present six grand challenges for the scientific community to create AI technologies that are human-centered, that is, ethical, fair, and enhance the human condition. These grand challenges are the result of an international collaboration across academia, industry and government and represent the consensus views of a group of 26 experts in the field of human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI). In essence, these challenges advocate for a human-centered approach to AI that (1) is centered in human well-being, (2) is designed responsibly, (3) respects privacy, (4) follows human-centered design principles, (5) is subject to appropriate governance and oversight, and (6) interacts with individuals while respecting humanâ€™s cognitive capacities. We hope that these challenges and their associated research directions serve as a call for action to conduct research and development in AI that serves as a force multiplier towards more fair, equitable and sustainable societies.",

    "abstract": "<p>\n                    In the past few decades, economic analysis of law has been challenged by a growing body of experimental and empirical studies that attest to prevalent and systematic deviations from the assumptions of economic rationality. While the findings on bounded rationality and heuristics and biases were initially perceived as antithetical to standard economic and legal-economic analysis, over time they have been largely integrated into mainstream economic analysis, including economic analysis of law. Moreover, the impact of behavioral insights has long since transcended purely economic analysis of law: in recent years, the behavioral movement has become one of the most influential developments in legal scholarship in general.\n                    Behavioral Law and Economics\n                    offers a state-of-the-art overview of the field. The book surveys the entire body of psychological research underpinning behavioral analysis of law, and critically evaluates the core methodological questions of this area of research. The book then discusses the fundamental normative questions stemming from the psychological findings on bounded rationality, and explores their implications for establishing the aims of legislation, and the means of attaining them. This is followed by a systematic and critical examination of the contributions of behavioral studies to all major fields of lawâ€”property, contracts, consumer protection, torts, corporate, securities regulation, antitrust, administrative, constitutional, international, criminal, and evidence lawâ€”as well as to the behavior of key players in the legal arena: litigants and judicial decision-makers.\n                  </p>",

    "abstract": "A remarkable time of human promise has been ushered in by the convergence of the ever-expanding availability of big data, the soaring speed and stretch of cloud computing platforms, and the advancement of increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms. Innovations in AI are already leaving a mark on government by improving the provision of essential social goods and services from healthcare, education, and transportation to food supply, energy, and environmental management. These bounties are likely just the start. The prospect that progress in AI will help government to confront some of its most urgent challenges is exciting, but legitimate worries abound. As with any new and rapidly evolving technology, a steep learning curve means that mistakes and miscalculations will be made and that both unanticipated and harmful impacts will occur.This guide, written for department and delivery leads in the UK public sector and adopted by the British Government in its publication, 'Using AI in the Public Sector,' identifies the potential harms caused by AI systems and proposes concrete, operationalisable measures to counteract them. It stresses that public sector organisations can anticipate and prevent these potential harms by stewarding a culture of responsible innovation and by putting in place governance processes that support the design and implementation of ethical, fair, and safe AI systems. It also highlights the need for algorithmically supported outcomes to be interpretable by their users and made understandable to decision subjects in clear, non-technical, and accessible ways. Finally, it builds out a vision of human-centred and context-sensitive implementation that gives a central role to communication, evidence-based reasoning, situational awareness, and moral justifiability.",

    "abstract": "The United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out to improve the quality of life of people in developed, emerging, and developing countries by covering social and economic aspects, with a focus on environmental sustainability. At the same time, data-driven technologies influence our lives in all areas and have caused fundamental economical and societal changes. This study presents a comprehensive literature review on how data-driven approaches have enabled or inhibited the successful achievement of the 17 SDGs to date. Our findings show that data-driven analytics and tools contribute to achieving the 17 SDGs, e.g., by making information more reliable, supporting better-informed decision-making, implementing data-based policies, prioritizing actions, and optimizing the allocation of resources. Based on a qualitative content analysis, results were aggregated into a conceptual framework, including the following categories: (1) uses of data-driven methods (e.g., monitoring, measurement, mapping or modeling, forecasting, risk assessment, and planning purposes), (2) resulting positive effects, (3) arising challenges, and (4) recommendations for action to overcome these challenges. Despite positive effects and versatile applications, problems such as data gaps, data biases, high energy consumption of computational resources, ethical concerns, privacy, ownership, and security issues stand in the way of achieving the 17 SDGs.",

    "year": 2021,

    "fieldCitationRatio": 108.62,
    "abstract": "AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., BERT,\nDALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a\nwide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to\nunderscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report\nprovides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation\nmodels, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics,\nreasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model\narchitectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation,\ntheory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal\nimpact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and\nethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep\nlearning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent\ncapabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes\nhomogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution,\nas the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models\ndownstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models,\nwe currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and\nwhat they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these\nquestions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will\nrequire deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their\nfundamentally sociotechnical nature.",

In this Perspective, we outline fairness in machine learning through the lens of healthcare, and discuss how algorithmic biases (in data acquisition, genetic variation and intra-observer labelling variability, in particular) arise in clinical workflows and the resulting healthcare disparities. We also review emerging technology for mitigating biases via disentanglement, federated learning and model explainability, and their role in the development of AI-based software as a medical device.",

    "abstract": "Over the past century, educational psychologists and researchers have posited many theories to explain how individuals learn, i.e. how they acquire, organize and deploy knowledge and skills.Â The 20th century can be considered the century of psychology on learning and related fields of interest (such as motivation, cognition, metacognition etc.) and it is fascinating to see the various mainstreams of learning, remembered and forgotten over the 20th century andÂ note that basic assumptions of early theories survived several paradigm shifts of psychology and epistemology. Beyond folk psychology and its naÃ¯ve theories of learning, psychological learning theories can be grouped into some basic categories, such as behaviorist learning theories, connectionist learning theories, cognitive learning theories, constructivist learning theories, and social learning theories. Learning theories are not limited to psychology and related fields of interest but rather we can find the topic of learning in various disciplines, such as philosophy and epistemology, education, information science, biology, and â€“ as a result of the emergence of computer technologies â€“ especially also in the field of computer sciences and artificial intelligence. As a consequence, machine learning struck a chord in the 1980s and became an important field of the learning sciences in general. As the learning sciencesÂ became more specialized and complex, the various fields of interest were widely spread and separated from each other; as a consequence, even presently, there is no comprehensive overview ofÂ theÂ sciences of learning or the central theoretical concepts and vocabulary on which researchers rely.Â Â  The Encyclopedia of theÂ Sciences of LearningÂ provides an up-to-date, broad and authoritative coverage of the specific terms mostly used in the sciences of learning and its related fields, including relevant areas of instruction,pedagogy, cognitive sciences, and especially machine learning and knowledge engineering. This modern compendium will be an indispensable source of information for scientists, educators, engineers, and technical staff active in all fields of learning. More specifically, the EncyclopediaÂ  provides fast access to the most relevant theoretical termsÂ provides up-to-date, broad and authoritative coverage of the most important theories within the various fields of the learning sciences and adjacent sciences and communication technologies; supplies clear and precise explanations of the theoretical terms, cross-references to related entries and up-to-date references to important research and publications. TheÂ Encyclopedia also contains biographical entries ofÂ individuals who have substantially contributed to the sciences of learning; the entries are written by a distinguished panel of researchers in the various fields of the learning sciences.",

    "abstract": "The OECD Science, Technology and Innovation Outlook 2018 is the twelfth edition in a series that biennially reviews key trends in science, technology and innovation (STI) policy in OECD countries and a number of major partner economies. The 14 chapters within this edition look at a range of topics, notably the opportunities and challenges related to enhanced data access, the impacts of artificial intelligence on science and manufacturing, and the influence of digitalisation on research and innovation. The report also discusses the shortcomings of current policy measures, how the Sustainable Development Goals are re-shaping STI policy agendas, and the need for new - more flexible and agile - approaches to technology governance and policy design. While these disruptive changes challenge policy makers in a number of ways, the digital revolution underway also provides solutions for better policy targeting, implementation and monitoring.This report relies on the latest academic work in the field, research and innovation statistical data, as well as data on wider trends and issues. It makes extensive use of country responses to the 2017 EC OECD STI policy survey (https://stip.oecd.org) and features contributions by renowned experts and academics to broaden the debate and provide more personal, sometimes controversial, angles to it.",

    "year": 2023,
    "citationCount": 32,
    "fieldCitationRatio": 63.81,
    "abstract": "As generative language models, exemplified by ChatGPT, continue to advance in their capabilities, the spotlight on biases inherent in these models intensifies. This article delves into the distinctive challenges and risks associated with biases specifically in large-scale language models. We explore the origins of biases, stemming from factors such as training data, model specifications, algorithmic constraints, product design, and policy decisions. Our examination extends to the ethical implications arising from the unintended consequences of biased model outputs. In addition, we analyze the intricacies of mitigating biases, acknowledging the inevitable persistence of some biases, and consider the consequences of deploying these models across diverse applications, including virtual assistants, content generation, and chatbots. Finally, we provide an overview of current approaches for identifying, quantifying, and mitigating biases in language models, underscoring the need for a collaborative, multidisciplinary effort to craft AI systems that embody equity, transparency, and responsibility. This article aims to catalyze a thoughtful discourse within the AI community, prompting researchers and developers to consider the unique role of biases in the domain of generative language models and the ongoing quest for ethical AI.",
