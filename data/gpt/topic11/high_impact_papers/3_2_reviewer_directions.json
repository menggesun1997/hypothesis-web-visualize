    "title": "Blockchain-Enabled Immutable Audit Trails for AI Training Environmental Impact",
    "Problem_Statement": "Tracking and auditing the environmental impact of large AI model training lacks transparency and immutability, decreasing trust and accountability among stakeholders.",
    "Motivation": "This idea directly expands on the high-potential innovation opportunity of employing blockchain and privacy-enhancing tech to track training energy and carbon footprints, bridging Facebook research and XAI insights. It introduces a verifiable, decentralized environmental accountability framework.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a blockchain-based protocol that logs detailed AI training metadata including energy consumption, carbon impact estimates, training duration, and hardware specs. Smart contracts enforce privacy-preserving data submission and enable third-party auditing. The system interfaces with ML platforms to automatically generate tamper-proof environmental impact certificates for every training run, accessible to regulators, researchers, and the public for transparency and fairness assessment.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Design blockchain schema optimized for AI training impact data.\n2. Integrate smart contracts with energy sensors and ML pipelines.\n3. Pilot on varied LLM training workloads.\n4. Evaluate system scalability, data privacy, and audit effectiveness.\n5. Conduct stakeholder user studies on trust and usability.\n6. Compare with conventional environmental reporting schemes.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Training run completes; environmental metrics uploaded to blockchain.\nOutput: Immutable certification timestamped on the ledger, verifiable by third parties, showing precise CO2 emission data and hardware energy use linked to training hash.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain overhead is prohibitive, explore hybrid decentralized ledger technologies or distributed timestamping schemes. Develop stronger anonymization methods to alleviate privacy concerns. Alternatively, implement centralized but cryptographically verifiable audit logs."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-MECHANISM",
          "feedback_content": "While the high-level concept of using blockchain to log AI training environmental impact is promising, the description of the Proposed_Method lacks clarity on how privacy-preserving data submission will be technically enforced and how the system guarantees scalability and real-time data integration with diverse ML frameworks. Additionally, it is not explicit how the smart contracts interact with external energy sensors and handle potential data authenticity or sensor tampering issues. The mechanism should be elaborated with concrete technical designs or architectures to ensure soundness and feasibility before proceeding to implementation stages, especially given blockchain’s performance and storage constraints for detailed metrics logging at scale, which may be considerable during large LLM trainings.\nSuggestions: Include a detailed data flow diagram, specify which blockchain platform or consensus mechanism is planned, elaborate on privacy enhancements (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs) and how third-party audits verify data correctness without compromising privacy or efficiency. Clarify fallback integration times and costs to strengthen the design’s robustness and credibility, and discuss security threats and mitigations for data integrity beyond immutability alone. This will help validate the method’s technical viability and soundness clearly. \n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and the idea's focus on blockchain-based environmental auditing for AI training, it is recommended to integrate concepts from the globally-linked topics such as 'trust management' and 'Edge and Fog computing' to substantially enhance impact and novelty. Specifically, propose a hybrid system where edge computing devices at AI training sites collect energy usage and environmental metrics locally, perform preliminary privacy-preserving aggregation or anonymization, and then interface with a blockchain ledger for immutable logging and trust management. This reduces blockchain overhead and latency while leveraging trusted edge devices as intermediate nodes.\nFurthermore, coupling the framework with explainable AI (XAI) components to interpret the environmental impact data might increase transparency and stakeholder trust, drawing from the motivation links. Extending the idea into domains like healthcare or smart hospital AI training energy audits could broaden application impact and attract interdisciplinary interest, aligning with modern healthcare information systems noted in the linked concepts.\n\nTarget section: Title and Proposed_Method"
