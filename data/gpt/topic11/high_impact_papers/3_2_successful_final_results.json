        "title": "Hybrid Edge-Blockchain Framework for Privacy-Preserving Immutable Audit Trails of AI Training Environmental Impact in Smart Healthcare Systems",
        "Problem_Statement": "Transparent, immutable, and privacy-preserving auditing of environmental impacts of large AI model training remains challenging due to diverse data sources, lack of integrated trust management, scalability constraints of blockchain, and the need for domain-specific adoption such as healthcare AI. Existing methods lack robust architectures that address real-time data integration, sensor trustworthiness, and scalable privacy compliance simultaneously.",
        "Motivation": "Building on the promising but competitive area of blockchain-enabled environmental auditing, this proposal advances prior work by integrating edge computing and trust management to manage sensor data securely and scalably while enhancing privacy via zero-knowledge proofs and explainable AI techniques. Targeting smart healthcare systems as a high-impact domain besides general AI training expands applicability and interdisciplinary interest. This hybrid approach innovatively balances blockchainâ€™s immutability with edge-level data aggregation to reduce ledger overhead and latency, enabling real-time, trustworthy certification of AI training energy footprints. The approach introduces a comprehensive technical design that improves on existing solutions, addressing scalability, privacy, and data integrity to foster higher stakeholder trust and regulatory readiness.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid system architecture combining trusted edge computing nodes with a permissioned blockchain ledger for immutable logging and auditability of AI training environmental metrics, specifically optimized for smart healthcare AI trainings.\n\n1. **Data Collection and Local Aggregation:** Edge nodes deployed at AI training sites interface directly with calibrated energy sensors and hardware monitors, collecting raw energy usage, CO2 estimates, training hyperparameters, and hardware specs. Edge nodes perform privacy-preserving aggregation and anonymization using techniques such as homomorphic encryption and differential privacy to protect sensitive operational details.\n\n2. **Trust Management and Sensor Integrity:** Each edge node incorporates a secure TPM (Trusted Platform Module) capable of attesting to sensor authenticity and data integrity via remote attestation protocols. Anomalous data patterns or sensor tampering attempts trigger alerts and quarantines.\n\n3. **Blockchain Ledger and Smart Contracts:** A permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric using Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus) stores cryptographic commitments of aggregated environmental impact data alongside verifiable metadata fingerprints (hashes) of training runs. Smart contracts enforce data submission rules, privacy constraints via integrated zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs), and automate issuance of immutable, tamper-proof environmental impact certificates.\n\n4. **Real-Time Integration with ML Frameworks:** The system provides standardized APIs and middleware adapters enabling seamless real-time data streaming from diverse ML platforms (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to edge nodes, ensuring up-to-date logging without disrupting training workflows.\n\n5. **Explainable Environmental Impact Analytics:** An explainable AI module interprets logged data to generate stakeholder-friendly reports highlighting key energy contributors, carbon footprint breakdowns, and suggestions for environmentally efficient training practices, increasing transparency and trust.\n\n6. **Scalability and Cost Optimizations:** Batch aggregation at edges minimizes on-chain data storage, while timestamping and digest pointers ensure verifiable audit trails without excessive ledger bloat. The hybrid system thus balances scalability with immutable provenance.\n\n7. **Fallback and Hybrid Integration:** If performance issues arise, the framework supports fallback to distributed timestamping services (e.g., OpenTimestamps) and cryptographically verifiable centralized logs, maintaining audit guarantees incrementally.\n\nThis design cohesively addresses privacy, scalability, authenticity, and transparency challenges while innovating through edge-blockchain trust synergy and XAI-driven interpretability, differentiating it fundamentally from prior art.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Design detailed architecture diagrams illustrating data flow, trust anchors, and interfaces between sensors, edge nodes, blockchain, and ML platforms.\n2. Develop and deploy prototype edge node software with integrated sensor attestation, privacy-preserving aggregation, and API middleware.\n3. Implement permissioned blockchain network with smart contracts supporting zk-SNARK integration to enforce privacy and audit compliance.\n4. Connect prototype with ML frameworks performing varied AI training workloads, including large language model training within smart healthcare AI use cases.\n5. Evaluate system performance: latency, throughput, data privacy leakage, blockchain storage costs, and scalability under realistic training loads.\n6. Conduct security analysis focusing on sensor tampering detection efficacy, data integrity under attack scenarios, and robustness of trust management.\n7. Integrate explainable AI impact analysis modules, validate stakeholder usability and trust improvements through controlled user studies involving healthcare professionals, regulators, and AI researchers.\n8. Compare performance and audit efficacy with state-of-the-art centralized and blockchain-only environmental monitoring approaches.\n9. Refine fallback mechanisms for hybrid log management and re-test under failure modes.\n10. Publish datasets, software artifacts, and comprehensive technical documentation to facilitate adoption and reproducibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Completion of a sensitive AI training run at a smart hospital site.\n- Edge node obtains raw energy data from calibrated sensors and running ML pipeline metadata.\n- Edge aggregates and anonymizes data, generates cryptographic commitments.\n- Smart contract validates data submission via zk-SNARK proofs without revealing sensitive details.\n- Immutable certificate with timestamp, aggregated CO2 emissions, and hardware specs anchored on blockchain.\n\nOutput: Publicly verifiable environmental impact certificate, enriched with explainable AI report indicating major energy consumption contributors, accessible to hospital administrators, AI developers, and regulators via a dedicated dashboard.\n\nAdditional test: Sensor tampering attempt triggers remote attestation failure, preventing false data submission and flagging event to audit logs.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain throughput or storage overhead constrains performance under large-scale deployments, fallback to hybrid distributed timestamping services combined with cryptographically verifiable centralized audit logs will be adopted. Stronger anonymization and data minimization at edge nodes can mitigate privacy risks if zero-knowledge proof integration proves computationally taxing. Additionally, a phased deployment focusing on critical AI training sessions within healthcare can lower system load, enabling gradual scaling while preserving immutability and trust guarantees. Alternative permissioned ledgers or lightweight consensus protocols (e.g., Tendermint) may be evaluated for enhanced efficiency."

Additionally, it is not explicit how the smart contracts interact with external energy sensors and handle potential data authenticity or sensor tampering issues. The mechanism should be elaborated with concrete technical designs or architectures to ensure soundness and feasibility before proceeding to implementation stages, especially given blockchainâ€™s performance and storage constraints for detailed metrics logging at scale, which may be considerable during large LLM trainings.\nSuggestions: Include a detailed data flow diagram, specify which blockchain platform or consensus mechanism is planned, elaborate on privacy enhancements (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs) and how third-party audits verify data correctness without compromising privacy or efficiency. Clarify fallback integration times and costs to strengthen the designâ€™s robustness and credibility, and discuss security threats and mitigations for data integrity beyond immutability alone. This will help validate the methodâ€™s technical viability and soundness clearly. \n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"

Specifically, propose a hybrid system where edge computing devices at AI training sites collect energy usage and environmental metrics locally, perform preliminary privacy-preserving aggregation or anonymization, and then interface with a blockchain ledger for immutable logging and trust management. This reduces blockchain overhead and latency while leveraging trusted edge devices as intermediate nodes.\nFurthermore, coupling the framework with explainable AI (XAI) components to interpret the environmental impact data might increase transparency and stakeholder trust, drawing from the motivation links. Extending the idea into domains like healthcare or smart hospital AI training energy audits could broaden application impact and attract interdisciplinary interest, aligning with modern healthcare information systems noted in the linked concepts.\n\nTarget section: Title and Proposed_Method"
