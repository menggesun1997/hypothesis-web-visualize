    "title": "Transparent Interactive Moderation Dashboards Leveraging Advanced XAI and Human-Centered UI Design",
    "Problem_Statement": "Social media moderators and users often face black-box AI moderation decisions, resulting in low trust, misunderstandings, and reduced acceptance of automated moderation. Current explainability tools are fragmented and lack integration with UI designs tailored for diverse user expertise.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap in integrating communication research and XAI via advanced algorithms and UI design to create truly transparent, user-friendly moderation tools. This bridges practical deficits in explainability and accountability by making AI decisions accessible and interactive, improving transparency and trustworthiness.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an interactive moderation dashboard combining state-of-the-art local explainability methods (e.g., LIME, counterfactual explanations) with adaptive UI elements customized for moderator expertise and user roles. Incorporate multi-modal outputs (text highlights, visual graphs, actionable suggestions) that explain the rationale behind each moderation decision. Implement feedback mechanisms for moderators and users to query, contest, and understand AI decisions, fostering co-learning between human and AI agents.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Design and develop the interactive dashboard prototype. 2. Integrate LLM-based moderation systems with embedded XAI modules. 3. Recruit moderators and user participants for scenario-based testing. 4. Measure usability via SUS score, as well as trust and transparency via validated questionnaires. 5. Compare decision accuracy and acceptance rates before and after dashboard introduction. 6. Analyze interaction logs to refine explainability methods and UI flow.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A flagged sarcastic post that the AI classifies as harmful speech. The dashboard highlights sarcastic markers and explains classification uncertainty. The moderator interacts with the interface to review alternative interpretations and can override the decision. User feedback is recorded to improve future moderation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If complexity overwhelms users, simplify dashboards by prioritizing core explanations and offering advanced details on-demand. Alternatively, replace some interactive features with video or chatbot-based explanations to better suit user preferences."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experimental plan is well-structured but lacks clarity on how the integration of the LLM-based moderation system with embedded XAI modules will be validated before user testing. It is important to include preliminary technical validation steps to ensure the explainability outputs are reliable and meaningful in realistic moderation contexts. Additionally, more detail is needed on participant recruitment criteria regarding moderator expertise diversity and user representation to support generalizability of usability and trust measurements. Expanding on these aspects will improve feasibility and robustness of the evaluation framework, ensuring that subsequent usability and impact assessments are grounded on a technically sound system and a representative user sample. Consider also planning iterative development cycles allowing refinement based on early feedback logs before the formal comparative study phase to better ensure system readiness and incremental improvement effectiveness in real-world moderation scenarios, which are typically complex and variable in nature. This will boost confidence in the feasibility and practical applicability of the approach overall, reducing risk of experimental failure due to premature large-scale testing with immature prototypes or unrepresentative user bases. Suggest adding technical validation and iterative pilot study steps explicitly to the experiment plan to enhance feasibility and scientific rigor of the proposed research trajectory.\n\nFurther, explicitly defining quantitative and qualitative criteria for success in the SUS, trust, transparency, decision accuracy, and acceptance rate measurements would improve rigor and clarity of the plan and its ability to provide actionable learnings for future development and deployment of such explainability dashboards in moderation workflows, addressing the real-world complexity moderators face when dealing with nuanced content such as sarcasm or ambiguity, highlighted in the test cases provided.\n\nSummary: include technical validation, clearer participant criteria, iterative pilots, and well-defined success metrics before large-scale user testing to enhance feasibility and reliability of findings in a competitive, real-world relevant domain. This will increase the chance of producing scientifically valid and operationally useful results from the proposed experiments.\n\n[FEA-EXPERIMENT]"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE assessment and the proposal's focus on advanced XAI combined with human-centered UI design for moderation, a key opportunity lies in explicitly integrating concepts from 'human-AI interaction design', 'sociotechnical gaps', and 'Responsible Artificial Intelligence' to strengthen both novelty and impact. Specifically, the proposal could be enhanced by framing the dashboard as part of a sociotechnical system that not only explains AI decisions but dynamically adapts to evolving moderator and user needs through a learner model that captures individual and community-level trust, expertise, and feedback patterns.\n\nThis would position the work within human-centered AI frameworks emphasizing co-learning and model risk management, moving beyond local explainability towards a systemic, interactive intelligence environment for content moderation. Incorporating adaptive interface adaptation informed by continuous interaction logs and user behavior analytics would differentiate the approach in a competitive area and address broader socio-technical challenges around fairness, transparency, and accountability in online moderation, mapping directly to 'Responsible Artificial Intelligence' and 'human-AI interaction research'.\n\nRecommendation: embed adaptive, learner-driven interaction design principles from 'human-computer interaction research' and 'design of intelligent environments' to create a feedback-loop moderated explainability ecosystem that evolves transparently with community trust and risk mitigation goals. This global integration will boost research novelty, practical relevance, and downstream impact by addressing multilayered human-AI collaboration complexities in content moderationâ€”a phenomenon of global interest.\n\nSuch an approach could also connect to related domains like 'detecting disinformation' and safeguarding 'non-technical end users', thereby broadening the impact scope and aligning with emerging challenges in intelligent environments and AI frameworks.\n\n[SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION]"
