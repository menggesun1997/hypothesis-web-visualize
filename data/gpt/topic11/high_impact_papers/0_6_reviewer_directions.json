    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs in healthcare lack dynamic prompt mechanisms that embed legal and economic context to steer bias-mitigated responses effectively.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the gap of incorporating legal-economic analyses into AI fairness by innovating prompt engineering that dynamically adjusts LLM behavior towards compliant, fair outputs based on behavioral law insights, linked to Opportunity 1.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a context-aware prompt engineering framework that includes economic and legal parameters reflecting patient demographics and health policy constraints. The system generates adaptive prompts during inference to guide LLM outputs toward fairness and policy compliance without retraining.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build prompt templates embedding behavioral law constraints.\n2) Test on healthcare QA and clinical note summarization tasks.\n3) Measure fairness, bias metrics, and compliance against baselines.\n4) Conduct user studies with clinical and legal experts on output appropriateness.\n5) Assess generalization across different healthcare contexts.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical query about treatment recommendations for diverse populations.\nOutput: LLM response reflecting legal fairness and economic considerations guarding against discrimination.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If prompt engineering yields insufficient control, augment with reinforcement learning from human feedback or constrained decoding methods."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method lacks concrete details on how legal and economic parameters will be effectively encoded into prompt templates to dynamically influence LLM outputs. It is unclear how the system handles ambiguities or conflicting constraints from legal and economic contexts during inference, or how these constraints are quantified and integrated without retraining. Providing a clear technical framework or algorithmic approach for incorporating behavioral law constraints into prompt engineering is necessary to assess soundness rigorously and ensure reproducibility and scalability of the approach in real healthcare settings while preserving fairness and compliance guarantees robustly under diverse scenarios, including complex or contradictory policy constraints, is crucial for the method's credibility and usability in practice. Detailed explanations on how adaptive prompts are generated and controlled would strengthen this section significantly. This clarity will also be paramount for reviewers to evaluate whether the mechanism truly guides LLM behavior toward the desired fairness and compliance objectives without unintended biases or oversights, enhancing trust in the proposed approach's soundness and applicability in sensitive healthcare contexts.\n\nSuggested action: Include precise formulation or schema for integrating legal-economic context into prompts, how these prompts are adapted per patient or policy context dynamically at inference time, and how the outputs are monitored or constrained to ensure stability and reliability of fairness and compliance outcomes in real-world tasks such as clinical QA and note summarization."

          "feedback_content": "While the step-by-step experimental plan covers essential fairness and compliance evaluation with expert feedback, it currently lacks detail on operationalizing and measuring legal and economic context adherence in outputs quantitatively beyond general bias and fairness metrics. Clear specification of the fairness and compliance metrics—especially those tied directly to legal and economic constraints and behavioral law theory—is needed to ensure practical feasibility and scientific rigor. This also includes the need for defined benchmarks or datasets that represent diverse patient demographics and health policies to validate generalization claims robustly. Furthermore, contingencies related to complex real-world legal-economic constraints should be anticipated beyond fallback methods; for example, how user studies will be designed to capture nuanced judgments from legal and clinical experts, and what success criteria will dictate iteration or paradigm shifts. Strengthening this plan with concrete, measurable objectives and validation approaches grounded in existing healthcare and legal compliance standards will significantly improve confidence in the experimental setup's feasibility and impact potential. Providing clear criteria for success at each experimental step and integrating domain-specific evaluation protocols will better align the experiments with the proposed framework's goals of bias mitigation and policy compliance without retraining."
