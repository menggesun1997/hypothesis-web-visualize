        "title": "Schema-Guided Contextual Prompt Engineering Incorporating Legal-Economic Constraints for Fair Healthcare LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current healthcare large language models (LLMs) lack a rigorously defined, dynamic prompt engineering mechanism that explicitly integrates quantified legal and economic policy constraints, resulting in outputs that risk unfairness and noncompliance with complex, sometimes conflicting regulatory frameworks. There is a critical need to formalize how contextual behavioral law and economic factors can be encoded and operationalized in prompts to guide LLM outputs toward bias mitigation and policy adherence without costly retraining.",
        "Motivation": "Existing prompt engineering approaches seldom provide a sound, reproducible framework for embedding dynamic, domain-specific legal and economic constraints directly into LLM input prompts that adapt per patient demographics and healthcare policies. This research addresses that gap by developing an algorithmic schema-based prompt construction method that integrates behavioral law insights and economic fairness metrics into conversational AI LLMs, enhancing their interpretability, applicability, and compliance in real-world clinical and policy contexts. By explicitly quantifying and operationalizing constraints, our method advances state-of-the-art prompt engineering beyond static or heuristic techniques, targeting robustness in complex healthcare environments while maintaining scalability and efficiency.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel schema-driven prompt engineering framework that: (1) Formalizes a structured legal-economic context schema capturing behavioral law constraints (e.g., anti-discrimination statutes, privacy mandates) and economic fairness parameters (e.g., resource allocation equity) as quantifiable variables and rule sets. (2) Dynamically instantiates and composes these schema elements into layered prompts tailored to patient characteristics and current health policy contexts at inference time. (3) Employs a two-stage prompt adaptation algorithm—first generating constraint-condition subprompts, then assembling final adaptive prompts via template-driven natural language with constraint tagging to explicitly signal compliance goals to the LLM. (4) Integrates a modular monitoring module that leverages domain-specific fairness and compliance classifiers on LLM outputs, providing real-time feedback for automatic prompt refinement or constrained decoding adjustments to resolve conflicts or ambiguities in legal-economic constraints. (5) Embeds this method within a conversational AI framework inspired by GPT architectures, enabling interactive clarification and iterative compliance checks without retraining the underlying model. This systematic, algorithmic approach ensures reproducibility, scalability, and robust bias mitigation in diverse healthcare scenarios.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct a comprehensive legal-economic context schema by collaborating with healthcare legal experts to encode behavioral law rules and economic fairness metrics into a formalized schema language. 2) Implement the two-stage adaptive prompt generation and constraint-tagging algorithm integrated with a GPT-based conversational AI model for healthcare QA and clinical note summarization. 3) Develop or curate benchmark datasets representing diverse patient demographics and real-world healthcare policies, including clinical queries explicitly sensitive to legal-economic fairness and compliance. 4) Quantitatively evaluate outputs using: (a) traditional fairness and bias metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds), (b) legally-grounded compliance metrics derived from rule adherence scores, and (c) economic fairness indices measuring equitable resource representation in recommendations. 5) Conduct user studies with multidisciplinary panels of clinical practitioners and legal-policy experts using scenario-based assessments and qualitative scoring to capture nuanced judgments of output appropriateness, fairness, and compliance across varying legal-economic complexities. 6) Implement iterative cycles for prompt refinement guided by classifier feedback and user-study insights to address conflicts and ambiguities in constraints. 7) Validate generalization capabilities by applying the framework to distinct healthcare subdomains such as dementia care, assessing robustness and adaptability. 8) Define clear success criteria including quantitative compliance thresholds, statistically significant bias reductions relative to baselines, and expert user acceptance rates above 85%.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Given a patient demographic profile indicating elderly dementia diagnosis and socioeconomic disadvantage, recommend treatment plans while adhering to HIPAA privacy rules, anti-discrimination laws, and equitable economic resource allocation policies in Medicare.\"\nOutput: LLM response that explicitly references legal fairness considerations and economic constraints, articulating treatment recommendations that avoid discriminatory language or suggestions, comply with privacy mandates, and prioritize equitable access to care resources.\n\nInput: Clinical summary prompt embedding conflicting legal mandates (e.g., emergency care legal obligation vs. cost containment economic policies), testing the model’s ability to identify, balance, and transparently communicate conflicts in outputs guided by prompt constraint tagging.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic prompt engineering and constraint tagging alone prove insufficient to guarantee compliance and bias mitigation, the fallback plan involves integrating reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) on flagged outputs combined with constrained decoding techniques that enforce hard constraints during generation. Additionally, we will explore incorporating external symbolic reasoning layers that explicitly validate legal-economic rules post-LM output generation, enabling correction or re-prompting. User studies will inform the necessity and granularity of these interventions to maintain clinical applicability without excessive system complexity."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method lacks concrete details on how legal and economic parameters will be effectively encoded into prompt templates to dynamically influence LLM outputs. It is unclear how the system handles ambiguities or conflicting constraints from legal and economic contexts during inference, or how these constraints are quantified and integrated without retraining. Providing a clear technical framework or algorithmic approach for incorporating behavioral law constraints into prompt engineering is necessary to assess soundness rigorously and ensure reproducibility and scalability of the approach in real healthcare settings while preserving fairness and compliance guarantees robustly under diverse scenarios, including complex or contradictory policy constraints, is crucial for the method's credibility and usability in practice. Detailed explanations on how adaptive prompts are generated and controlled would strengthen this section significantly. This clarity will also be paramount for reviewers to evaluate whether the mechanism truly guides LLM behavior toward the desired fairness and compliance objectives without unintended biases or oversights, enhancing trust in the proposed approach's soundness and applicability in sensitive healthcare contexts.\n\nSuggested action: Include precise formulation or schema for integrating legal-economic context into prompts, how these prompts are adapted per patient or policy context dynamically at inference time, and how the outputs are monitored or constrained to ensure stability and reliability of fairness and compliance outcomes in real-world tasks such as clinical QA and note summarization."

          "feedback_content": "While the step-by-step experimental plan covers essential fairness and compliance evaluation with expert feedback, it currently lacks detail on operationalizing and measuring legal and economic context adherence in outputs quantitatively beyond general bias and fairness metrics. Clear specification of the fairness and compliance metrics—especially those tied directly to legal and economic constraints and behavioral law theory—is needed to ensure practical feasibility and scientific rigor. This also includes the need for defined benchmarks or datasets that represent diverse patient demographics and health policies to validate generalization claims robustly. Furthermore, contingencies related to complex real-world legal-economic constraints should be anticipated beyond fallback methods; for example, how user studies will be designed to capture nuanced judgments from legal and clinical experts, and what success criteria will dictate iteration or paradigm shifts. Strengthening this plan with concrete, measurable objectives and validation approaches grounded in existing healthcare and legal compliance standards will significantly improve confidence in the experimental setup's feasibility and impact potential. Providing clear criteria for success at each experimental step and integrating domain-specific evaluation protocols will better align the experiments with the proposed framework's goals of bias mitigation and policy compliance without retraining."
