        "title": "GreenAI Behavioral Nudges: Empirically Grounded Motivational Messaging to Reduce LLM Training Footprint in Competitive AI Development Environments",
        "Problem_Statement": "AI practitioners often operate under intense performance, deadline, and institutional constraints, which strongly influence their training behaviors. Despite increasing recognition of environmental impacts, there is a lack of empirically grounded, incentive-compatible behavioral frameworks that integrate motivational science with the realities of AI labs to drive meaningful, sustained reductions in energy-intensive LLM training practices. This gap limits progress toward scalable and impactful green AI adoption strategies that respect professional priorities.",
        "Motivation": "While behavioral interventions have shown promise in sustainable behavior change, their application within highly competitive, resource-constrained AI development settings remains underexplored. This proposal advances Cross-Disciplinary GreenAI research by combining robust behavioral science frameworks —specifically Protection Motivation Theory and Self-Determination Theory— with domain-specific constraints, ensuring ecological validity. The innovation lies in rigorously contextualizing motivational messaging to complement, not conflict with, AI practitioners' extrinsic incentives and embedding preliminary pilot data collection to refine assumptions before large-scale deployment. This addresses the competitiveness-validity tradeoff and establishes a replicable methodology for green AI behavioral interventions beyond conceptual novelty.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a modular GreenAI behavioral intervention platform tightly integrated with popular ML training frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow), tailored to reflect AI practitioners' competing priorities. The system will deliver context-sensitive motivational messaging that incorporates social norm cues, self-efficacy boosters, and explicit acknowledgment of deadline and performance pressures, leveraging dual frameworks: Protection Motivation Theory to increase perceived threat and efficacy, and Self-Determination Theory to support autonomous motivation. Initial pilot studies with small teams will inform message calibration. Energy consumption will be monitored via validated frameworks like CodeCarbon and hardware telemetry tools standardized across diverse environments. The platform additionally tracks organizational policies and hardware constraints as covariates. Gamification and peer comparison features respect professional identity and promote sustainable norms without compromising deadlines. The platform includes qualitative modules capturing barriers to action in situ, enabling iterative adaptive messaging. This integrated socio-technical system advances prior messaging-only approaches by substantially anchoring behavior change mechanisms in competitive AI contexts, thereby improving persuasiveness and practicability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Conduct a power analysis based on pilot data to determine a statistically robust sample size balancing industry and academic participants.\n2. Recruit 100+ AI practitioners across academia and industry with diverse roles and training workloads, ensuring representativeness.\n3. Implement stratified randomization with blocking on sector (industry/academia) and model size category, ensuring balanced intervention and control groups.\n4. Blind analysts to group assignment to mitigate assessment bias.\n5. Integrate energy monitoring tools (e.g., CodeCarbon combined with hardware-level telemetry) into participants' training pipelines to collect fine-grained, reliable energy and CO2 emissions data.\n6. Collect baseline data on training behaviors, institutional policies, deadlines, and motivation via validated psychological scales tailored for professional contexts.\n7. Deploy the GreenAI platform with tailored messages acknowledging competing incentives; control group receives neutral system messages.\n8. Collect training log data, energy metrics, and motivation surveys over 8 weeks.\n9. Use mixed-effects models adjusting for confounders such as hardware types, project deadlines, and institutional policies.\n10. Conduct qualitative interviews to explore behavioral barriers and refine messaging.\n11. Define primary outcome as percentage reduction in energy consumption per training run; secondary outcomes include motivation changes and self-reported barriers.\n12. Plan a 6-month follow-up adoption phase, measuring sustained behavioral changes and organizational uptake with defined quantitative thresholds (e.g., consistent 10% energy savings).\n13. Report findings to iteratively improve intervention design and scaling potential.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An AI engineer, mid-project with tight deadlines, begins fine-tuning a large language model. They receive a tailored message: \"Training efficiently now not only saves energy but accelerates deployment—your peers reduced epochs by 15% last week achieving faster results with lower carbon impact! Keep your edge while leading GreenAI.\"\nOutput: The engineer adjusts the training parameters, reducing epochs while monitoring validation metrics, receives weekly positive reinforcement about energy saved and time gained, and expresses increased motivation to continue efficient practices despite time pressure.\n\nInput: A researcher in academia with access to diverse hardware receives a leaderboard update showing department-wide CO2 savings, alongside a prompt emphasizing how collaborative energy reductions enhance both environmental impact and funding competitiveness.\nOutput: The researcher plans model pruning experiments prioritized for energy impact, motivated by peer comparisons and institutional support cues.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If motivational messaging tailored to competing incentives yields limited behavior change, pivot towards integrating direct, multi-level incentives such as organizational green certification badges, inclusion of energy efficiency metrics in project reviews, or funding-linked recognition. Simultaneously, employ deeper qualitative analyses to uncover latent barriers (e.g., hardware inflexibility, deadline rigidity). Explore augmenting messaging with automated training configuration suggestions for energy reduction that minimize manual effort. Consider collaborating with hardware vendors and institutional policymakers to align infrastructure and policy with green AI objectives. If necessary, transition towards mixed interventions combining behavioral, technical, and policy approaches to reinforce sustainable training decisions within high-pressure AI workflows."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that motivational messaging and social norm cues alone can meaningfully shift entrenched AI training behaviors may be overly optimistic. AI practitioners often face strict performance and deadline pressures, which may outweigh environmental concerns despite messaging efforts. The proposal should explicitly justify why such behavioral interventions would overcome these strong extrinsic incentives and detail potential confounders that might diminish effect sizes, such as institutional policies or hardware constraints. Considering these, the approach could add robust theoretical backing or preliminary data illustrating motivation-behavior coupling in this specific context before large-scale deployment is warranted. This will improve the soundness and grounding of the intervention strategy beyond plausible wishful thinking about motivation-driven behavior change in technical domains like LLM training environments. Suggestions include piloting with small groups or leveraging existing behavioral science frameworks explicitly tailored to professional contexts marked by competing priorities and incentives, such as AI research labs or industry teams with sustainability goals but tight delivery cycles. Also better integrating these complexities will enhance the persuasiveness and real-world applicability of the assumption underpinning the platform's core design and its envisioned effect on training energy consumption reduction. This is essential to establish a credible chain from motivational messaging to actual energy-efficient training practice change, as claimed in the problem statement and method sections (Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan lacks detail on critical design elements ensuring scientific rigor and practical feasibility. For example, it does not specify the sample size estimation methodology for recruiting AI researchers and engineers, nor exact criteria for randomization and blinding, raising concerns about statistical power and bias control. Furthermore, the plan omits mention of technologies or frameworks for measuring energy consumption quantitatively and reliably across diverse hardware and training configurations, which is crucial to validating the impact. Additionally, there is insufficient consideration for participant diversity (e.g., industry vs. academia, different model types and sizes), which affects generalizability and interpretability. Finally, the longer-term adoption studies are vaguely defined without a timeline or success metrics. To strengthen feasibility, the proposal should incorporate comprehensive experimental protocol details, including power analysis, participant recruitment strategies ensuring sample representativeness, validated energy monitoring solutions, and well-defined primary and secondary outcome measures with statistical analysis plans. This will substantially boost confidence that the study outcomes will be robust, reproducible, and informative for iterative platform refinement and eventual broader deployment, aligning with the ambitions stated in the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section."
