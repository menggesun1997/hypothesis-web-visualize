    "title": "Federated Human-Centered AI System Incorporating Nursing Informatics for Bias Reduction",
    "Problem_Statement": "Bias mitigation in healthcare LLMs often lacks practical integration with nursing informatics and human-centered design, limiting real-world scalability and accountability.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to internal gaps in translating human-centered design to scalable applications and external gaps linking nursing informatics with AI, inspired by Opportunity 2.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a federated LLM training platform that integrates nursing practice data with human-centered AI design. Incorporate feedback loops from nursing experts to iteratively refine model fairness and interpretability. Leverage federated learning to preserve privacy while promoting equitable model updates across care settings.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect nursing informatics datasets from multiple healthcare centers.\n2) Develop federated LLM with human-centered modules.\n3) Implement nurse-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms.\n4) Evaluate bias metrics, interpretability, nursing acceptance and usability.\n5) Conduct pilot deployment and monitor longitudinal impact on care equity.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Nursing notes capturing patient care nuances.\nOutput: LLM outputs aiding nurses with fair, interpretable recommendations aligned with care standards.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated framework faces instability, switch to centralized or hybrid models incorporating nurse feedback or simulate feedback via synthetic annotations."

Clarify the mechanism of feedback integration—e.g., model update protocols, interface designs, and evaluation criteria—to demonstrate a solid, reproducible method rather than a conceptual framework. This will strengthen the soundness of the approach and make it clearer how the federated system addresses bias in a human-centered manner effectively and transparently at scale, beyond asserting feedback loops exist."

          "feedback_content": "To enhance novelty and impact in this competitive space, consider integrating differential privacy mechanisms explicitly to balance privacy preservation and bias mitigation, leveraging established privacy-accuracy trade-off frameworks from federated learning literature. Additionally, incorporating reinforcement learning techniques for optimizing nurse-in-the-loop feedback efficacy or diagnostic decision support systems can create a more dynamic, adaptive model. These integrations, drawn from the provided Globally-Linked Concepts, can position the system at the intersection of privacy-preserving AI and adaptive healthcare decision support, increasing both scientific contribution and real-world applicability."
