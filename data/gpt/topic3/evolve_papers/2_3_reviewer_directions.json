    "title": "Synthesis of Ethical Transparency Metrics in Retrieval-Augmented Gen AI Evaluation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of integrated transparency and ethical standards within evaluation frameworks for retrieval-augmented generation leaves models vulnerable to undisclosed biases and originality issues in sensitive content creation.",
    "Motivation": "Bridges a critical gap by embedding transparency and ethical dimensions directly into evaluation metrics, inspired by standards from the health sciences institutional review process, promoting trustworthiness in generative outputs for NLP tasks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce an evaluative protocol combining automated detection of potential ethical risks—such as hallucination, bias, plagiarism—from retrieval sources with transparency scores assessing traceability of generated content to original data. Develop explainable interfaces revealing retrieval provenance and ethical risks alongside accuracy scores.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Annotate datasets with ethical incident labels and provenance links.\n2. Develop metric suites quantifying ethical lapse indicators.\n3. Experiment comparing standard accuracy metrics vs. combined ethical transparency metrics.\n4. Assess improvements in model disclosures and user trustworthiness ratings.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Generation of financial advice augmented by retrieved market reports.\nExpected Output: Report highlighting confidence levels, retrieval source attribution, and flagged ethical concerns such as conflicts of interest or unsupported claims.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If automated ethical signal extraction is noisy, incorporate crowdsourced validation or domain expert adjudication in metric training cycles."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an evaluative protocol combining automated detection of ethical risks with transparency scores and explainable interfaces. However, the mechanism by which these metrics will be quantitatively derived, validated, and integrated remains underspecified. Specifically, it's unclear how the system will effectively detect complex ethical lapses such as bias and plagiarism in varied retrieval-augmented generation scenarios, nor how the transparency scoring will be standardized to ensure consistency and comparability. Clarifying these mechanisms, including algorithmic foundations and explainability techniques, is crucial for assessing soundness and reproducibility of the approach, and should be elaborated before proceeding further, ensuring a robust methodological contribution rather than a high-level concept description. This clarification will also guide experimental design and validation rigorously within ethical AI evaluation frameworks."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the presence of globally-linked concepts around education, a promising way to enhance impact and differentiate this work is to extend the ethical transparency metrics framework explicitly to retrieval-augmented generative applications in educational settings. For example, integrating personalized learning experience or student engagement domains could create tailored ethical evaluation protocols sensitive to issues like educational equity, information accuracy, and support system reliability. Embedding institutional review-inspired ethical metrics into educational tool evaluations can address real concerns about exacerbating inequalities or misinformation in academic performance prediction or student support systems. Explicitly linking your research to these globally recognized challenges within the higher education environment could strengthen impact, make novelty more concrete, and broaden the relevance beyond financial advice to socially critical NLP applications."
