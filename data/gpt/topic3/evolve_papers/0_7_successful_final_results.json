        "title": "Interactive Human-in-the-Loop AI Testing Framework Incorporating Cognitive Psychology and Adaptive Tutoring Paradigms",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM evaluation frameworks insufficiently integrate large-scale cognitive and psychological human testing paradigms and lack dynamic, interactive adaptation to model responses, missing crucial insights into alignment with human reasoning, biases, and acceptance behaviors.",
        "Motivation": "While existing evaluations incorporate cognitive psychology, their novelty remains limited due to static test designs and scalability challenges. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel, interactive human-in-the-loop testing framework that dynamically calibrates assessments through intelligent tutoring system concepts, enabling nuanced, adaptive measurement of human-like cognition, learning traits, and technology acceptance. This approach leverages scalable, longitudinal validation protocols and integration of human-AI collaboration metrics, positioning our framework at the frontier of human-centered AI evaluation beyond classical benchmarks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We will develop a platform combining standardized cognitive and psychological tests with an adaptive, human-in-the-loop evaluation system inspired by intelligent tutoring systems. This system will interactively and dynamically adjust test difficulty and content in response to LLM outputs, simulating real-time learning and reasoning scenarios. Additionally, we incorporate the technology acceptance model to assess human trust, bias perception, and acceptance of LLM-generated content. Using modular data pipelines and human-AI collaboration feedback loops, composite human-centered AI metrics—covering empathy, political neutrality, personality consistency, transparency, and user acceptance—will be constructed. The framework will utilize existing cognitive datasets, crowdsourced mini-experiments, and focused pilot longitudinal studies to ensure scalability, statistical validity, and reproducibility.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate and adapt cognitive and psychological test suites relevant for language understanding, aligned with existing validated datasets.\n2) Design and implement an adaptive testing module based on intelligent tutoring system architectures enabling dynamic task calibration to LLM responses.\n3) Integrate technology acceptance model questionnaires assessing human trust and cognitive bias towards LLM outputs within interactive sessions.\n4) Conduct focused pilot studies with representative human participants and LLM evaluations to validate longitudinal protocols, ensuring statistical power and data quality.\n5) Develop robust data pipelines for integrating cognitive test results, adaptive response data, and acceptance metrics into composite, reproducible human-centered AI scores.\n6) Scale up experiments progressively, leveraging crowdsourcing with quality controls and human-in-the-loop feedback loops to refine test designs.\n7) Analyze resulting data to compare LLMs against human baselines, uncover alignment gaps, and evaluate dynamic behavioral patterns and trust dimensions.\n8) Iterate benchmark refinements based on insights to optimize framework robustness and impact.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "An LLM undergoes an adaptive test session where its theory-of-mind reasoning tasks adjust in real time based on prior answers, interleaved with technology acceptance questionnaires capturing human evaluators’ trust and perceived biases. The framework outputs multi-dimensional scores reflecting not only cognition and ethical alignment but also dynamic human-LLM interaction quality and acceptance—informing more comprehensive model evaluation and alignment strategies.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If scaling large longitudinal studies proves prohibitive, we will prioritize iterative pilot experiments combined with rigorous adaptation of existing cognitive datasets and carefully designed crowdsourced validation tasks incorporating human-in-the-loop quality checks and partial automation. This approach ensures methodical progress towards full-scale deployment without sacrificing statistical validity or reproducibility."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan suggests integrating cognitive and psychological tests with NLP benchmarks and comparing LLMs against human baselines. However, the plan lacks detailed clarification on how to effectively scale cognitive testing for LLMs, given the inherent complexities and resource intensiveness of psychological measurements. The brief fallback to simulated cognitive tests and crowdsourcing might not yield robust or representative human baselines. To be feasible, the plan needs clearer strategies for managing resource demands, ensuring statistical validity, and operationalizing composite scores in a reproducible manner, perhaps by piloting smaller focused studies before large-scale deployment, or leveraging existing cognitive datasets and human-in-the-loop evaluation frameworks rigorously adapted for LLM contexts. Without addressing these feasibility challenges concretely, the experiment plan risks being overly ambitious or impractical in real-world settings, which could stall progress or produce unreliable results. Thus, detailed feasibility considerations and validation protocols should be integrated upfront in the experimental design section to enhance robustness and operational viability of this promising interdisciplinary testing approach. Its current sketch is too high-level and optimistic for immediate implementation without clearer resource and methodological management vistas, which strongly warrants revision before proceeding to implementation stages. This critique primarily targets the Experiment_Plan section but impacts the entire research viability. \n\nSuggested focus: Develop detailed protocols for longitudinal cognitive validation, participant sampling, scaling strategies, and data integration pipelines explicitly stated in the plan for pragmatic feasibility assurance and trustworthy human-centered benchmarking outcomes.  This improvement will markedly strengthen the proposal’s credibility and practical roadmap clarity.  \n\n---\n\n[SUGGESTION] Enhancing the feasibility with concrete pilot studies and resource plans should be prioritized immediately to avert scalability pitfalls and ensure experimental rigor in this pioneering framework proposal.\n\n---\n\n[FEA-EXPERIMENT] is crucial given the resource intensity of psychological testing embedded in LLM evaluation frameworks and composite metric derivation complexities, currently underdeveloped in the submission. Please address this as a priority before further development proceeds.\n\n--\n\nTarget Section: Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "While the proposal compellingly integrates cognitive psychology methods to evaluate LLMs, its novelty was rated merely competitive. To enhance both impact and novelty, I suggest explicitly incorporating concepts from 'human-in-the-loop' and 'intelligent tutoring systems' within the testing framework. For instance, integrating adaptive tutoring system paradigms could enable dynamic interaction between humans and LLMs during evaluations, allowing real-time calibration of tests to individual model responses and more nuanced measurement of human-like learning and reasoning traits. Additionally, leveraging 'technology acceptance model' concepts could help assess how human cognitive biases influence acceptance and trust in LLM outputs, enriching the psychological dimensions of evaluation beyond static tests. These globally linked concepts could transform the framework from a static testing platform to an interactive, context-aware evaluation ecosystem, increasing practical relevance and expanding impact across AI alignment, human-AI collaboration, and educational technology. Embedding these elements would concretely broaden the framework's scope and position it at the frontier of human-centered AI evaluation research. This suggestion mainly targets the Proposed_Method section but has positive ramifications throughout the proposal. Incorporating these perspectives is a high-leverage way to enhance novelty and impact given the already competitive saturation in AI psychological testing research.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
