    "title": "Dynamic Socio-Technical Impact Simulation for Fairness Intervention Assessment",
    "Problem_Statement": "Fairness interventions often lack evaluation against complex socio-technical impact scenarios, such as power shifts and systemic bias amplification influenced by legal frameworks and social norms.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the internal gap of limited socio-technical value considerations and external gap of legal/social constraints interplay, this project proposes simulation-based evaluation toolkits embedding socio-technical dynamics into fairness assessment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a simulation environment modeling agents representing social groups, legal actors, and ML systems interacting across the NLP pipeline. Incorporate rule-based and learned representations of legal constraints, power relations, and social norms. Run counterfactual fairness interventions to observe systemic impacts over time and feedback loops.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Integrate real-world social network data and legal corpora in the simulation. Evaluate NLP tasks affecting decision-making (e.g., job screening). Baselines: interventions without socio-technical simulations. Metrics: emergent fairness dynamics, amplification or attenuation of bias indicators.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Resume screening NLP system with gender and ethnicity attributes. Expected output: Telemetry of fairness impact evolution, revealing if interventions reduce or exacerbate systemic bias over simulated social cycles.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If simulations are inconclusive, focus on analytical modeling of specific socio-technical feedback loops using causal inference methods."
