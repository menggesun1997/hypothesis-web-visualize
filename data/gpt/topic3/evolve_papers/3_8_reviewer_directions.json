    "title": "Legal and Ethical Bias Taxonomy for NLP Data Construction Processes",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is insufficient formalization of legal and ethical constraints intertwined with data construction techniques like counterfactual generation and minority oversampling in NLP fairness research.",
    "Motivation": "This research fills the critical external gap of underexplored relationships between dataset construction and societal/legal harms by building a bias taxonomy explicitly embedding legal and ethical dimensions, guiding responsible data augmentation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Analyze relevant legislation (GDPR, anti-discrimination laws) and ethical principles to extract compliance criteria. Map these criteria onto dataset construction methods, creating a taxonomy that categorizes safe vs. risky augmentation approaches. Develop protocols ensuring augmentation respects legal boundaries and reduces systemic biases.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Apply taxonomy to multiple NLP datasets, review augmentation strategies, conduct impact assessments on bias mitigation vs. legal compliance metrics. Engage legal experts in iterative validation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Minority group data oversampling for sentiment classifier. Expected output: Augmentation plan compliant with privacy and anti-discrimination norms, reducing bias without legal violations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If taxonomy complexity impedes application, develop automated compliance checking tools integrated with data augmentation pipelines."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The proposal correctly identifies the underexplored link between dataset construction techniques and legal/ethical harms; however, the assumption that a comprehensive taxonomy can capture the rapidly evolving and jurisdictionally diverse landscape of legal norms and ethical positions may be overly optimistic. The research should explicitly address how differing legal frameworks (e.g., beyond GDPR and select anti-discrimination laws) and cultural ethical norms will be accommodated or scoped to maintain soundness and relevance. Without clarifying this, the taxonomy risks being simultaneously too narrow or too unwieldy, reducing its practical utility and generalizability in NLP fairness research contexts. Strengthening this assumption will solidify the foundational premise of the work to ensure the output taxonomy is both valid and actionable across targeted legal domains and ethical perspectives by design rather than as an afterthought or a fuzzy approximation. Suggestions include defining clear jurisdictional boundaries or modular taxonomy components adaptable per region or task domain for soundness and future extensibility instead of a single monolithic taxonomy covering all nuances implicitly.\" ,\"target_section\":\"Problem_Statement\"},{"

        {
          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The experimental plan's strength lies in applying the taxonomy across multiple NLP datasets and involving legal experts iteratively. However, it lacks concrete specification regarding how bias mitigation will be quantitatively measured alongside legal compliance, which may impact feasibility. For example, it is unclear what metrics will be used to assess compliance with privacy or anti-discrimination laws in the context of data augmentation, or how conflicting trade-offs (legal vs. fairness) will be empirically evaluated. Furthermore, engaging legal experts is critical, but the proposal does not elaborate on their role, frequency of interaction, or validation protocols, which risks vague operationalization and reproducibility. To improve feasibility, the methodology should define concrete measurable criteria, e.g., legal compliance checklists mapped to augmentation methods, detailed experimental controls to isolate effects, and structured legal expert review stages with clear decision rules. This will ensure that the experimental validation is robust, scientifically rigorous, and practical to execute within typical research resource and timeline constraints.\" ,\"target_section\":\"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\"},{"

        {
          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE owing to strong prior art linking legal constraints and bias in NLP, the work could elevate impact and originality by integrating concepts such as machine unlearning or pre-trained language models to dynamically enforce the legal-ethical taxonomy during data augmentation or model fine-tuning. For example, incorporating automated compliance checking directly into augmentation pipelines with adaptive unlearning methods could offer a technically novel mechanism that operationalizes the taxonomy beyond static guidelines. Additionally, aligning the taxonomy framework with US law or civil rights laws would broaden geographic applicability and appeal to a wider audience. Exploring these globally linked concepts would position the contribution at the intersection of legal, ethical, and technical frontiers in NLP fairness, thus strengthening its competitive edge and real-world adoption potential."
