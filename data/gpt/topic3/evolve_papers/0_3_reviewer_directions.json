    "title": "Neurocognitive-Inspired Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning Evaluation",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs exhibit unstable reasoning performance; small perturbations cause misleading evaluation results, reflecting a lack of neurocognitive-inspired testing frameworks linking reasoning and decision-making fidelity.",
    "Motivation": "Bridges internal gaps of inconsistent reliability with high-potential opportunity by embedding reinforcement learning signatures reflecting neurocognitive processes into LLM evaluation for more robust reasoning assessment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an evaluation protocol where LLMs perform sequential reasoning tasks with embedded decision points modeled by reinforcement learning reward structures mimicking human neurocognitive processes. Measure learning curves and error patterns reflective of cognitive fatigue or bias, offering nuanced performance reliability metrics beyond static benchmarks.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Design sequential reasoning NLP tasks (e.g., multi-hop QA); 2) Implement reinforcement learning-inspired reward functions based on accuracy and reasoning trace quality; 3) Evaluate GPT-family models and fine-tune with RL; 4) Analyze performance stability under input perturbations; 5) Compare with human neurocognitive data from psychological experiments.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multi-hop question: 'Who was president when the inventor of X was born?' Model proceeds through reasoning steps with reward feedback, outputting intermediate justifications. Evaluation captures both final answer accuracy and reasoning path quality.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If RL-inspired metrics prove too noisy, fallback to static psychometric-inspired scores reflecting reasoning consistency and confidence calibration metrics."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method currently suggests embedding reinforcement learning (RL) reward structures mimicking human neurocognitive processes, but lacks clarity and specificity on how exactly these neurocognitive signals or reward signatures will be modeled and integrated into LLM evaluation. The mechanism relating cognitive fatigue or bias to measurable RL reward feedback is not concretely defined, making it difficult to assess the soundness of the approach or to replicate it. You should clarify the computational mapping of neurocognitive markers to RL reward shaping, intermediate reasoning trace evaluation, and how these relate to existing RL techniques applied to LLMs, to strengthen the mechanistic foundation and make the contribution clear and credible for the community.\"}, {"
