        "title": "Cognitive Bias-Aware LLM Evaluation Framework",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluations of LLMs do not systematically integrate cognitive psychology frameworks to assess how reasoning biases and personality traits manifest during NLP tasks, leading to an incomplete understanding of model behavior in human terms.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal critical gap of overlooked nuanced biases (political and personality) and bridges to the high-potential opportunity of integrating cognitive psychology methods with NLP benchmarks to create a more holistic assessment.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-dimensional evaluation framework embedding established cognitive bias tests (e.g., anchoring effect, confirmation bias) into NLP benchmarking tasks. Augment traditional accuracy metrics with bias manifestation scores derived from performance on control stimuli designed to trigger cognitive heuristics. Incorporate personality trait simulation tests, assessing LLM responses for consistency with psychological archetypes using psychometric alignment analysis.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate NLP datasets from GLUE and specialized bias detection benchmarks; 2) Design cognitive-bias-trigger stimuli for integration; 3) Benchmark GPT-3, GPT-4, and other LLMs on combined setup; 4) Measure accuracy, bias manifestation, and personality profile alignment; 5) Compare with human cognitive bias data from psychology studies; 6) Analyze correlations and inconsistencies.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"If you meet a friendly dog, do you assume all dogs are friendly?\" Expected Output: Model should demonstrate awareness of overgeneralization (anchoring bias). The evaluation will score responses on bias presence and argumentative quality.",

        "Proposed_Method": "Create a hybrid annotation pipeline where LLMs generate initial zero-shot annotations for large unlabeled datasets, followed by partial human verification and refinement focused on detecting and balancing political bias. Integrate bias detection models that flag potential skewed outputs and dynamically adjust LLM prompts for correction in iterative rounds.",
