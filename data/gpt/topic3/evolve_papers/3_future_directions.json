        "title": "Cross-Domain Pipeline Fairness Framework for Clinical NLP",
        "Problem_Statement": "Clinical NLP applications are increasingly influencing healthcare decisions, yet current fairness frameworks tailored for general NLP do not capture the unique lifecycle complexities in clinical pipelines, risking biased outcomes that could lead to health disparities.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical gap of integrating pipeline-based fairness approaches from ML lifecycle into healthcare decision support systems, directly responding to the underexplored intersection of LLM fairness research with health sciences pipelines.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a modular, domain-sensitive pipeline fairness framework that combines existing ML fairness taxonomies with clinical decision support pipeline stages (data acquisition, preprocessing, inference, action). The framework will include domain-adapted bias detection metrics and mitigation strategies aligned with clinical risk priorities, embedding clinical expert feedback loops and compliance constraints into fairness interventions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Use publicly available clinical NLP datasets, e.g., MIMIC-III notes, extend existing LLMs fine-tuned for clinical tasks (named entity recognition, phenotyping). Baselines: standard fairness pipelines without clinical domain adaptation. Metrics: fairness (equal opportunity, demographic parity), clinical outcome impact, calibration. Experiment with bias detection at each pipeline stage, apply mitigation strategies, compare patient subgroup performance.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical note mentioning female patient with symptoms. Expected output: Accurate symptom extraction with minimized gender bias. Evaluate if the pipeline avoids systematic misrepresentation affecting downstream risk scores.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If domain adaptation yields marginal improvements, pivot to a hybrid human-in-the-loop system for identifying clinical fairness blind spots or focus on simulating synthetic clinical biases for stress testing pipeline robustness."

        "title": "Embedding Value-Sensitive Design in LLM Bias Mitigation Taxonomies",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing bias mitigation taxonomies largely gloss over socio-technical values, power asymmetries, and ethical reflections within mitigation methods, limiting meaningful ethical integration in model fairness.",
        "Motivation": "This project targets the internal gap of limited emphasis on socio-technical values within ML fairness research by embedding value-sensitive design principles explicitly into bias mitigation taxonomies and processes, introducing ethical dimensions as core criteria.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct an enriched mitigation taxonomy incorporating value-sensitive design stages: stakeholder identification, value elicitation, ethical reflection checkpoints, power dynamics mapping. Develop operational protocols for integrating these into pre-, in-, intra-, post-processing bias interventions. Implement support tools that guide practitioners to assess systemic implications alongside traditional fairness metrics.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Select benchmark NLP tasks prone to social biases: sentiment analysis, toxicity detection. Compare standard mitigation pipelines vs. value-sensitive enhanced pipelines using augmented taxonomies. Measure fairness improvements, ethical audit scores via qualitative content analysis and downstream societal impact proxies from controlled simulations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Social media text with gendered language. Expected output: Model predictions balanced for gender groups with documented consideration of underlying power structures in mitigation report.",

        "title": "Bio-Inspired Counterfactual Dataset Augmentation for Fair NLP",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current synthetic data augmentation for minority classes (e.g., SMOTE) inadequately reflect real-world complexity and may amplify biases rather than mitigate them, especially in socially sensitive NLP datasets.",

        "Proposed_Method": "Design a pipeline integrating biological measures of data lineage, sequence authenticity, and taxonomic diversity to NLP dataset augmentation. Generate counterfactual linguistic samples reflecting authentic minority subgroup language variations. Employ adaptive augmentation filters modeled after sequencing QC thresholds, ensuring synthetic samples reduce bias and preserve legal/social constraints.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Apply the method to social bias benchmark datasets (e.g., Bias in Bios, Jigsaw). Augment minority dialect or demographic subgroup data. Baselines include vanilla SMOTE and GAN-based augmentations. Evaluate fairness metrics, linguistic authenticity (via perplexity, human evaluation), and model downstream task performance.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Minority dialect sentence \"He go store yesterday.\" Expected output: Realistic counterfactual augmentations preserving dialect traits without bias amplification, improving classification fairness for that subgroup.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "In case biological analogies do not translate, fallback to hybrid data augmentation combining expert-curated linguistic rules and statistical resampling methods."

        "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of comprehensive auditing frameworks that merge principles from ML pipeline fairness and biological sequencing pipelines to systematically uncover bias propagation paths in LLMs applied to diverse NLP domains.",
        "Motivation": "This idea synthesizes the cross-disciplinary gap integrating lifecycle and pipeline assessment methods from microbiology with ML fairness pipelines to build an innovative auditing tool revealing latent bias sources at multiple abstraction layers.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an auditing framework that treats NLP model components analogously to microbial sequencing steps: data sourcing (sample prep), feature extraction (sequencing), model training (assembly), inference (annotation). Employ iterative contamination detection, quality filtering, and lineage tracing concepts adapted to fairness assessment to visualize bias flow and accumulation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Test on datasets with known biases in demographic attributes and semantic content. Apply framework to state-of-the-art LLM NLP pipelines. Metrics: bias accumulation indices, contamination detection accuracy. Compare to traditional bias detection methods.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sensitive demographic dataset with embedded biases. Expected output: Visualized bias contamination points at dataset, embedding, and inference stages with mitigation recommendations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct biological analogy is weak, pivot towards developing multi-perspective bias tracing using graph-based lineage models common in both disciplines."

Incorporate rule-based and learned representations of legal constraints, power relations, and social norms. Run counterfactual fairness interventions to observe systemic impacts over time and feedback loops.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Integrate real-world social network data and legal corpora in the simulation. Evaluate NLP tasks affecting decision-making (e.g., job screening). Baselines: interventions without socio-technical simulations. Metrics: emergent fairness dynamics, amplification or attenuation of bias indicators.",
