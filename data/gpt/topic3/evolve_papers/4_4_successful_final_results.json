        "title": "Uncertainty-Guided Imbalance-Aware Prompt Catalogs for Multimodal Few-Shot Software NLP Tasks",
        "Problem_Statement": "Few-shot and severely imbalanced data scenarios in software engineering natural language processing tasks challenge the reliability and efficiency of large language models (LLMs). Existing methods struggle to adapt model prompting effectively under constrained computational budgets, especially without mechanisms that dynamically account for data imbalance and uncertainty, limiting robust exploitation of multimodal software artifacts such as textual vulnerability reports and code snippets.",
        "Motivation": "This work addresses the competitive novelty gap in imbalance-aware prompting by innovatively integrating uncertainty estimation and multimodal learning into prompt catalog design for software NLP applications. By explicitly combining imbalance-sensitive prompt augmentation with uncertainty-driven prompt weighting and leveraging both textual and code modalities, we aim to achieve superior robustness, adaptability, and efficiency in few-shot LLM use for software vulnerability detection and code analysis. This approach surpasses classical prompt engineering by introducing a principled control mechanism grounded in mathematically formalized feedback and uncertainty modules, thus elevating the impact and generalization of imbalance-aware prompting strategies.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel framework that: \n1) Constructs an imbalance-aware prompt catalog extended via Synthetic Minority Oversampling of prompts (SMOP), where minority class prompts are algorithmically generated by semantically perturbing existing prompts to synthetically expand rare classes in the prompt space. Formally, given a prompt set P with class distribution D, SMOP synthesizes new prompts \\( P'_{min} \\) using controlled semantic transformations \\( T_s \\) applied to minority class prompts, ensuring semantic consistency. \n\n2) Integrates a dynamic repetition weighting scheme that formally modulates prompt sampling probabilities \\( p_i \\) proportional to both class inverse frequency and uncertainty scores \\( u_i \\), utilizing Bayesian uncertainty estimation from LLM outputs. The sampling probability for prompt i is defined as:\n\\[ p_i = \\frac{(1 / f_{class_i}) \\cdot u_i^\\alpha}{\\sum_j (1 / f_{class_j}) \\cdot u_j^\\alpha} \\]\nwhere \\( f_{class_i} \\) is class frequency and \\( \\alpha \\) controls uncertainty influence.\n\n3) Embeds a feedback control loop that continuously monitors class distribution and uncertainty metrics from prediction outputs to update \\( p_i \\) iteratively in few-shot inference. The control algorithm conducts steps:\n- Compute current class distribution \\( D_t \\) and uncertainty \\( U_t \\) over recent outputs.\n- Adjust prompt sampling distribution \\( P_t \\) via a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller targeting uniform class representation and minimizing uncertainty.\n\n4) Leverages multimodal inputs by jointly encoding textual vulnerability reports and associated source code snippets using pretrained language models and code encoders, concatenating their embedded features into prompts to enrich context and improve discriminative power.\n\n5) The entire mechanism is formally described in Algorithm 1 (pseudo-code) and visualized via a flowchart, detailing data flow from input multimodal samples through augmentation, uncertainty estimation, dynamic sampling, and feedback control to final prediction, all optimized under compute constraints.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select benchmark software engineering datasets exhibiting severe label imbalance, containing both textual vulnerability reports and code snippets (e.g., VulDeePecker variant datasets). 2) Establish baseline few-shot prompting techniques without augmentation or uncertainty weighting. 3) Implement the SMOP method for imbalance-aware prompt expansion and the dynamic uncertainty-weighted repetition sampling with formal PI feedback controller. 4) Integrate multimodal encodings of text plus code into prompt catalog entries. 5) Evaluate performance with precision, recall, F1-score, and computational resource measurements (inference time, memory) across varying imbalance ratios and few-shot settings. 6) Conduct ablation studies quantifying the contribution of each component (SMOP, uncertainty weighting, feedback control, multimodal fusion). 7) Benchmark against state-of-the-art imbalance-aware and uncertainty-aware few-shot prompting methods. 8) Analyze results for robustness, efficiency, and scalability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A rare security vulnerability report with an associated source code snippet reporting a novel buffer overflow vulnerability (minority class).\nExpected output: Correct classification of the vulnerability despite limited prior examples, achieved with fewer prompt tokens and dynamically adjusted prompt selection favoring minority class and uncertain cases, demonstrating model robustness and computational efficiency.\nAdditional tests include multimodal inputs with ambiguous textual descriptions resolved by code context, showcasing the advantage of the multimodal prompt catalog.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the uncertainty-guided, multimodal imbalance-aware prompting underperforms, fallback strategies include:\n- Employing ensemble prompting with independently trained class-specialized prompts for minority classes.\n- Integrating external imbalance-aware classifiers via post-processing to improve minority class recall.\n- Simplifying the feedback control loop to heuristic threshold-based prompt resampling.\nThese alternatives ensure baseline robustness while retaining parts of the imbalance-aware augmentation pipeline."

For instance, the mechanism of synthetic minority oversampling prompts and dynamic repetition weighting needs clearer formalization, including mathematical or algorithmic details. Additionally, how the feedback control system quantitatively monitors class distributions and influences prompt probabilities should be explicitly described to ensure reproducibility and soundness of the approach. Clarifying these mechanisms will improve understanding and strengthen the work's credibility and implementation feasibility, especially under constrained computational budgets targeted by the problem statement.

For example, incorporating uncertainty estimation to dynamically prioritize or weight prompts could further increase robustness in few-shot scenarios with imbalanced classes. Alternatively, extending the approach to leverage multimodal inputs such as source code snippets alongside textual vulnerability reports may enrich prompt catalog effectiveness and generalization. Exploring these integrations may elevate the contribution beyond typical imbalanced learning and prompt engineering combinations, potentially addressing broader challenges in software vulnerability detection or code analysis. This alignment with state-of-the-art areas would heighten the novelty and impact of the research, making it more competitive for premier venues."
