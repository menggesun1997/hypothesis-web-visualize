    "title": "Self-Supervised Domain Adaptation via Contrastive Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning",
    "Problem_Statement": "Domain-specific LLMs often produce hallucinated or inconsistent outputs, especially under limited annotated data and domain shifts. Existing adaptation methods marginally improve fluency but lack robustness and factual consistency in specialized settings.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the internal critical gap of LLM brittleness and hallucination in domain-specific adaptation, leveraging high-potential innovation opportunity 1 on self-supervised and continual learning to reduce annotation reliance and enhance robustness through hierarchical task decomposition.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a self-supervised hierarchical reinforcement learning framework where the LLM is decomposed into modular sub-policy networks responsible for content planning, factual verification, and language generation. Using contrastive learning objectives, the model learns to distinguish domain-relevant from irrelevant content without labeled data. Reinforcement rewards encourage factual consistency and penalize hallucinations by integrating an internal NLI-based fact checker as a learned critic. The hierarchy enables explicit planning and grounding at multiple discourse levels, enhancing interpretability and robustness to domain shifts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement the hierarchical RL architecture atop a pretrained LLM (e.g., GPT). 2) Use self-supervised contrastive tasks on unannotated biomedical and clinical corpora for domain adaptation. 3) Benchmark against vanilla fine-tuning and modular planning baselines on domain-specific summarization tasks (e.g., clinical note summarization). 4) Evaluate factual consistency via SummaC and domain-adapted NLI metrics plus newly developed domain robustness scores. 5) Perform ablations isolating contrastive learning and hierarchy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A clinical discharge summary draft. Output: A coherent, factually consistent summary that accurately reflects patient's condition and treatment plan without hallucinated or contradicting information, verified against the input with a fact-check score above threshold.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If hierarchical RL proves unstable, fallback to a two-stage approach with self-supervised contrastive domain adaptation followed by reinforcement fine-tuning using external fact-checking modules. Alternatively, explore curriculum learning with incremental complexity in domain tasks."
