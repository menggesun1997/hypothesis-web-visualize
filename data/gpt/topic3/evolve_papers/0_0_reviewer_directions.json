    "title": "Cognitive Bias-Aware LLM Evaluation Framework",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluations of LLMs do not systematically integrate cognitive psychology frameworks to assess how reasoning biases and personality traits manifest during NLP tasks, leading to an incomplete understanding of model behavior in human terms.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal critical gap of overlooked nuanced biases (political and personality) and bridges to the high-potential opportunity of integrating cognitive psychology methods with NLP benchmarks to create a more holistic assessment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-dimensional evaluation framework embedding established cognitive bias tests (e.g., anchoring effect, confirmation bias) into NLP benchmarking tasks. Augment traditional accuracy metrics with bias manifestation scores derived from performance on control stimuli designed to trigger cognitive heuristics. Incorporate personality trait simulation tests, assessing LLM responses for consistency with psychological archetypes using psychometric alignment analysis.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate NLP datasets from GLUE and specialized bias detection benchmarks; 2) Design cognitive-bias-trigger stimuli for integration; 3) Benchmark GPT-3, GPT-4, and other LLMs on combined setup; 4) Measure accuracy, bias manifestation, and personality profile alignment; 5) Compare with human cognitive bias data from psychology studies; 6) Analyze correlations and inconsistencies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"If you meet a friendly dog, do you assume all dogs are friendly?\" Expected Output: Model should demonstrate awareness of overgeneralization (anchoring bias). The evaluation will score responses on bias presence and argumentative quality.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cognitive bias tests do not yield meaningful differentiation, fallback to a narrower scope focusing on measurable political bias embedding behaviors combined with expanded NLP task accuracy metrics."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an ambitious framework embedding cognitive bias tests and personality trait simulations, but it lacks specificity on how these tests will be quantitatively integrated with existing NLP evaluation metrics. For example, how will bias manifestation scores be normalized relative to accuracy, and what statistical models or validation methods will be employed to ensure rigor in psychometric alignment analysis? Clarifying these mechanisms is essential for assessing whether the method can reliably capture nuanced cognitive biases without conflating them with model noise or dataset artifacts. Strengthening the explanation here will greatly improve the soundness and reproducibility of the approach, aiding others who might build upon this work in the competitive evaluation landscape you acknowledge. Consider detailing the scoring schema, validation procedure for bias detection stimuli, and methods for personality archetype classification in the Proposal_Method section to enhance clarity and trust in the framework’s operation."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and the project's intersection with both NLP and cognitive psychology, a concrete pathway to boost impact and differentiation is to explicitly integrate psychometric inventories and temporal stability analyses from psychology research. For example, incorporating well-established psychometric instruments (e.g., Big Five personality measures) as a comparative baseline or as part of input-output alignment could deepen the interpretability and cross-disciplinary appeal. Moreover, evaluating the temporal stability of bias manifestations across different model versions or fine-tuning stages could reveal insights relevant to the development of artificial general intelligence and human-computer interaction. This integration would bridge the cognitive assessment with broader educational transformation and cultural alignment goals, amplifying societal relevance and attracting attention from both AI and psychology communities. Mapping the framework to these globally linked concepts in your narrative and experimental design could elevate the work’s stature and novelty."
