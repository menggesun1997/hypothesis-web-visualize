    "title": "Self-Perception and Metacognition Evaluation in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs' self-perception and self-assessment capabilities are largely unexplored, yet critical for trustworthy AI interaction and reliability assessment.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses overlooked dimensions within the social and cognitive evaluation aspect highlighted in the research map, opening avenues for testing LLM metacognitive abilities in benchmark tasks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop evaluation tasks where LLMs must reflect on and critique their own output under various NLP challenges, scoring metacognitive awareness, error recognition, and confidence calibration. Incorporate iterative self-correction cycles to measure learning and reliability improvement.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Design NLP tasks with known challenges; 2) Request initial LLM responses plus confidence estimates; 3) Prompt model to evaluate its own output and suggest corrections; 4) Score confidence calibration, correction rates, and error reduction; 5) Benchmark across diverse LLMs; 6) Compare to human meta-cognitive benchmarks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Explain the causes of the French Revolution.' Output: Initial essay with confidence score, followed by a self-review identifying potential misinformation or gaps, and a corrected summary.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If LLMs show poor self-assessment, explore prompting strategies that scaffold metacognitive reasoning or integrate human-in-the-loop feedback."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experimental plan, while conceptually sound, lacks detail regarding the specific evaluation metrics and how calibration and self-correction will be quantitatively measured across different LLM architectures. To improve feasibility, the authors should concretely define standardized metrics for metacognitive awareness, confidence calibration, and error correction rates. Additionally, consideration of dataset selection for the NLP tasks and how to control for variability across models would strengthen experimental reproducibility and scalability. Clarifying these aspects will ensure the experiments can be performed consistently and yield interpretable, comparative results across models and benchmarks, increasing practical feasibility of the approach without unrealistic reliance on perfect self-critique capabilities at the outset of study phases. This refinement is essential before moving into implementation phases to avoid ambiguous outcomes or inconclusive evaluations due to insufficient experimental design clarity or operationalization of key constructs in metacognition evaluation for LLMs. (Target Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)  \n\n---"

          "feedback_content": "Given the 'NOV-COMPETITIVE' novelty rating and the wide range of related globally-linked concepts, the idea would greatly benefit by integrating insights from \"self-regulated learning\" and \"higher-order thinking\" in educational psychology. Specifically, adapting well-established cognitive scaffolding techniques from human learning research to design prompting strategies could potentiate robust metacognitive reasoning in LLMs. Further, connecting the evaluation framework with \"educational data mining\" methods may enable richer analysis of LLM self-assessment behavior and iterative correction processes. Incorporating multi-agent reinforcement learning paradigms could be another promising avenue, allowing LLMs to collaboratively self-correct or critique outputs in peer-model settings to enhance reliability. Such interdisciplinary and multi-paradigm integration will not only broaden the impact of the work beyond NLP into cognitive and educational domains but also position it more competitively by leveraging mature, complementary theories and methods to advance AI metacognition understanding.
