    "title": "Embedding Value-Sensitive Design in LLM Bias Mitigation Taxonomies",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing bias mitigation taxonomies largely gloss over socio-technical values, power asymmetries, and ethical reflections within mitigation methods, limiting meaningful ethical integration in model fairness.",
    "Motivation": "This project targets the internal gap of limited emphasis on socio-technical values within ML fairness research by embedding value-sensitive design principles explicitly into bias mitigation taxonomies and processes, introducing ethical dimensions as core criteria.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct an enriched mitigation taxonomy incorporating value-sensitive design stages: stakeholder identification, value elicitation, ethical reflection checkpoints, power dynamics mapping. Develop operational protocols for integrating these into pre-, in-, intra-, post-processing bias interventions. Implement support tools that guide practitioners to assess systemic implications alongside traditional fairness metrics.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Select benchmark NLP tasks prone to social biases: sentiment analysis, toxicity detection. Compare standard mitigation pipelines vs. value-sensitive enhanced pipelines using augmented taxonomies. Measure fairness improvements, ethical audit scores via qualitative content analysis and downstream societal impact proxies from controlled simulations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Social media text with gendered language. Expected output: Model predictions balanced for gender groups with documented consideration of underlying power structures in mitigation report.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If formal methods fail to scale, develop semi-automated value elicitation tools leveraging crowdsourcing and expert panels to complement automated taxonomy deployment."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks sufficient detail to ensure scientific rigor and practical feasibility. For instance, the metrics and methodologies for measuring 'ethical audit scores' and 'downstream societal impact proxies' are not clearly defined, which risks ambiguity in evaluation outcomes. To strengthen feasibility, please specify concrete quantitative and qualitative measures, data collection protocols, and how controlled simulations will reliably model societal impacts. Clarifying these elements will help demonstrate that the evaluation can effectively validate the added value of value-sensitive design in bias mitigation taxonomies within tangible NLP tasks like sentiment analysis or toxicity detection, thus ensuring the experiment's success and reproducibility.\nAdditionally, the plan should consider potential challenges in operationalizing ethical reflection checkpoints and power dynamics mapping in automated or semi-automated settings, providing contingencies or pilot studies to assess these integrations before full-scale comparisons are conducted. This will enhance the project's risk management and feasibility outlook within the experimental framework since embedding socio-technical values often involves complex interdisciplinary expertise and subjective judgments that may not scale easily through standard ML pipelines or datasets alone.  \n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the project's ethical and socio-technical focus, integration with the globally-linked concept of 'Responsible Artificial Intelligence' is a highly promising avenue to enhance impact and distinctiveness. Specifically, the proposal could incorporate formal legal and societal frameworks such as 'civil rights laws' and relevant 'US law' to ground value-sensitive design principles in enforceable ethical standards, enhancing the rigor and applicability of the developed mitigation taxonomy. \n\nFurthermore, linking the taxonomy and operational protocols with participatory methodologies involving 'human experts' and stakeholders from domains like 'structural inequalities' and 'ethical foundations' can increase transparency and trustworthiness. Embedding federated data governance approaches or engaging with 'federated learning' communities could also extend technical feasibility and broaden socio-technical integration. These steps would not only advance novelty beyond incremental combinations but also markedly lift the work's interdisciplinary resonance and practical relevance in AI fairness research and deployment contexts.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
