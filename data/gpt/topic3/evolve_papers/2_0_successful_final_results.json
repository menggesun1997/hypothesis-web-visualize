    "title": "Multidimensional Evaluation Framework Integrating Health and Education Metrics for Retrieval-Augmented LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluation frameworks for retrieval-augmented generation outputs lack multidimensional rigor, particularly missing domain-aware quality and ethical transparency measures inspired by health sciences and education assessment standards. This limits reliable assessment of accuracy, fairness, and trustworthiness of generated outputs in sensitive domains.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap in rigorous testing frameworks by integrating institutional review and academic competence measures from health sciences and education. This cross-disciplinary synthesis introduces novel evaluation dimensions beyond conventional NLP accuracy.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a composite evaluation framework combining traditional NLP metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, factuality) with domain-specific standards inspired by health (clinical trial safety, protocol adherence) and education (student assessment rubrics, critical thinking indicators). The framework uses modular scoring components and ethical transparency checklists, supported by an explainable dashboard for retrieval-augmented LLM outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate datasets from healthcare-related and educational NLP tasks supplemented with retrieval-augmented outputs.\n2. Implement baseline evaluation using current standard NLP metrics.\n3. Develop and integrate health and education-inspired evaluation modules.\n4. Conduct comparative analyses measuring improvements in evaluation expressiveness, consistency, and ethical detection.\n5. Validate user trust and interpretability with domain expert feedback.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A retrieval-augmented LLM generates clinical trial eligibility criteria from patient data.\nExpected Output: Evaluation report quantifying factual accuracy, adherence to trial protocols, and transparency metrics indicating risk of biased or opaque generation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If modular evaluation components show low correlation with domain expert judgment, pivot to iterative refinement involving more expert-in-the-loop feedback or explore automated evaluation proxies based on proxy annotations."

        "title": "Multidimensional, Security-Integrated Evaluation Framework for Retrieval-Augmented LLMs in Health and Education Domains",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluation methodologies for retrieval-augmented language models inadequately capture multidimensional rigor, especially lacking integration of domain-specific ethical, security, and compliance standards from health informatics and educational assessment. Existing frameworks often miss crucial facets such as data access control adherence and privacy in electronic health records (EHR) and overlook systematic, scalable validation protocols. This gap constrains the reliable assessment of accuracy, fairness, trustworthiness, and regulatory compliance of generated outputs in sensitive domains, thereby limiting the safe deployment of generative AI in healthcare and education.",
        "Motivation": "Despite numerous attempts to integrate domain-aware quality metrics into LLM evaluation, the competitive landscape reveals insufficient incorporation of security and privacy standards foundational in health informatics, such as attribute-based access control (ABAC) and EHR security. Leveraging these concepts alongside robust educational assessment frameworks can significantly enhance evaluation fidelity. Our approach distinguishes itself by uniting ethical transparency with security compliance and validated, scalable expert feedback mechanisms, thus addressing both novelty and practical challenges to trustworthiness and real-world adoption in retrieval-augmented LLMs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel composite evaluation framework that synergistically integrates standard NLP metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, factuality) with multidimensional modules inspired by health informatics and education standards. Key innovations include: (1) Incorporation of security-evaluative submodules assessing compliance with ABAC policies and confidentiality constraints in generated outputs referencing electronic health records; (2) Adoption of ethical transparency checklists enriched with trustworthiness indicators grounded in clinical and educational protocol adherence; (3) Development of an explainable, interactive dashboard that visualizes modular scores alongside security and ethical compliance assessments; (4) Embedding evaluation metrics aligned with intelligent decision-making frameworks used in clinical and educational contexts to broaden impact. This approach ensures not only quality but also confidentiality, access control, and domain-specific ethical rigor in retrieval-augmented generation outputs.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset Curation: Select and construct diverse, representative retrieval-augmented generation datasets from healthcare (e.g., clinical trial eligibility, EHR-based question-answering) and education (e.g., student assessment reports, counseling service transcripts), emphasizing varying security and privacy sensitivity levels. Curate annotations capturing domain-specific correctness, compliance, and ethical dimensions with detailed annotation guidelines.\n\n2. Baseline Evaluation: Apply current NLP metrics to all datasets to establish benchmarking performance.\n\n3. Modular Framework Development: Implement novel evaluation modules integrating health informatics security checks (e.g., ABAC policy violation detection), education assessment rubrics, and ethical transparency metrics.\n\n4. Expert Validation: Recruit multidisciplinary domain experts and systematically collect quantitative validation data through structured annotation tasks. Employ inter-rater reliability metrics (e.g., Cohen's kappa, Fleiss' kappa) and statistical significance tests to assess agreement and correlation with modular scores.\n\n5. Scalability and Reproducibility Assessment: Document resource estimates and time investment required for expert involvement, and develop automated proxy evaluations where feasible to aid scalability.\n\n6. Comparative Analyses: Evaluate the expressive power, consistency, ethical detection capability, and security compliance sensitivity of the new framework against baseline metrics.\n\n7. User Study: Conduct interpretability and trustworthiness assessments via feedback from domain experts using the explainable dashboard.\n\n8. Iteration: Refine modules based on expert and user study feedback to maximize robustness and practical adoption potential.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A retrieval-augmented LLM synthesizes clinical trial eligibility criteria from a patient electronic health record while respecting access control policies.\nExpected Output: Comprehensive evaluation report including: (i) factual accuracy and protocol adherence scores; (ii) detection of any violations of attribute-based access control or privacy constraints within the generated text; (iii) ethical transparency indicators reflecting risk of biased or opaque generation; (iv) user-friendly dashboard visualizing cross-dimensional scores.\n\nInput: An LLM generates feedback for English writing instruction in educational counseling scenarios.\nExpected Output: Evaluation outcomes that quantify alignment with pedagogical rubrics, critical thinking promotion, alongside assessment of data confidentiality and ethical transparency in the generated feedback.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should the modular evaluation components demonstrate low concordance with domain expert judgments, pivot to an iterative refinement process incorporating enhanced expert-in-the-loop annotation cycles and richer domain guidelines. Explore semi-automated proxy annotation strategies using explainable AI methods to reduce expert burden while preserving evaluation quality. Additionally, investigate leveraging machine learning models trained on expert-annotated subsets to generalize proxy evaluations, thereby improving scalability and reproducibility."

          "feedback_content": "While the step-by-step plan to integrate health and education domain standards into an evaluation framework is well structured, it currently lacks detail about how to operationalize and validate the new modular evaluation components in a scalable, reproducible manner. Specifically, the plan should elaborate how datasets will be curated to reflect diverse, representative retrieval-augmented generation scenarios within both domains, and how exactly domain expert feedback will be systematically collected and quantified to ensure robust validation beyond anecdotal assessment. Addressing these points will strengthen confidence in feasibility and reproducibility of the approach at scale, which is essential given the complexity of multidimensional and ethically sensitive evaluation metrics involved.\n\nRecommendation: Define clear criteria for dataset selection and annotation process, specify quantitative measures for expert validation (e.g., inter-rater agreement, statistical tests), and outline resource estimates for expert involvement to better signal practicability and scientific rigor in the experimental plan. This will fortify the experiment's design against feasibility pitfalls and improve clarity for reproducibility and future adoption prospects within the research community.\n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

By embedding security and privacy standards from health informatics into the evaluation framework, the research can address trustworthiness and compliance rigorously, which is a critical and underexplored dimension in retrieval-augmented LLM evaluation.\n\nConcretely, extending the framework to evaluate whether generated outputs respect data access restrictions and confidentiality constraints could differentiate this work. Connecting evaluation metrics to intelligent decision-making systems used in clinical and educational contexts could further broaden impact, appealing to interdisciplinary audiences. Including these aspects would reinforce the ethical transparency measures and align with real-world deployment challenges faced by AI in sensitive domains.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
