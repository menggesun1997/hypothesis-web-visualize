As LLMs continue to play a vital role in both research and daily use, their evaluation becomes increasingly critical, not only at the task level, but also at the society level for better understanding of their potential risks. Over the past years, significant efforts have been made to examine LLMs from various perspectives. This paper presents a comprehensive review of these evaluation methods for LLMs, focusing on three key dimensions: what to evaluate , where to evaluate , and how to evaluate . Firstly, we provide an overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general natural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics, education, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas. Secondly, we answer the ‘where’ and ‘how’ questions by diving into the evaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in assessing the performance of LLMs. Then, we summarize the success and failure cases of LLMs in different tasks. Finally, we shed light on several future challenges that lie ahead in LLMs evaluation. Our aim is to offer invaluable insights to researchers in the realm of LLMs evaluation, thereby aiding the development of more proficient LLMs. Our key point is that evaluation should be treated as an essential discipline to better assist the development of LLMs. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at: https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/LLM-eval-survey '}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Can Large Language Models Transform Computational Social Science?', 'abstract': 'Abstract Large language models (LLMs) are capable of successfully performing many language processing tasks zero-shot (without training data). If zero-shot LLMs can also reliably classify and explain social phenomena like persuasiveness and political ideology, then LLMs could augment the computational social science (CSS) pipeline in important ways. This work provides a road map for using LLMs as CSS tools. Towards this end, we contribute a set of prompting best practices and an extensive evaluation pipeline to measure the zero-shot performance of 13 language models on 25 representative English CSS benchmarks. On taxonomic labeling tasks (classification), LLMs fail to outperform the best fine-tuned models but still achieve fair levels of agreement with humans. On free-form coding tasks (generation), LLMs produce explanations that often exceed the quality of crowdworkers’ gold references. We conclude that the performance of today’s LLMs can augment the CSS research pipeline in two ways: (1) serving as zero-shot data annotators on human annotation teams, and (2) bootstrapping challenging creative generation tasks (e.g., explaining the underlying attributes of a text). In summary, LLMs are posed to meaningfully participate in social science analysis in partnership with humans.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior', 'abstract': 'Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative agents: computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent’s experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty-five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors. For example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine’s Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture—observation, planning, and reflection—each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Human-Centered AI', 'abstract': 'Abstract Researchers, developers, business leaders, policy makers, and others are expanding the technology-centered scope of artificial intelligence (AI) to include human-centered AI (HCAI) ways of thinking. This expansion from an algorithm-focused view to embrace a human-centered perspective can shape the future of technology so as to better serve human needs. Educators, designers, software engineers, product managers, evaluators, and government agency staffers can build on AI-driven technologies to design products and services that make life better for people and enable people to care for each other. Humans have always been tool builders, and now they are supertool builders, whose inventions can improve our health, family life, education, business, the environment, and much more. The remarkable progress in algorithms for machine and deep learning have opened the doors to new opportunities, and some dark possibilities. However, a bright future awaits AI researchers, developers, business leaders, policy makers, and others who build on their working methods by including HCAI strategies of design and testing. This enlarged vision can shape the future of technology so as to better serve human needs. As many technology companies and thought leaders have said, the goal is not to replace people, but to empower them by making design choices that give humans control over technology.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Using cognitive psychology to understand GPT-3', 'abstract': \"We study GPT-3, a recent large language model, using tools from cognitive psychology. More specifically, we assess GPT-3's decision-making, information search, deliberation, and causal reasoning abilities on a battery of canonical experiments from the literature. We find that much of GPT-3's behavior is impressive: It solves vignette-based tasks similarly or better than human subjects, is able to make decent decisions from descriptions, outperforms humans in a multiarmed bandit task, and shows signatures of model-based reinforcement learning. Yet, we also find that small perturbations to vignette-based tasks can lead GPT-3 vastly astray, that it shows no signatures of directed exploration, and that it fails miserably in a causal reasoning task. Taken together, these results enrich our understanding of current large language models and pave the way for future investigations using tools from cognitive psychology to study increasingly capable and opaque artificial agents.\"}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'ChatGPT outperforms crowd workers for text-annotation tasks', 'abstract': \"Many NLP applications require manual text annotations for a variety of tasks, notably to train classifiers or evaluate the performance of unsupervised models. Depending on the size and degree of complexity, the tasks may be conducted by crowd workers on platforms such as MTurk as well as trained annotators, such as research assistants. Using four samples of tweets and news articles (<i>n</i> = 6,183), we show that ChatGPT outperforms crowd workers for several annotation tasks, including relevance, stance, topics, and frame detection. Across the four datasets, the zero-shot accuracy of ChatGPT exceeds that of crowd workers by about 25 percentage points on average, while ChatGPT's intercoder agreement exceeds that of both crowd workers and trained annotators for all tasks. Moreover, the per-annotation cost of ChatGPT is less than $0.003-about thirty times cheaper than MTurk. These results demonstrate the potential of large language models to drastically increase the efficiency of text classification.\"}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'An MTurk Crisis? Shifts in Data Quality and the Impact on Study Results', 'abstract': 'Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is arguably one of the most important research tools of the past decade. The ability to rapidly collect large amounts of high-quality human subjects data has advanced multiple fields, including personality and social psychology. Beginning in summer 2018, concerns arose regarding MTurk data quality leading to questions about the utility of MTurk for psychological research. We present empirical evidence of a substantial decrease in data quality using a four-wave naturalistic experimental design: pre-, during, and post-summer 2018. During and to some extent post-summer 2018, we find significant increases in participants failing response validity indicators, decreases in reliability and validity of a widely used personality measure, and failures to replicate well-established findings. However, these detrimental effects can be mitigated by using response validity indicators and screening the data. We discuss implications and offer suggestions to ensure data quality.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'The Self‐Perception and Political Biases of ChatGPT', 'abstract': 'This contribution analyzes the self-perception and political biases of OpenAI’s Large Language Model ChatGPT. Considering the first small-scale reports and studies that have emerged, claiming that ChatGPT is politically biased towards progressive and libertarian points of view, this contribution is aimed at providing further clarity on this subject. Although the concept of political bias and affiliation is hard to define, lacking an agreed-upon measure for its quantification, this contribution attempts to examine this issue by having ChatGPT respond to questions on commonly used measures of political bias. In addition, further measures for personality traits that have previously been linked to political affiliations were examined. More specifically, ChatGPT was asked to answer the questions posed by the political compass test as well as similar questionnaires that are specific to the respective politics of the G7 member states. These eight tests were repeated ten times each and indicate that ChatGPT seems to hold a bias towards progressive views. The political compass test revealed a bias towards progressive and libertarian views, supporting the claims of prior research. The political questionnaires for the G7 member states indicated a bias towards progressive views but no significant bias between authoritarian and libertarian views, contradicting the findings of prior reports. In addition, ChatGPT’s Big Five personality traits were tested using the OCEAN test, and its personality type was queried using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test. Finally, the maliciousness of ChatGPT was evaluated using the Dark Factor test. These three tests were also repeated ten times each, revealing that ChatGPT perceives itself as highly open and agreeable, has the Myers-Briggs personality type ENFJ, and is among the test-takers with the least pronounced dark traits.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Artificial Hallucinations in ChatGPT: Implications in Scientific Writing', 'abstract': \"While still in its infancy, ChatGPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), introduced in November 2022, is bound to hugely impact many industries, including healthcare, medical education, biomedical research, and scientific writing. Implications of ChatGPT, that new chatbot introduced by OpenAI on academic writing, is largely unknown. In response to the Journal of Medical Science (Cureus) Turing Test - call for case reports written with the assistance of ChatGPT, we present two cases one of homocystinuria-associated osteoporosis, and the other is on late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), a rare metabolic disorder. We tested ChatGPT to write about the pathogenesis of these conditions. We documented the positive, negative, and rather troubling aspects of our newly introduced chatbot's performance.\"}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Performance of ChatGPT on USMLE: Potential for AI-assisted medical education using large language models', 'abstract': 'We evaluated the performance of a large language model called ChatGPT on the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE), which consists of three exams: Step 1, Step 2CK, and Step 3. ChatGPT performed at or near the passing threshold for all three exams without any specialized training or reinforcement. Additionally, ChatGPT demonstrated a high level of concordance and insight in its explanations. These results suggest that large language models may have the potential to assist with medical education, and potentially, clinical decision-making.'}]\n```\n\n**Part A.2: The Evolution Links (Edges of the Graph):**\nThe following list defines the citation relationships between the papers in Part A.

Analyze how the core problems and methods have evolved through the papers (A.1). Synthesize this evolutionary understanding with the local (Part B) and global (Part C) context. This deep understanding will be the foundation for your final report.\n\n**Step 2: Generate the Final Research Landscape Map (This is your ONLY output)**\nNow, based on the deep insights gained from your internal analysis in Step 1, generate a concise and insightful report. The report **MUST** contain ONLY the following three sections:\n\n**1. Current Research Landscape & Core Consensus:**\n- What is the central problem and dominant methodology of the **current** state-of-the-art? Your summary should reflect the insights from the evolutionary analysis (e.g., 'the current focus on X is a direct response to the limitations of the earlier Y').\n- Use the Central Nodes (B.1) and Thematic Islands (B.2) to support your summary.\n\n**2. Critical Gaps & Unexplored Frontiers:**\n- **Internal Gaps:** What limitations are present in the recent papers? What weaknesses are revealed by the overall evolutionary trajectory (e.g., 'the field has consistently overlooked problem Z throughout its evolution')?\n- **External/Novel Gaps:** Based on the Global Context (Part C), what novel connections or cross-disciplinary approaches have been overlooked?\n\n**3.

    "title": "Research Landscape Map: Evaluating Current LLMs on Benchmark NLP Tasks for Performance Reliability",
    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem in the current state-of-the-art research is the reliable evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on natural language processing (NLP) tasks, encompassing not only technical performance metrics but also cognitive, psychological, and social dimensions such as personality traits, political bias, and self-perception. This multifaceted evaluation approach reflects a maturity beyond early performance benchmarks and acknowledges both the strengths and shortcomings of LLMs like GPT-3 and ChatGPT. Dominant methodologies focus on broad benchmarking across diverse NLP tasks, zero-shot classification effectiveness, and human-centered evaluation paradigms, including crowd worker comparisons and cognitive psychology tools. The research is organized into thematic islands addressing political bias and personality traits, evaluation methods for processing tasks, data annotation efficiency using crowd workers and platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), and cognitive psychological assessments of LLM behavior. This comprehensive approach directly responds to limitations in earlier works which emphasized purely technical or task-specific evaluation without integrating human cognitive and societal implications.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps include inconsistent reliability and generalizability of LLM evaluations: small perturbations in task design can mislead model performance (e.g., in causal reasoning), and hallucinations or factual inaccuracies persist, undermining trustworthiness. Significant challenges arise from the limitations of traditional annotation methods (such as MTurk) highlighted by data quality declines, which impact training and evaluation validity. Furthermore, existing evaluation paradigms often overlook nuanced biases embedded in LLMs, such as political leanings and personality trait embeddings, limiting understanding of their societal and ethical impacts. External gaps revealed by global context analysis point to underexplored interdisciplinary linkages—particularly the fusion of political bias analysis with language processing tasks using advanced entity embeddings and state-of-the-art supervised models. There is also a paucity of research integrating human-centered AI testing frameworks with large-scale cognitive and psychological assessments. Additionally, synergy between annotation quality issues and political or personality biases in datasets remains inadequately addressed, indicating a need for improved cross-domain analytic frameworks.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "1. Develop integrated evaluation frameworks that combine cognitive psychology methods with NLP benchmarking to systematically assess not only task accuracy but also reasoning, decision-making, and bias manifestation in LLMs. This bridges the gap between purely technical and human-centered assessments, leveraging insights such as those from model-based reinforcement learning signatures and personality trait analysis.\n\n2. Create hybrid annotation and evaluation pipelines that leverage LLMs like ChatGPT as zero-shot annotators to mitigate the observed decline and inconsistency in human crowdworker data quality (e.g., MTurk crises), while incorporating political bias detection modules to ensure balanced and ethically sound training data.\n\n3. Design novel computational models and linguistic representations that explicitly connect political bias dimensions with NLP processing tasks through entity embeddings and advanced supervised models, thereby enabling more transparent and interpretable evaluation metrics relevant for societal impact assessments. This addresses the external interdisciplinary opportunities emerging from data management, psychology, and communication studies realms."
