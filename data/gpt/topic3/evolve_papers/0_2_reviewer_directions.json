    "title": "Entity-Embedding Enhanced Political Bias Transparent Evaluation Model",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing evaluation metrics for LLMs inadequately capture intertwined political bias within linguistic representations, causing a blind spot in social impact assessments.",
    "Motivation": "Directly addresses the external critical gap of lacking fused political bias and language processing models by proposing new architectures linking entity embeddings and supervised bias-aware evaluations, fulfilling the identified interdisciplinary opportunity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a model architecture that jointly learns linguistic task performance with disentangled political-entity embeddings. This involves augmenting token embeddings with political polarity vectors derived from politically annotated corpora. Introduce transparency modules outputting interpretable bias scores alongside task accuracy, enabling evaluators to gauge societal impact risks effectively.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compile politically annotated datasets with entity-level labels; 2) Train baseline LLMs on standard NLP tasks; 3) Integrate entity-political embeddings into language models; 4) Develop supervised bias detection heads; 5) Evaluate using novel combined metrics balancing performance and bias scores; 6) Conduct user studies on interpretability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentiment classification on a political news article mentioning 'Senator X'. Output includes traditional sentiment score plus a political bias embedding score indicating lean towards liberal or conservative perspectives with confidence intervals.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If embedding fusion reduces task accuracy significantly, propose a decoupled pipeline with post-hoc bias detection layers to maintain performance while adding transparency."
