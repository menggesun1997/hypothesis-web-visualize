    "title": "Dynamic Prompt Engineering for Bias Mitigation and Evaluation",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM evaluations are sensitive to minor design perturbations, causing inconsistency in bias measurement and task performance outcomes.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gaps of evaluation inconsistency and bias detection reliability by introducing dynamically adaptive prompts that systematically control for and reveal biases and decision-making stability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an automated prompt engineering system generating controlled perturbations and bias-contextual variants. The system evaluates LLM output variability under these perturbations to quantify robustness, bias strengths, and hallucination tendencies, feeding into a meta-evaluation layer for performance reliability assessment.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop prompt transformation rules encoding political/personality bias contexts; 2) Test on multiple LLMs across classification and reasoning tasks; 3) Measure output variance, bias shifts, and hallucination rates; 4) Validate reliability scores against human annotations; 5) Iterate prompt generation to maximize diagnostic value.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input prompt about a politically charged topic is rephrased dynamically; output sentiment and bias scores compared across prompt versions to quantify stability.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic prompts induce too much noise, refine perturbation parameters and limit scope to critical bias-sensitive contexts only."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks detailed clarity on how the automated prompt engineering system will algorithmically generate the controlled perturbations and bias-contextual variants. It is important to specify the mechanisms or models used to create these perturbations, how they ensure systematic control over biases, and how the meta-evaluation layer will aggregate and interpret output variability to yield reliable bias and hallucination metrics. Providing concrete algorithmic or architectural details will strengthen the soundness of the approach and the credibility of the bias quantification claims, facilitating reproducibility and understanding of the systemâ€™s workings and limitations.\n\nRecommendation: Elaborate on the generation process for dynamic prompts (e.g., rule-based, learned transformations, or hybrid), describe how bias contexts are embedded or parameterized, and explain the design and computation within the meta-evaluation layer for robustness quantification and bias strength measurement. Clarify how hallucination tendencies are detected and connected to prompt variations within this pipeline."

Critical aspects needing refinement include:\n\n- Specification of which LLMs will be tested, their sizes, and APIs or platforms used.\n- Definitions and metrics for measuring output variance, bias shifts, and hallucination rates, including ground truth or annotation protocols.\n- Design of human annotation studies: scale, annotator expertise, agreement metrics.\n- Quantitative criteria for iterating prompt generation to maximize diagnostic value.\n\nFurthermore, the fallback plan is vague, suggesting only reducing noise and narrowing focus without concrete criteria or procedures. To improve feasibility, incorporating preliminary small-scale experiments or pilot studies to calibrate perturbation parameters and assess noise impact should be included.\n\nRecommendation: Augment the experiment plan with detailed operational protocols, metrics, LLM selections, annotation methodologies, and explicit iteration cycles. Provide success criteria and risk mitigation strategies beyond general fallback suggestions to enhance execution confidence."
