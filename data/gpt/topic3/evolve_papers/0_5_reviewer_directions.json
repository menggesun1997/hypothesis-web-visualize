    "title": "Personality Trait Embedding Probes for LLM Benchmarking",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs embed nuanced personality traits but current benchmarks do not systematically detect or evaluate these traits, limiting understanding of model social behavior and reliability.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap of overlooked personality biases and the opportunity of developing cognitive psychology informed benchmarks, advancing beyond surface-level task accuracy to social cognition metrics.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop personality trait embedding probes derived from computational psychometrics to embed and extract Big Five personality dimensions from LLM generated text. Integrate these probes into NLP benchmarking pipelines to quantify trait consistency, stability, and influence on task performance and bias patterns.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Create personality trait-labeled prompt sets; 2) Generate responses from multiple LLMs; 3) Use embedding probes to quantify trait signals; 4) Correlate with task outcomes and bias scores; 5) Compare with human personality assessment data; 6) Explore impacts on downstream applications like dialogue systems.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Prompt: 'Describe how you would handle a disagreement.' Expected: Responses with trait embedding scores indicating high agreeableness or openness, validated across models.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If personality embedding probes lack sensitivity, consider hybrid human-machine annotation schemes with expert psychometricians."

          "feedback_content": "The assumption that LLM-generated text contains stable and reliably extractable Big Five personality trait signals is ambitious and underexplored. Current LLMs optimize for task performance and often generate context-dependent, non-consistent responses rather than consistent personality expressions. The proposal should explicitly address how to disambiguate personality trait signals from prompt style or task effects, and provide stronger theoretical or preliminary evidence supporting this core assumption to ensure soundness of the method's foundation. Without this, the validity of the embedding probes and their interpretability for personality traits may be questionable, undermining the benchmarking goals. Consider incorporating diagnostic checks or controls to isolate genuine personality trait embeddings in responses versus superficial stylistic cues or random variation in generated text behaviors, which may confound trait quantifications and downstream correlations with biases or task outcomes. This is critical to justify the entire approach's premise before investing in large-scale evaluation and integration into benchmarks for social cognition metrics in LLMs (target section: Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "To enhance impact and novelty in this competitive space, integrate established psychometric inventories such as Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) or computational psychometrics from personality research directly into the embedding probe construction and validation pipeline. Link personality trait embeddings explicitly with linguistic feature sets and sentiment analysis facets from these inventories for richer, multi-dimensional trait extraction. Additionally, incorporate training-based methods that adapt probes to different LLM architectures and fine-tuning regimes to improve generalizability. For benchmarking relevance, consider extending applications into natural language query systems and personalized dialogue agents, leveraging personality trait signals to tailor interactions dynamically. This integration will not only strengthen the scientific validity but also expand the utility and adoption potential of the proposed probes in NLP tasks, broadening impact and overcoming the novelty challenge (target section: Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan)."
