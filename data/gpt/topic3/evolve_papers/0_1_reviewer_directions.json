    "title": "LLM-Assisted Hybrid Annotation for Bias-Controlled Dataset Curation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Crowdsourced annotations (e.g., MTurk) for NLP benchmarks suffer from quality decline and inconsistent political bias representation, limiting dataset reliability for model training and evaluation.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap regarding declining annotation quality and bias issues, supporting the high-potential innovation of hybrid annotation pipelines combining LLM zero-shot annotation with human oversight and bias detection.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a hybrid annotation pipeline where LLMs generate initial zero-shot annotations for large unlabeled datasets, followed by partial human verification and refinement focused on detecting and balancing political bias. Integrate bias detection models that flag potential skewed outputs and dynamically adjust LLM prompts for correction in iterative rounds.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select politically sensitive NLP datasets (e.g., hate speech, opinion mining); 2) Use GPT-4 or similar LLMs for zero-shot annotation; 3) Develop bias detection classifiers for political leaning; 4) Conduct human verification on flagged items; 5) Retrain LLM annotator prompts accordingly; 6) Evaluate dataset quality and balance by downstream task performance and bias metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A tweet expressing a contentious political opinion. Zero-shot LLM annotation labels sentiment and stance. Bias detection flags overly skewed or subjective labeling, triggering human review and balanced reassignment.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If LLM zero-shot annotations prove unreliable, fallback to semi-supervised active learning with crowd annotations prioritized only on ambiguous or biased flagged samples for cost efficiency."

          "feedback_content": "The assumption that LLM zero-shot annotations can reliably generate large-scale initial labels with a manageable rate of bias and quality errors may be optimistic. Given the contentious nature of politically sensitive data, the current approach lacks a detailed error analysis strategy to validate this assumption upfront. Additionally, the proposal assumes that bias detection classifiers can effectively flag political skew without extensive labeled data or sophisticated debiasing techniques, which needs clearer justification or prior evidence to ensure soundness of the core approach. Strengthening this part with preliminary feasibility studies or referencing existing empirical results would enhance confidence in the foundational assumptions and overall soundness of the method's premise and pipeline design.  This is critical since the entire hybrid pipeline depends on trustable initial labeling and reliable bias detection to function effectively as proposed, and overlooking these risks may impair the method's viability or evaluation validity in practice.  Please clarify and support these assumptions explicitly in the proposal to improve soundness of the core idea and its technical foundation in the Proposed_Method and Problem_Statement sections. Â "

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan currently lacks specificity on dataset sizes, annotation budget, and concrete evaluation protocols, making it difficult to assess practical feasibility. In particular, details regarding the calibration and iterative retraining of LLM prompts based on human verification are sparse and could benefit from clearer operationalization (e.g., how many iterations, which criteria trigger prompt adjustments, and quantitative thresholds for bias flags). Without this, it is unclear whether the hybrid pipeline will be practically scalable or cost-effective compared to traditional annotation methods. Including more precise experimental design elements such as defining success criteria, specifying human verification ratios, and outlining fallback integration steps (especially for the semi-supervised fallback) would improve the rigor and replicability of the experiments. Strengthening feasibility will help ensure the proposed method's claims can be empirically validated and adopted in real-world dataset curation contexts, especially given the potentially high costs involved in human-in-the-loop political bias-sensitive annotation tasks."
