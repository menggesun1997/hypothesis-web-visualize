    "title": "Interactive Human-in-the-Loop Scalable Evaluation via Synthetic Domain-Aware Probing",
    "Problem_Statement": "Human evaluation for domain-specific adaptation of LLMs is costly and unscalable, limiting the ability to assess task performance robustness and factuality with high fidelity.",
    "Motivation": "We address the critical external gap of expensive and unscalable human evaluation by proposing a novel synthetic domain-aware probing paradigm that mimics human judgments at scale, reducing dependence on manual annotation and complementing imperfect automatic metrics.",
    "Proposed_Method": "The method automatically generates domain-aware synthetic test probes by perturbing real domain data with controlled factual errors, inconsistencies, and style variations using learned transformation models. A small seed of human annotations is used to train a meta-evaluator that predicts human-like quality and consistency scores on generated probes. This evaluator assists large-scale robust assessment of adapted LLM outputs via calibration and interactive refinement with human reviewers focusing only on ambiguous or high-uncertainty cases.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect domain-specific corpora and seed human evaluations on generated errors. 2) Train error generators and meta-evaluator models. 3) Evaluate meta-evaluator alignment with human judgments on held-out samples. 4) Deploy hybrid human–machine evaluation pipeline and benchmark against existing metrics. 5) Perform ablation on probe diversity and human workload reduction.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Summaries generated by adapted LLM with introduced factual errors versus gold references. Output: Predicted human-like scores accurately ranking summaries’ factuality and consistency aligning with real expert evaluations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If synthetic probing lacks realism, incorporate adversarial data generation or generative data augmentation informed by domain experts, or refine meta-evaluator with active learning from human feedback."
