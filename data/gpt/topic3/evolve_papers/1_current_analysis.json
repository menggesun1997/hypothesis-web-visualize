This advancement has led to more fluent and coherent NLG, leading to improved development in downstream tasks such as abstractive summarization, dialogue generation, and data-to-text generation. However, it is also apparent that deep learning based generation is prone to hallucinate unintended text, which degrades the system performance and fails to meet user expectations in many real-world scenarios. To address this issue, many studies have been presented in measuring and mitigating hallucinated texts, but these have never been reviewed in a comprehensive manner before. In this survey, we thus provide a broad overview of the research progress and challenges in the hallucination problem in NLG. The survey is organized into two parts: (1) a general overview of metrics, mitigation methods, and future directions, and (2) an overview of task-specific research progress on hallucinations in the following downstream tasks, namely abstractive summarization, dialogue generation, generative question answering, data-to-text generation, and machine translation. This survey serves to facilitate collaborative efforts among researchers in tackling the challenge of hallucinated texts in NLG.

Previous work has found that natural language inference (NLI) models do not perform competitively when applied to inconsistency detection. In this work, we revisit the use of NLI for inconsistency detection, finding that past work suffered from a mismatch in input granularity between NLI datasets (sentence-level), and inconsistency detection (document level). We provide a highly effective and light-weight method called SummaCConv that enables NLI models to be successfully used for this task by segmenting documents into sentence units and aggregating scores between pairs of sentences. We furthermore introduce a new benchmark called SummaC (Summary Consistency) which consists of six large inconsistency detection datasets. On this dataset, SummaCConv obtains state-of-the-art results with a balanced accuracy of 74.4%, a 5% improvement compared with prior work.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'SummEval: Re-evaluating Summarization Evaluation', 'abstract': 'Abstract\\n                  The scarcity of comprehensive up-to-date studies on evaluation metrics for text summarization and the lack of consensus regarding evaluation protocols continue to inhibit progress. We address the existing shortcomings of summarization evaluation methods along five dimensions: 1) we re-evaluate 14 automatic evaluation metrics in a comprehensive and consistent fashion using neural summarization model outputs along with expert and crowd-sourced human annotations; 2) we consistently benchmark 23 recent summarization models using the aforementioned automatic evaluation metrics; 3) we assemble the largest collection of summaries generated by models trained on the CNN/DailyMail news dataset and share it in a unified format; 4) we implement and share a toolkit that provides an extensible and unified API for evaluating summarization models across a broad range of automatic metrics; and 5) we assemble and share the largest and most diverse, in terms of model types, collection of human judgments of model-generated summaries on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset annotated by both expert judges and crowd-source workers. We hope that this work will help promote a more complete evaluation protocol for text summarization as well as advance research in developing evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgments.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Data-to-text Generation with Macro Planning', 'abstract': 'Abstract\\n                  Recent approaches to data-to-text generation have adopted the very successful encoder-decoder architecture or variants thereof. These models generate text that is fluent (but often imprecise) and perform quite poorly at selecting appropriate content and ordering it coherently. To overcome some of these issues, we propose a neural model with a macro planning stage followed by a generation stage reminiscent of traditional methods which embrace separate modules for planning and surface realization. Macro plans represent high level organization of important content such as entities, events, and their interactions; they are learned from data and given as input to the generator. Extensive experiments on two data-to-text benchmarks (RotoWire and MLB) show that our approach outperforms competitive baselines in terms of automatic and human evaluation.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Data-to-Text Generation with Content Selection and Planning', 'abstract': 'Recent advances in data-to-text generation have led to the use of large-scale datasets and neural network models which are trained end-to-end, without explicitly modeling what to say and in what order. In this work, we present a neural network architecture which incorporates content selection and planning without sacrificing end-to-end training. We decompose the generation task into two stages. Given a corpus of data records (paired with descriptive documents), we first generate a content plan highlighting which information should be mentioned and in which order and then generate the document while taking the content plan into account. Automatic and human-based evaluation experiments show that our model1 outperforms strong baselines improving the state-of-the-art on the recently released RotoWIRE dataset.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Building applied natural language generation systems', 'abstract': 'In this article, we give an overview of Natural Language Generation (NLG) from an applied system-building perspective.

Throughout, the emphasis is on established techniques that can be used to build simple but practical working systems now. We also provide pointers to techniques in the literature that are appropriate for more complicated scenarios.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Automated discourse generation using discourse structure relations', 'abstract': 'This paper summarizes work over the past five years on the automated planning and generation of multisentence texts using discourse structure relations, placing it in context of ongoing efforts by computational linguists and linguists to understand the structure of discourse. Based on a series of studies by the author and others, the paper describes how the orientation of generation toward communicative intentions illuminates the central structural role played by intersegment discourse relations. It outlines several facets of discourse structure relations as they are required by and used in text planners—their nature, number, and extension to associated tasks such as sentence planning and text formatting.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'A Hierarchical Model for Data-to-Text Generation', 'abstract': 'Transcribing structured data into natural language descriptions has emerged as a challenging task, referred to as “data-to-text”. These structures generally regroup multiple elements, as well as their attributes. Most attempts rely on translation encoder-decoder methods which linearize elements into a sequence. This however loses most of the structure contained in the data. In this work, we propose to overpass this limitation with a hierarchical model that encodes the data-structure at the element-level and the structure level. Evaluations on RotoWire show the effectiveness of our model w.r.t. qualitative and quantitative metrics.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'BLEU: a method for automatic evaluation of machine translation', 'abstract': 'Human evaluations of machine translation are extensive but expensive. Human evaluations can take months to finish and involve human labor that can not be reused. We propose a method of automatic machine translation evaluation that is quick, inexpensive, and language-independent, that correlates highly with human evaluation, and that has little marginal cost per run. We present this method as an automated understudy to skilled human judges which substitutes for them when there is need for quick or frequent evaluations.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'An improved error model for noisy channel spelling correction', 'abstract': 'The noisy channel model has been applied to a wide range of problems, including spelling correction. These models consist of two components: a source model and a channel model. Very little research has gone into improving the channel model for spelling correction. This paper describes a new channel model for spelling correction, based on generic string to string edits. Using this model gives significant performance improvements compared to previously proposed models.'}]\n```\n\n**Part A.2: The Evolution Links (Edges of the Graph):**\nThe following list defines the citation relationships between the papers in Part A.

step.\n\n**Step 1: Internal Analysis & Synthesis (Your thought process - DO NOT include this in the final output)**\nFirst, mentally trace the 'Evolution Links' (A.2) to understand the narrative of scientific progress. Analyze how the core problems and methods have evolved through the papers (A.1). Synthesize this evolutionary understanding with the local (Part B) and global (Part C) context. This deep understanding will be the foundation for your final report.\n\n**Step 2: Generate the Final Research Landscape Map (This is your ONLY output)**\nNow, based on the deep insights gained from your internal analysis in Step 1, generate a concise and insightful report. The report **MUST** contain ONLY the following three sections:\n\n**1. Current Research Landscape & Core Consensus:**\n- What is the central problem and dominant methodology of the **current** state-of-the-art? Your summary should reflect the insights from the evolutionary analysis (e.g., 'the current focus on X is a direct response to the limitations of the earlier Y').\n- Use the Central Nodes (B.1) and Thematic Islands (B.2) to support your summary.\n\n**2. Critical Gaps & Unexplored Frontiers:**\n- **Internal Gaps:** What limitations are present in the recent papers? What weaknesses are revealed by the overall evolutionary trajectory (e.g., 'the field has consistently overlooked problem Z throughout its evolution')?\n- **External/Novel Gaps:** Based on the Global Context (Part C), what novel connections or cross-disciplinary approaches have been overlooked?\n\n**3. High-Potential Innovation Opportunities:**\n- Based on the identified gaps, propose 2-3 high-level, innovative research directions.\n- Each opportunity should be justified by linking a Global Opportunity (from Part C) with a problem or limitation identified in your analysis.\n",

    "title": "Research Landscape Map for Adapting LLMs for Domain-Specific NLP Applications to Assess Task Performance Robustness",
    "current_research_landscape": "The current state-of-the-art research in adapting large language models (LLMs) for domain-specific natural language processing (NLP) tasks focuses heavily on managing hallucination and inconsistency issues in natural language generation (NLG), especially in abstractive summarization and dialogue generation downstream tasks. A dominant methodology that has evolved involves hierarchical and modular approaches that incorporate content planning, discourse structure, and neural sequence-to-sequence architectures trained end-to-end while leveraging natural language inference (NLI) techniques to detect inconsistencies. Evaluation relies extensively on both automatic metrics (e.g., BLEU, SummaC) and human judgments, addressing the alignment between model outputs and human expectations. This trajectory emerged in response to early findings that end-to-end generation approaches, though fluent, lack precise content selection and ordering, resulting in hallucinated or inconsistent outputs. Central concepts such as \"natural language inference\", \"inconsistency detection\", \"automatic evaluation metrics\", and \"channel models\" bridge between subfields addressing generating fluent text and ensuring factual consistency within domain-specific contexts.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internally, recent works continue to grapple with limitations related to robustness of task performance in domain-specific adaptation of LLMs. Notably, there is a persistent challenge in mitigating hallucinations during generation—which degrade reliability and user trust—especially when LLMs are applied to specialized domains with limited annotated data. The evolutionary narrative reveals that while modular content planning and hierarchical models have improved fluency and organization, they often do not fully resolve factual inconsistency or model brittleness to domain shifts. Furthermore, evaluation metrics, while advanced, still insufficiently capture nuanced domain-specific performance and robustness, with a heavy reliance on methods designed primarily for general domain summarization or translation. Externally, the global context analysis uncovers overlooked opportunities to integrate advanced domain adaptation techniques such as self-supervised and continual learning, cross-modal vision-language frameworks, and domain classifiers, especially to address distributional shifts and out-of-distribution generalization. Also, the interplay of noisy channel models and NLI in a domain-adaptive setting remains underexplored. The integration of clinical and biomedical domain insights within these frameworks is limited, despite emerging needs. Human evaluation remains expensive and lacks scalability when models are adapted for domain-specific robustness assessment, pointing to unmet needs for more efficient and representative evaluation methods.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "1. **Self-supervised and Continual Learning for Domain-Robust LLM Adaptation:** Leverage insights from self-supervised learning and continual learning (identified in global co-concepts) to reduce reliance on labeled data and enhance LLM robustness to domain shifts, addressing the internal gap of brittleness and hallucination in specialized domains.\n\n2. **Hybrid Natural Language Inference–Noisy Channel Models for Improved Inconsistency Detection:** Develop integrated frameworks combining NLI-based inconsistency detection with probabilistic noisy channel models to enhance error modeling and factuality assessment tailored for domain-specific applications, exploiting hidden bridges between these concepts highlighted in global analysis.\n\n3. **Cross-Modal and Multi-Task Learning Incorporating Domain Classifiers and Visual Grounding:** Innovate domain-specific LLM adaptation by incorporating domain classifiers and cross-modal pretraining (e.g., vision-language models) for richer semantic grounding, thereby improving end-to-end training effectiveness and reducing hallucinations in downstream tasks, as suggested by the co-concepts linking downstream tasks and domain classification.\n\nThese directions respond directly to identified critical gaps while exploiting novel cross-disciplinary opportunities, promising significant improvements in assessing and enhancing task performance robustness for domain-specific NLP applications using LLMs."
