        "title": "Multidimensional Evaluation Framework Integrating Health and Education Metrics for Retrieval-Augmented LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluation frameworks for retrieval-augmented generation outputs lack multidimensional rigor, particularly missing domain-aware quality and ethical transparency measures inspired by health sciences and education assessment standards. This limits reliable assessment of accuracy, fairness, and trustworthiness of generated outputs in sensitive domains.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap in rigorous testing frameworks by integrating institutional review and academic competence measures from health sciences and education. This cross-disciplinary synthesis introduces novel evaluation dimensions beyond conventional NLP accuracy.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a composite evaluation framework combining traditional NLP metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, factuality) with domain-specific standards inspired by health (clinical trial safety, protocol adherence) and education (student assessment rubrics, critical thinking indicators). The framework uses modular scoring components and ethical transparency checklists, supported by an explainable dashboard for retrieval-augmented LLM outputs.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate datasets from healthcare-related and educational NLP tasks supplemented with retrieval-augmented outputs.\n2. Implement baseline evaluation using current standard NLP metrics.\n3. Develop and integrate health and education-inspired evaluation modules.\n4. Conduct comparative analyses measuring improvements in evaluation expressiveness, consistency, and ethical detection.\n5. Validate user trust and interpretability with domain expert feedback.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A retrieval-augmented LLM generates clinical trial eligibility criteria from patient data.\nExpected Output: Evaluation report quantifying factual accuracy, adherence to trial protocols, and transparency metrics indicating risk of biased or opaque generation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If modular evaluation components show low correlation with domain expert judgment, pivot to iterative refinement involving more expert-in-the-loop feedback or explore automated evaluation proxies based on proxy annotations."

        "Problem_Statement": "Integrating private, proprietary, or sensitive domain data into retrieval-augmented LLMs risks violating data privacy, limiting adoption in regulated industries due to lack of secure frameworks managing data access during generation.",
        "Motivation": "Directly tackles the external gap on private data integration with information technology industry advances, leveraging decentralized access control and blockchain for privacy preservation, enabling ethical, legal compliance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a decentralized retrieval architecture where domain-specific data remains siloed but accessible through smart contract-based permissioned queries. Combine encrypted indexing and retrieval with on-chain audit trails ensuring traceability and consent compliance. Integrate this secure retrieval module with open LLMs enabling privacy-preserving generation without raw data exposure.",

Implement encrypted indexes and smart contract governed retrieval system.\n3. Integrate with open-source LLM for retrieval-augmented generation.\n4. Benchmark accuracy compared to non-private baselines.\n5. Audit privacy guarantees and compliance metrics under simulated attack scenarios.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Request for patient-specific diagnosis generation with access restricted to authorized clinicians.\nExpected Output: Generated clinical notes derived only from permitted data, with auditable access logs ensuring no data leakage.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain introduces performance overhead, investigate hybrid off-chain solutions or secure multi-party computation protocols to balance efficiency and privacy."

        "Proposed_Method": "Propose a transfer learning framework enabling retrieval modules pretrained on industry-agnostic corpora to be fine-tuned with domain-specific knowledge graphs and documents related to environmental, commercial, and management data. Tailor generation prompts and retrieval embeddings to enhance context relevance and narrative coherence for organizational stakeholders.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multi-industry datasets focusing on environmental disclosures and corporate reports.\n2. Pretrain retrieval modules on generic datasets.\n3.
