    "title": "Multidimensional Evaluation Framework Integrating Health and Education Metrics for Retrieval-Augmented LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluation frameworks for retrieval-augmented generation outputs lack multidimensional rigor, particularly missing domain-aware quality and ethical transparency measures inspired by health sciences and education assessment standards. This limits reliable assessment of accuracy, fairness, and trustworthiness of generated outputs in sensitive domains.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap in rigorous testing frameworks by integrating institutional review and academic competence measures from health sciences and education. This cross-disciplinary synthesis introduces novel evaluation dimensions beyond conventional NLP accuracy.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a composite evaluation framework combining traditional NLP metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, factuality) with domain-specific standards inspired by health (clinical trial safety, protocol adherence) and education (student assessment rubrics, critical thinking indicators). The framework uses modular scoring components and ethical transparency checklists, supported by an explainable dashboard for retrieval-augmented LLM outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate datasets from healthcare-related and educational NLP tasks supplemented with retrieval-augmented outputs.\n2. Implement baseline evaluation using current standard NLP metrics.\n3. Develop and integrate health and education-inspired evaluation modules.\n4. Conduct comparative analyses measuring improvements in evaluation expressiveness, consistency, and ethical detection.\n5. Validate user trust and interpretability with domain expert feedback.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A retrieval-augmented LLM generates clinical trial eligibility criteria from patient data.\nExpected Output: Evaluation report quantifying factual accuracy, adherence to trial protocols, and transparency metrics indicating risk of biased or opaque generation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If modular evaluation components show low correlation with domain expert judgment, pivot to iterative refinement involving more expert-in-the-loop feedback or explore automated evaluation proxies based on proxy annotations."

          "feedback_content": "While the step-by-step plan to integrate health and education domain standards into an evaluation framework is well structured, it currently lacks detail about how to operationalize and validate the new modular evaluation components in a scalable, reproducible manner. Specifically, the plan should elaborate how datasets will be curated to reflect diverse, representative retrieval-augmented generation scenarios within both domains, and how exactly domain expert feedback will be systematically collected and quantified to ensure robust validation beyond anecdotal assessment. Addressing these points will strengthen confidence in feasibility and reproducibility of the approach at scale, which is essential given the complexity of multidimensional and ethically sensitive evaluation metrics involved.\n\nRecommendation: Define clear criteria for dataset selection and annotation process, specify quantitative measures for expert validation (e.g., inter-rater agreement, statistical tests), and outline resource estimates for expert involvement to better signal practicability and scientific rigor in the experimental plan. This will fortify the experiment's design against feasibility pitfalls and improve clarity for reproducibility and future adoption prospects within the research community.\n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty screening indicated a competitive space with similar integration attempts, a concrete opportunity to enhance both impact and originality lies in explicitly incorporating concepts from the linked fields such as 'attribute-based access control' and 'security of electronic health records'. By embedding security and privacy standards from health informatics into the evaluation framework, the research can address trustworthiness and compliance rigorously, which is a critical and underexplored dimension in retrieval-augmented LLM evaluation.\n\nConcretely, extending the framework to evaluate whether generated outputs respect data access restrictions and confidentiality constraints could differentiate this work. Connecting evaluation metrics to intelligent decision-making systems used in clinical and educational contexts could further broaden impact, appealing to interdisciplinary audiences. Including these aspects would reinforce the ethical transparency measures and align with real-world deployment challenges faced by AI in sensitive domains.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
