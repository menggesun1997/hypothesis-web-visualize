    "title": "Integration of Imbalanced Learning with Prompt Catalogs for Few-Shot Software NLP Tasks",
    "Problem_Statement": "Few-shot and imbalanced data scenarios in software engineering NLP tasks lead to unreliable LLM performance when computational efficiency is prioritized, due to underexplored model adaptation and robustness strategies.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap on low-resource robustness by systematically integrating imbalanced learning methods directly into the prompt catalog and semantic augmentation pipelines, creating better balanced and robust prompt strategies for few-shot learning with LLMs in software NLP.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Extend prompt catalogs with imbalance-aware augmentation techniques such as synthetic minority oversampling prompts, cost-sensitive semantic enrichments, and dynamic repetition weighting within few-shot settings. Embed a feedback control system monitoring class distributions to adjust prompt selection probabilities dynamically, aiming to improve output reliability under constrained computational budgets.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Use software engineering datasets with severe label imbalance. 2) Implement baseline few-shot prompting. 3) Design imbalance-aware prompt augmentations and control logic. 4) Evaluate with precision, recall, F-measure, and compute resource usage. 5) Conduct experiments varying imbalance ratios. 6) Benchmark against state-of-the-art few-shot learning techniques.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Rare security vulnerability report needing classification. Expected output: Correct classification despite rare class with fewer prompt tokens and maintained reliability.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If imbalance-aware prompt integration underperforms, fallback to ensemble prompting with specialized prompts per class, or integrate external imbalance-aware classifiers as post-processing to boost recall on rare classes."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines several imbalance-aware augmentation techniques and a feedback control system to adjust prompt selection, but lacks detailed explanation of how these components interact and function in practice. For instance, the mechanism of synthetic minority oversampling prompts and dynamic repetition weighting needs clearer formalization, including mathematical or algorithmic details. Additionally, how the feedback control system quantitatively monitors class distributions and influences prompt probabilities should be explicitly described to ensure reproducibility and soundness of the approach. Clarifying these mechanisms will improve understanding and strengthen the work's credibility and implementation feasibility, especially under constrained computational budgets targeted by the problem statement. Consider providing pseudo-code or a flowchart outlining the control loop and integration of augmentation methods within prompt catalogs for transparency and thorough evaluation purposes.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screened novelty as NOV-COMPETITIVE, the idea's impact and differentiation could be enhanced by connecting the imbalance-aware prompting strategy with uncertainty-aware techniques or multimodal learning approaches cited in the globally-linked concepts. For example, incorporating uncertainty estimation to dynamically prioritize or weight prompts could further increase robustness in few-shot scenarios with imbalanced classes. Alternatively, extending the approach to leverage multimodal inputs such as source code snippets alongside textual vulnerability reports may enrich prompt catalog effectiveness and generalization. Exploring these integrations may elevate the contribution beyond typical imbalanced learning and prompt engineering combinations, potentially addressing broader challenges in software vulnerability detection or code analysis. This alignment with state-of-the-art areas would heighten the novelty and impact of the research, making it more competitive for premier venues."
