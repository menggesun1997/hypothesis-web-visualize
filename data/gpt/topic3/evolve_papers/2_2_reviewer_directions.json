    "title": "Cross-Industry Transfer Learning Framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Organizational Digital Transformation",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs enhanced by retrieval methods are underutilized in specific industry domains undergoing digital transformation, particularly where environmental information disclosure or management insights are critical, resulting in suboptimal contextualization and impact on decision-making.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the external gap by leveraging cross-disciplinary linkages among commerce, management, environment, and AI text generation to create domain-adaptive, transformation-oriented retrieval-augmented generation models, enhancing AI practical business relevance.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Propose a transfer learning framework enabling retrieval modules pretrained on industry-agnostic corpora to be fine-tuned with domain-specific knowledge graphs and documents related to environmental, commercial, and management data. Tailor generation prompts and retrieval embeddings to enhance context relevance and narrative coherence for organizational stakeholders.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multi-industry datasets focusing on environmental disclosures and corporate reports.\n2. Pretrain retrieval modules on generic datasets.\n3. Fine-tune retrieval and generation components on domain-specific corpora.\n4. Evaluate performance on domain adaptation metrics, factual accuracy, and stakeholder usefulness.\n5. Conduct user studies with organizational decision-makers to assess impact.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Query about environmental compliance policies in manufacturing.\nExpected Output: Generation enriched with up-to-date, company-specific disclosure details and regulatory context, aiding managerial decisions.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If transfer learning does not yield domain gains, explore meta-learning approaches or prompt-engineered retrieval to better capture domain nuance."
