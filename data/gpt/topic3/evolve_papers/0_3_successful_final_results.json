        "title": "Neurocognitive-Inspired Reinforcement Learning Framework for Robust LLM Reasoning Evaluation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language models (LLMs) demonstrate instability in reasoning performance, where minor input perturbations disproportionately affect evaluated outcomes. This indicates a fundamental gap in evaluation methodologies that lack integration of neurocognitive-inspired mechanisms linking reasoning fidelity with decision-making processes. Consequently, existing benchmarks inadequately capture nuanced cognitive factors such as fatigue and bias, limiting reliability and interpretability of LLM reasoning assessments.",
        "Motivation": "To surpass competitive existing approaches, this research proposes a mechanistically grounded evaluation framework embedding explicit computational mappings of neurocognitive markers—such as cognitive fatigue and bias—into reinforcement learning (RL) driven reward structures guiding sequential reasoning tasks. By bridging principles from cognitive neuroscience and state-of-the-art RL techniques for generative AI, this approach offers a superior, fine-grained reliability metric reflecting dynamic reasoning capabilities beyond static accuracy scores. The integration of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for perturbation generation and variational autoencoders (VAEs) for latent cognitive state inference further enhances robustness and interpretability, representing a novel synthesis advancing AI capabilities evaluation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a structured evaluation protocol where LLMs engage in sequential multi-hop reasoning tasks embedded with decision points scored using RL reward functions explicitly shaped by computationally modeled neurocognitive signals. These signals—operationalizing fatigue and bias—are inferred via latent variable models (e.g., VAEs) trained on proxy cognitive data (e.g., error patterns, response times), and directly influence the reward shaping mechanism to penalize or reward reasoning paths reflecting cognitive states. Additionally, adversarial input perturbations are generated via GAN-based modules to systematically stress-test reasoning stability. This framework leverages actor-critic RL algorithms to optimize performance metrics incorporating (1) final answer accuracy, (2) intermediate reasoning trace coherence, and (3) cognitive state consistency scores. The method uniquely formalizes fatigue and bias as continuous latent variables integrated into reward shaping, enabling precise, mechanistic interpretation and benchmarking of LLM reasoning under neurocognitive constraints—advancing beyond prior work lacking such integrated, biologically-inspired RL reward architectures.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate multi-hop question-answering datasets and collect human behavioral analog datasets capturing cognitive fatigue and bias indicators (e.g., from psycholinguistic experiments). 2) Develop latent variable inference models (e.g., VAEs) to estimate neurocognitive markers from LLM intermediate outputs (error rates, hesitation proxies). 3) Design RL reward functions encompassing: (a) accuracy of final answers, (b) quality of intermediate reasoning steps measured via trace alignment, and (c) neurocognitive latent variables inducing dynamic reward shaping. 4) Implement GANs to generate targeted input perturbations simulating real-world deployment challenges. 5) Train and evaluate GPT-family models with actor-critic RL algorithms under the proposed reward regime. 6) Perform comparative analysis against baseline static psychometric metrics and analyze stability and reliability improvements under perturbations. 7) Correlate LLM reasoning fatigue/bias patterns with human experimental data to validate neurocognitive grounding.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A multi-hop question \"Who was the president of the US when the inventor of the telephone was born?\" The LLM proceeds through reasoning steps—identifying the inventor (Alexander Graham Bell), determining birth year (1847), and mapping to historical presidential terms—while latent cognitive states are inferred from response patterns. Reward feedback is computed by synthesizing answer correctness, intermediate reasoning justification coherence (aligned with gold reasoning chains), and fatigue/bias latent penalties shaping RL updates. Adversarial variants of the question (e.g., paraphrases or minor contradictory facts) test robustness of reasoning consistency and cognitive state dynamics.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the complexity of integrating neurocognitive latent variables into RL reward shaping introduces excessive variability or non-reproducibility, we will pivot to enhanced static evaluation metrics inspired by psychometric assessments. This includes measuring reasoning consistency through confidence calibration scores and error pattern analysis without explicit RL optimization, ensuring reliable interpretability remains achievable while setting groundwork for incremental integration of neurocognitive modeling in future work."

You should clarify the computational mapping of neurocognitive markers to RL reward shaping, intermediate reasoning trace evaluation, and how these relate to existing RL techniques applied to LLMs, to strengthen the mechanistic foundation and make the contribution clear and credible for the community.\"}, {"
