        "title": "Dynamic Semantic Prompt Adaptation for Subjective NLP Tasks in Software Engineering",
        "Problem_Statement": "Subjective NLP tasks like emotion recognition in software engineering outputs exhibit significant performance drops when LLMs are optimized for computational efficiency, leading to unreliable results. Achieving computational efficiency without sacrificing reliability in such subjective tasks remains a challenge.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal reliability gap of LLMs on complex and subjective tasks as identified in the critical gaps. This research introduces a dynamically adaptive prompt engineering framework tailored to semantic complexity and data representativeness, improving performance in low-resource, subjective NLP problems in software contexts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-layer adaptive prompt generation framework that analyzes input task complexity and semantic features in real-time to select and customize prompt patterns from an enriched catalog. The system incorporates imbalanced learning strategies to weight data samples dynamically and semantic augmentation tuned per instance. A feedback module estimates task difficulty to guide prompt adjustment iteratively, creating a 'smart prompt tuner' that balances efficiency and reliability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets on subjective NLP tasks in SE (e.g., emotion detection on commit messages). 2) Implement baseline LLM pipelines with static prompt patterns. 3) Develop the dynamic prompt adaptation module integrating semantic and complexity features. 4) Evaluate models with metrics like F1-score, accuracy, and computational resource usage. 5) Compare against baseline and analyze performance on balanced vs imbalanced subsets. 6) Conduct ablation studies on components of the adaptation process.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Fixes crashing issue when user inputs invalid credentials â€” really frustrated with the error handling here!\" Expected output: Emotion label \"Frustration\" with high confidence and reduced computation through targeted prompt augmentation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic adaptation fails to improve reliability, fallback to hybrid ensemble approaches combining static semantic prompt catalog patterns with post-hoc calibration using lightweight classifiers. Additionally, conduct qualitative error analysis to refine complexity metrics guiding prompt adaptation."

        "title": "Hybrid Symbolic-Neural LLM Pruning for Efficient Code Summarization",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLMs for code summarization expend unnecessary computational resources by processing irrelevant code pathways, reducing computational efficiency without significant gains in quality. There is a lack of methods integrating symbolic program analysis to prune these paths while maintaining summary accuracy.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the cross-disciplinary gap by integrating formal symbolic methods from model-driven engineering with neural LLM processing. This innovation aims to prune irrelevant pathways dynamically, improving computational efficiency and maintaining task-specific reliability in code summarization, as suggested in high-potential innovation opportunities.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a two-tier architecture where a symbolic static analyzer identifies functionally irrelevant code segments or paths based on control and data flow analysis. This symbolic pruning directs the neural LLM to ignore or minimally attend to these segments. The LLM is augmented with a gating mechanism conditioned on symbolic signals to selectively activate model pathways, greatly reducing computation while preserving summarization fidelity.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select code summarization datasets like CodeSearchNet. 2) Implement baseline LLM summarization models. 3) Build symbolic analyzers for control and data flow analysis on code snippets. 4) Design gating modules within the LLM conditioned on symbolic insights. 5) Evaluate summarization quality with BLEU and ROUGE metrics and measure compute savings. 6) Compare hybrid vs pure neural models on efficiency and reliability metrics.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A Python function with multiple conditional branches, some rarely executed paths. Expected output: A concise summary focusing on main functionality, omitting rarely taken branches, with at least 25% less computation compared to full model inference.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If symbolic pruning leads to quality degradation, fallback to soft attention masking allowing the LLM to re-incorporate potentially pruned code segments. Further, investigate reinforcement learning to balance pruning aggressiveness and output quality."

        "Problem_Statement": "Fully automated prompt design in LLMs fails to generalize robustly on imbalanced and evolving datasets common in software engineering NLP tasks, leading to reliability and efficiency trade-offs.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the external gaps by leveraging human-in-the-loop interactive learning paradigms to iteratively refine and optimize prompt designs, fostering both computational efficiency and trustworthiness. This approach taps into cognitive science frameworks to overcome fully automated pipeline limitations noted as a high-potential opportunity.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create an interactive platform where domain experts iteratively provide feedback on LLM outputs for representative samples, which is used to adapt prompts semantically. Employ active learning to identify ambiguous or error-prone instances and guide human annotation. Incorporate prompt update strategies that adjust semantic augmentations and catalog patterns dynamically based on feedback, optimizing for both accuracy and reduced compute demands.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Deploy on SE datasets with class imbalance (e.g., bug triaging). 2) Define initial prompt catalogs and baseline LLM outputs. 3) Engage human experts to assess output quality and provide real-time feedback. 4) Implement active learning to focus expert effort. 5) Iterate prompt refinements and evaluate improvements using accuracy, resource metrics, and human trust indices. 6) Compare fully automated vs human-in-the-loop results.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Bug report text with unclear severity classification. Initial output: \"Low priority\" but human feedback corrects to \"High priority\" prompting prompt adaptation. Expected output after refinement: Correct classification with reduced query complexity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should human-in-the-loop integration be resource-intensive, fallback to simulated expert feedback using annotated datasets or crowdsourcing. Additionally, explore semi-supervised prompt adaptation to reduce human load while maintaining gains."

        "Problem_Statement": "Current approaches focus on improving NLP tasks mainly within software engineering and neglect prompt design adaptability across diverse NLP domains, limiting computational efficiency-reliability trade-offs in unfamiliar tasks.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap regarding cross-task transferability by introducing a meta-learning framework to learn transferable prompt augmentation patterns that generalize across heterogeneous NLP domains, from software engineering to subjective tasks like emotion analysis, thereby improving efficiency and reliability.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a meta-prompt learning algorithm that treats prompt patterns as learnable parameters optimized for adaptability across multiple NLP tasks. The model trains on diverse datasets to extract universal semantic augmentation strategies. During deployment, the meta-learned prompt initializes task-specific tuning, requiring fewer examples and compute to maintain reliability across domains.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compile multi-domain NLP datasets spanning software engineering, sentiment analysis, and summarization. 2) Implement meta-learning framework on prompt catalogs. 3) Train meta-prompt parameters for cross-task generalization. 4) Evaluate on unseen domains using accuracy, efficiency, and sample efficiency metrics. 5) Compare against static domain-specific prompt designs.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A code snippet requiring quality annotation, an emotion-laden user review, a legal document clause summary. Expected output: High-quality task-specific outputs using minimal prompt tuning and reduced computational overhead.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If meta-learning fails in generalization, fallback to clustered domain adaptation techniques segmenting prompt catalogs by domain similarity. Also, investigate curriculum learning approaches to improve cross-domain transfer."

        "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap on low-resource robustness by systematically integrating imbalanced learning methods directly into the prompt catalog and semantic augmentation pipelines, creating better balanced and robust prompt strategies for few-shot learning with LLMs in software NLP.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Extend prompt catalogs with imbalance-aware augmentation techniques such as synthetic minority oversampling prompts, cost-sensitive semantic enrichments, and dynamic repetition weighting within few-shot settings. Embed a feedback control system monitoring class distributions to adjust prompt selection probabilities dynamically, aiming to improve output reliability under constrained computational budgets.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Use software engineering datasets with severe label imbalance. 2) Implement baseline few-shot prompting. 3) Design imbalance-aware prompt augmentations and control logic. 4) Evaluate with precision, recall, F-measure, and compute resource usage. 5) Conduct experiments varying imbalance ratios. 6) Benchmark against state-of-the-art few-shot learning techniques.",
