    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Design cognitive and psychological test suites relevant for language understanding; 2) Integrate with NLP benchmark task sets; 3) Evaluate LLMs across these joint tests; 4) Compare to human baselines; 5) Analyze correlations to identify behavioral alignment gaps; 6) Refine benchmarks iteratively.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "An LLM is tested for theory-of-mind reasoning and political bias across interconnected tasks, yielding comprehensive scores reflecting human-like cognition and ethical alignment.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If large-scale psychological testing proves resource-intensive, use simulated cognitive tests with synthetic human baselines and crowdsourced mini-experiments."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan suggests integrating cognitive and psychological tests with NLP benchmarks and comparing LLMs against human baselines. However, the plan lacks detailed clarification on how to effectively scale cognitive testing for LLMs, given the inherent complexities and resource intensiveness of psychological measurements. The brief fallback to simulated cognitive tests and crowdsourcing might not yield robust or representative human baselines. To be feasible, the plan needs clearer strategies for managing resource demands, ensuring statistical validity, and operationalizing composite scores in a reproducible manner, perhaps by piloting smaller focused studies before large-scale deployment, or leveraging existing cognitive datasets and human-in-the-loop evaluation frameworks rigorously adapted for LLM contexts. Without addressing these feasibility challenges concretely, the experiment plan risks being overly ambitious or impractical in real-world settings, which could stall progress or produce unreliable results. Thus, detailed feasibility considerations and validation protocols should be integrated upfront in the experimental design section to enhance robustness and operational viability of this promising interdisciplinary testing approach. Its current sketch is too high-level and optimistic for immediate implementation without clearer resource and methodological management vistas, which strongly warrants revision before proceeding to implementation stages. This critique primarily targets the Experiment_Plan section but impacts the entire research viability. \n\nSuggested focus: Develop detailed protocols for longitudinal cognitive validation, participant sampling, scaling strategies, and data integration pipelines explicitly stated in the plan for pragmatic feasibility assurance and trustworthy human-centered benchmarking outcomes.  This improvement will markedly strengthen the proposalâ€™s credibility and practical roadmap clarity.  \n\n---\n\n[SUGGESTION] Enhancing the feasibility with concrete pilot studies and resource plans should be prioritized immediately to avert scalability pitfalls and ensure experimental rigor in this pioneering framework proposal.\n\n---\n\n[FEA-EXPERIMENT] is crucial given the resource intensity of psychological testing embedded in LLM evaluation frameworks and composite metric derivation complexities, currently underdeveloped in the submission. Please address this as a priority before further development proceeds.\n\n--\n\nTarget Section: Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "While the proposal compellingly integrates cognitive psychology methods to evaluate LLMs, its novelty was rated merely competitive. To enhance both impact and novelty, I suggest explicitly incorporating concepts from 'human-in-the-loop' and 'intelligent tutoring systems' within the testing framework. For instance, integrating adaptive tutoring system paradigms could enable dynamic interaction between humans and LLMs during evaluations, allowing real-time calibration of tests to individual model responses and more nuanced measurement of human-like learning and reasoning traits. Additionally, leveraging 'technology acceptance model' concepts could help assess how human cognitive biases influence acceptance and trust in LLM outputs, enriching the psychological dimensions of evaluation beyond static tests. These globally linked concepts could transform the framework from a static testing platform to an interactive, context-aware evaluation ecosystem, increasing practical relevance and expanding impact across AI alignment, human-AI collaboration, and educational technology. Embedding these elements would concretely broaden the framework's scope and position it at the frontier of human-centered AI evaluation research. This suggestion mainly targets the Proposed_Method section but has positive ramifications throughout the proposal. Incorporating these perspectives is a high-leverage way to enhance novelty and impact given the already competitive saturation in AI psychological testing research.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
