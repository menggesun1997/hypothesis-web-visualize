    "title": "Embedding Value-Sensitive Design in LLM Bias Mitigation Taxonomies",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing bias mitigation taxonomies largely gloss over socio-technical values, power asymmetries, and ethical reflections within mitigation methods, limiting meaningful ethical integration in model fairness.",
    "Motivation": "This project targets the internal gap of limited emphasis on socio-technical values within ML fairness research by embedding value-sensitive design principles explicitly into bias mitigation taxonomies and processes, introducing ethical dimensions as core criteria.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct an enriched mitigation taxonomy incorporating value-sensitive design stages: stakeholder identification, value elicitation, ethical reflection checkpoints, power dynamics mapping. Develop operational protocols for integrating these into pre-, in-, intra-, post-processing bias interventions. Implement support tools that guide practitioners to assess systemic implications alongside traditional fairness metrics.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Select benchmark NLP tasks prone to social biases: sentiment analysis, toxicity detection. Compare standard mitigation pipelines vs. value-sensitive enhanced pipelines using augmented taxonomies. Measure fairness improvements, ethical audit scores via qualitative content analysis and downstream societal impact proxies from controlled simulations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Social media text with gendered language. Expected output: Model predictions balanced for gender groups with documented consideration of underlying power structures in mitigation report.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If formal methods fail to scale, develop semi-automated value elicitation tools leveraging crowdsourcing and expert panels to complement automated taxonomy deployment."

        "title": "Embedding Value-Sensitive Design in LLM Bias Mitigation Taxonomies Grounded in Responsible AI and Legal Frameworks",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing bias mitigation taxonomies for large language models (LLMs) often omit explicit incorporation of socio-technical values, power asymmetries, and enforceable ethical norms. This lack of integration with formal legal frameworks and participatory socio-technical processes limits the meaningful embedding of responsibility and fairness, especially within complex US civil rights contexts.",
        "Motivation": "While several bias mitigation schemes exist, they tend to focus narrowly on statistical fairness metrics, missing deeper socio-technical value alignments and legal enforceability. This results in limited impact on real-world fairness and ethical AI governance. Our approach aims to leap beyond incremental novelty by embedding value-sensitive design within bias mitigation taxonomies explicitly linked to Responsible Artificial Intelligence principles and US civil rights laws. This integration enhances ethical rigor, legal grounding, and multi-stakeholder legitimacy, addressing a crucial gap in bias mitigation research and practice for LLMs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose developing an enriched bias mitigation taxonomy that incorporates stages of value-sensitive design grounded in Responsible AI and legal frameworks, including: (1) Stakeholder and vulnerable group identification informed by structural inequalities analysis and civil rights statutes. (2) Elicitation of explicit ethical values anchored in both legal standards (e.g., US anti-discrimination laws) and ethical foundations via engaged human experts (e.g., ethicists, legal scholars, affected communities). (3) Embedding operational ethical reflection checkpoints that map power dynamics with participatory review panels. (4) Integration of federated data governance and federated learning techniques to safeguard privacy and democratize control over sensitive datasets during mitigation training. (5) Development of operational protocols that weave these elements into pre-, in-, and post-processing bias interventions, supplemented by transparent reporting aligned with Responsible AI governance frameworks. This socio-technical and legal hybrid structure surpasses existing taxonomies by systematically bridging ethical theory, law, and scalable ML practice.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select benchmark NLP tasks with documented social biases, such as sentiment analysis and toxicity detection using datasets like Jigsaw Toxicity and Social Bias Frames. 2. Assemble multi-disciplinary panels including AI ethicists, legal experts, sociologists specialized in structural inequalities, and affected community representatives to co-develop value-sensitive criteria aligned to US civil rights laws. 3. Develop and pilot semi-automated tools for ethical reflection checkpoints and power dynamics mapping, assessing their usability and scalability through controlled simulations and expert feedback loops. 4. Implement two parallel bias mitigation pipelines: (a) a baseline standard ML pipeline using established fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds) and (b) our enriched pipeline embedding the enhanced taxonomy, participatory protocols, and federated learning for data governance. 5. Evaluate outcomes quantitatively by extending fairness metrics with: (i) ethical audit scores operationalized through mixed-methodsâ€”including content analysis of mitigation reports, expert-rating scales on legal compliance and ethical depth, and quantitative proxy metrics of downstream societal impact such as bias persistence and error disparities across protected groups in simulation environments. 6. Complement quantitative assessment with qualitative interviews from panelists and practitioners to capture trustworthiness and transparency perceptions. 7. Conduct risk analysis and sensitivity studies to identify bottlenecks in embedding socio-technical values and test fallback semi-automated approaches involving crowdsourcing plus expert validation. This detailed, mixed-method plan ensures rigorous validation of the ethical and practical gains of our taxonomy.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Social media text containing gendered and racially coded language. Expected output: Model predictions balanced for gender and race groups with demonstrable reduction in biased misclassifications. Additionally, the mitigation report should explicitly document ethical reflection processes, stakeholder inputs, and power dynamics considerations aligned with civil rights legal standards. The transparency and participatory traceability of mitigation decisions should be verifiable, enhancing auditability and trust.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Recognizing challenges in scaling full socio-technical embeddings, we will develop a semi-automated value elicitation tool that combines crowdsourced inputs with curated expert panels. This hybrid approach aims to maintain ethical rigor while improving feasibility. We will pilot these tools in phased studies before committing to full-scale deployment. Additionally, we will explore modular implementation of the taxonomy components to allow adoption flexibility and facilitate integration with existing ML fairness pipelines under federated learning settings."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks sufficient detail to ensure scientific rigor and practical feasibility. For instance, the metrics and methodologies for measuring 'ethical audit scores' and 'downstream societal impact proxies' are not clearly defined, which risks ambiguity in evaluation outcomes. To strengthen feasibility, please specify concrete quantitative and qualitative measures, data collection protocols, and how controlled simulations will reliably model societal impacts. Clarifying these elements will help demonstrate that the evaluation can effectively validate the added value of value-sensitive design in bias mitigation taxonomies within tangible NLP tasks like sentiment analysis or toxicity detection, thus ensuring the experiment's success and reproducibility.\nAdditionally, the plan should consider potential challenges in operationalizing ethical reflection checkpoints and power dynamics mapping in automated or semi-automated settings, providing contingencies or pilot studies to assess these integrations before full-scale comparisons are conducted. This will enhance the project's risk management and feasibility outlook within the experimental framework since embedding socio-technical values often involves complex interdisciplinary expertise and subjective judgments that may not scale easily through standard ML pipelines or datasets alone.  \n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

Specifically, the proposal could incorporate formal legal and societal frameworks such as 'civil rights laws' and relevant 'US law' to ground value-sensitive design principles in enforceable ethical standards, enhancing the rigor and applicability of the developed mitigation taxonomy. \n\nFurthermore, linking the taxonomy and operational protocols with participatory methodologies involving 'human experts' and stakeholders from domains like 'structural inequalities' and 'ethical foundations' can increase transparency and trustworthiness. Embedding federated data governance approaches or engaging with 'federated learning' communities could also extend technical feasibility and broaden socio-technical integration. These steps would not only advance novelty beyond incremental combinations but also markedly lift the work's interdisciplinary resonance and practical relevance in AI fairness research and deployment contexts.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
