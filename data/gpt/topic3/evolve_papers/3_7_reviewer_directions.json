    "title": "Hybrid Human-AI Fairness Governance Framework for Sensitive NLP Pipelines",
    "Problem_Statement": "Automated fairness interventions often fail to capture context-specific socio-technical nuances, leading to suboptimal mitigation especially in regulated domains.",
    "Motivation": "By synthesizing gaps related to socio-technical value embedding and pipeline lifecycle comprehensiveness, this project proposes a human-in-the-loop governance approach co-designed with domain experts to complement automated fairness mechanisms.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Establish an interactive governance framework coupling automated bias detection and mitigation tools with human experts authorized to audit, interpret, and update fairness criteria. Incorporate ethical deliberation modules and traceability throughout pipeline stages, fostering continuous improvement.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Deploy in clinical NLP systems with expert panels. Compare system performance, fairness outcomes, and stakeholder trust versus fully automated pipelines. Employ qualitative and quantitative feedback instruments.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical prediction task with flagged demographic disparities. Expected output: Expert adjustments informed by model explanations augment fairness measures with documented governance actions.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If expert workload is prohibitive, develop AI-driven prioritization of cases requiring human review based on anomaly detection and impact estimations."

          "feedback_content": "The description of the Proposed_Method lacks sufficient detail about how the interactive governance framework concretely integrates automated bias detection tools with human expert interventions. Clarify the protocol for coordination: how are human decisions fused with automated outputs? How are conflicts or ambiguities resolved? Explicitly define the ethical deliberation modules' structure and the traceability mechanisms throughout the pipeline stages to ensure reproducibility and accountability. Providing a clearer operational flow and technical specifics would strengthen the soundness of the approach and alleviate doubts about implementation complexity and effectiveness in sensitive NLP pipelines, especially in clinical domains where stakes are high and decision transparency is critical. Consider including diagrams or examples to illustrate these mechanisms in detail in the full proposal section or supplementary materials if possible, enhancing reviewersâ€™ trust in the method's robustness and clarity of logic (Section: Proposed_Method)."

However, the plan requires more specifics on experimental design: How will fairness outcomes be quantitatively measured, and by what metrics? What qualitative feedback instruments will be employed, and how will stakeholder trust be reliably quantified? Additionally, consider potential challenges such as expert availability, workload, and bias in human evaluation. Address how to ensure reproducibility and control for confounding factors. Also, clarify the sample size, selection criteria for clinical systems and experts, and the duration of deployment to demonstrate feasibility. Strengthening these specifics will make the experimental plan scientifically sound and practical for real-world evaluation (Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)."
