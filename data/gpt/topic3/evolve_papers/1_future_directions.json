        "title": "Self-Supervised Domain Adaptation via Contrastive Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning",
        "Problem_Statement": "Domain-specific LLMs often produce hallucinated or inconsistent outputs, especially under limited annotated data and domain shifts. Existing adaptation methods marginally improve fluency but lack robustness and factual consistency in specialized settings.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the internal critical gap of LLM brittleness and hallucination in domain-specific adaptation, leveraging high-potential innovation opportunity 1 on self-supervised and continual learning to reduce annotation reliance and enhance robustness through hierarchical task decomposition.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a self-supervised hierarchical reinforcement learning framework where the LLM is decomposed into modular sub-policy networks responsible for content planning, factual verification, and language generation. Using contrastive learning objectives, the model learns to distinguish domain-relevant from irrelevant content without labeled data. Reinforcement rewards encourage factual consistency and penalize hallucinations by integrating an internal NLI-based fact checker as a learned critic. The hierarchy enables explicit planning and grounding at multiple discourse levels, enhancing interpretability and robustness to domain shifts.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement the hierarchical RL architecture atop a pretrained LLM (e.g., GPT). 2) Use self-supervised contrastive tasks on unannotated biomedical and clinical corpora for domain adaptation. 3) Benchmark against vanilla fine-tuning and modular planning baselines on domain-specific summarization tasks (e.g., clinical note summarization). 4) Evaluate factual consistency via SummaC and domain-adapted NLI metrics plus newly developed domain robustness scores. 5) Perform ablations isolating contrastive learning and hierarchy.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A clinical discharge summary draft. Output: A coherent, factually consistent summary that accurately reflects patient's condition and treatment plan without hallucinated or contradicting information, verified against the input with a fact-check score above threshold.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If hierarchical RL proves unstable, fallback to a two-stage approach with self-supervised contrastive domain adaptation followed by reinforcement fine-tuning using external fact-checking modules. Alternatively, explore curriculum learning with incremental complexity in domain tasks."

        "title": "Hybrid NLI and Noisy Channel Model for Domain-Adapted Factual Consistency Assessment",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing factual consistency models in domain-specific NLP largely rely on NLI or neural sequence modeling independently, failing to leverage the complementary strengths of probabilistic error modeling from noisy channel approaches. This limits robustness in detecting hallucinations in specialized domains.",
        "Motivation": "This idea targets the critical internal gap of model brittleness and the external gap of underexplored synergy between NLI and noisy channel models (high-potential innovation opportunity 2), proposing their principled integration to better model domain-specific inconsistency.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We design a hybrid framework combining an NLI-based entailment system with a probabilistic noisy channel model that explicitly models possible error transformations (e.g., paraphrasing, omission, hallucination). The noisy channel component estimates likelihoods of observed outputs under diverse error hypotheses conditioned on the input. NLI scores provide entailment judgments that modulate the noisy channel probabilities, producing a domain-adaptive factual consistency score that reflects both semantic entailment and error likelihood. The model is trained end-to-end on synthesized noisy examples generated from domain corpora to capture distributional shifts.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect domain-specific corpora from biomedical and clinical sources. 2) Generate synthetic noisy outputs simulating hallucination patterns. 3) Train the hybrid model and baselines (pure NLI and pure channel models). 4) Evaluate on human curated factual consistency datasets with domain-specific annotations. 5) Analyze robustness on out-of-distribution examples and domain shift scenarios.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Domain-specific claim and generated summary segment. Output: A grounded factual consistency score distinguishing subtle contradictions and hallucinations missed by standard NLI or channel-only methods.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If training end-to-end is challenging, implement modular post hoc fusion of NLI and channel scores via learned gating or calibration models. Explore alternate channel error models informed by domain ontologies."

        "title": "Cross-Modal Vision-Language Domain Grounding for Robust Clinical NLP",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLMs adapted for clinical NLP still suffer from hallucinations due to lack of richer semantic grounding, as these domain-specific applications often involve multimodal data (charts, images, reports) not fully leveraged in adaptation.",
        "Motivation": "We address the external gap of integrating cross-modal vision-language models and domain classifiers (high-potential innovation opportunity 3) to provide semantically richer, grounded representations that reduce hallucinations and improve robustness in clinical domain adaptations.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multimodal domain-adaptive LLM architecture integrating clinical document text, associated imaging (e.g., radiology scans), and structured domain classifiers. Using cross-modal transformers, we jointly embed textual and visual inputs with domain labels learned via contrastive domain classification objectives. This builds a unified semantic representation to condition generation modules. The approach includes domain-aware adapters that scale across downstream tasks and tasks multi-task learning to simultaneously optimize for summarization, diagnosis extraction, and error detection.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble a clinical multimodal dataset linking text notes with radiology images. 2) Pretrain cross-modal vision-language adapters with domain classification objectives. 3) Adapt a large language model to this enhanced representation for clinical summarization tasks. 4) Evaluate hallucination rates and task robustness compared with text-only baselines using clinical NLP benchmarks. 5) Conduct human-in-the-loop evaluation evaluating interpretability and factuality.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient clinical summary plus chest X-ray image. Output: A clinical note summary consistent with both text and image findings, avoiding hallucinated conditions not supported by either modality.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If visual grounding is not effective, incorporate alternative structured domain knowledge (e.g., ontologies, lab results) alongside domain classifiers for multi-task learning, or simplify modality fusion to late-stage feature concatenation."

        "title": "Continual Self-Supervised Domain Adaptation with Dynamic Memory Replay",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLM adaptation for domain-specific NLP faces continuous domain evolution and distribution shift, leading to degradation in performance and robustness without effective continual learning and adaptation.",
        "Motivation": "This project targets the external gap of continual learning and self-supervision (high-potential opportunity 1), aiming to develop a scalable domain-adaptive LLM framework that dynamically adapts to evolving domains while mitigating catastrophic forgetting in absence of large annotated corpora.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a continual learning framework utilizing dynamic memory replay buffers populated via self-supervised pseudo-labeling of new domain data streams. The model, based on a pretrained LLM, is fine-tuned continuously with regular sampling from memory to retain prior knowledge. Self-supervised objectives include masked domain-specific entity prediction and contrastive representation learning. Incorporating adaptive learning rate schedules and uncertainty-based sample selection, the method promotes robustness and balanced domain retention.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Prepare a simulated evolving domain dataset from biomedical news and publications. 2) Implement continual learning with dynamic memory and self-supervised objectives. 3) Compare with naive fine-tuning and static domain adaptation. 4) Evaluate task performance, especially robustness to domain shifts in clinical prediction tasks. 5) Analyze memory efficiency and forgetting metrics.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical NLP task input evolving over time. Output: Continuously updated model output maintaining high factual consistency and fluency without performance drop on past domain distributions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic memory replay causes inefficiency, experiment with regularization-based continual learning methods (e.g., elastic weight consolidation) and synthetic data augmentation for replay."

        "title": "Interactive Human-in-the-Loop Scalable Evaluation via Synthetic Domain-Aware Probing",
        "Problem_Statement": "Human evaluation for domain-specific adaptation of LLMs is costly and unscalable, limiting the ability to assess task performance robustness and factuality with high fidelity.",
        "Motivation": "We address the critical external gap of expensive and unscalable human evaluation by proposing a novel synthetic domain-aware probing paradigm that mimics human judgments at scale, reducing dependence on manual annotation and complementing imperfect automatic metrics.",
        "Proposed_Method": "The method automatically generates domain-aware synthetic test probes by perturbing real domain data with controlled factual errors, inconsistencies, and style variations using learned transformation models. A small seed of human annotations is used to train a meta-evaluator that predicts human-like quality and consistency scores on generated probes. This evaluator assists large-scale robust assessment of adapted LLM outputs via calibration and interactive refinement with human reviewers focusing only on ambiguous or high-uncertainty cases.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect domain-specific corpora and seed human evaluations on generated errors. 2) Train error generators and meta-evaluator models. 3) Evaluate meta-evaluator alignment with human judgments on held-out samples. 4) Deploy hybrid human–machine evaluation pipeline and benchmark against existing metrics. 5) Perform ablation on probe diversity and human workload reduction.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Summaries generated by adapted LLM with introduced factual errors versus gold references. Output: Predicted human-like scores accurately ranking summaries’ factuality and consistency aligning with real expert evaluations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If synthetic probing lacks realism, incorporate adversarial data generation or generative data augmentation informed by domain experts, or refine meta-evaluator with active learning from human feedback."
