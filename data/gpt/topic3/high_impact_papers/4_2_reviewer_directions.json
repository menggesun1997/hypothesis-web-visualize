    "title": "Hybrid Knowledge-Graph Enriched LLMs Integrating Biochemistry Domain Insights for Financial NLP Efficiency",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current foundational LLMs inadequately integrate domain knowledge from cross-disciplinary sources such as biochemistry, limiting their ability to generalize and maintain robustness under computational constraints in specialized NLP domains like finance.",
    "Motivation": "This idea responds to the lack of explicit bridge nodes between foundational LLM research and domain-specialized NLP applications by constructing hybrid LLM systems enriched with multi-disciplinary knowledge graphs from domains such as biochemistry, enhancing model robustness and efficiency.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a hybrid LLM architecture that fuses Transformer embeddings with node representations from a constructed multi-domain knowledge graph incorporating financial, biochemical, and Web of Science data. Using graph neural networks (GNNs) and attention mechanisms, the LLM dynamically retrieves and encodes relevant cross-domain context to regularize predictions, enabling reduced model size and computation without sacrificing reliability. The system selectively activates knowledge graph modules guided by a learned gating mechanism to optimize computational load.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build multi-domain knowledge graph combining biochemistry pathways, financial terminologies, and scholarly metadata.\n2) Fine-tune baseline LLMs with and without knowledge graph integration.\n3) Evaluate on financial NLP tasks: entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and forecasting.\n4) Measure computational cost reduction and robustness to domain shift.\n5) Conduct ablation to assess knowledge graph contribution.\n6) Visualization of gating mechanism activations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"The rising transcription factor levels signal a bullish market trend in biotech stocks.\"\nExpected output: Accurate sentiment classification that leverages biochemical domain knowledge cues while operating under constrained computational budgets.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If knowledge graph integration adversely affects inference speed, incorporate lightweight embedding distillation techniques or pruning. Alternatively, precompute knowledge-enhanced embeddings offline and use caching during inference."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that integrating biochemistry domain knowledge will enhance robustness and efficiency of financial NLP models is ambitious but currently insufficiently justified. The proposal needs to clarify and provide preliminary evidence or rationale on why biochemical knowledge graphs specifically provide complementary and relevant signals for financial NLP tasks, given the apparent domain semantic gap. A clearer articulation of the semantic relevance or analogy that justifies this cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer would strengthen the conceptual foundation and prevent risks of ineffective fusion or noise introduction during inference. This clarification is critical to establish the validity of the idea's foundational assumption before progressing to extensive experiments, as it impacts model soundness and applicability across domains rather than a coincidental theoretical novelty."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "While the experiment plan outlines sensible steps, it currently lacks detailed feasibility analysis regarding the construction and quality assurance of the proposed multi-domain knowledge graph combining biochemistry pathways, financial terminologies, and Web of Science data. This graph construction is a non-trivial task requiring data curation, entity alignment, and semantic harmonization across highly heterogeneous data sources. The proposal should provide concrete strategies or references for effective knowledge graph integration and scalability checks, as well as early evaluation metrics for graph quality. Additionally, the plan should address computational overhead measurement precisely, especially how gating mechanism activation will be quantitatively assessed and optimized during inference under constrained budgets. Comprehensive feasibility preparation here is essential to avoid costly reimplementation or dead-ends."
