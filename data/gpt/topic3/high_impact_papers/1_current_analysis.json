For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'The Content Analysis Guidebook', 'abstract': 'Content analysis is one of the most important but complex research methodologies in the social sciences.

With the technological development of deep learning-based high-precision recognition models and natural generation models, Metaverse is being strengthened with various factors, from mobile-based always-on access to connectivity with reality using virtual currency. The integration of enhanced social activities and neural-net methods requires a new definition of Metaverse suitable for the present, different from the previous Metaverse. This paper divides the concepts and essential techniques necessary for realizing the Metaverse into three components (i.e., hardware, software, and contents) and three approaches (i.e., user interaction, implementation, and application) rather than marketing or hardware approach to conduct a comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, we describe essential methods based on three components and techniques to Metaverse’s representative Ready Player One, Roblox, and Facebook research in the domain of films, games, and studies. Finally, we summarize the limitations and directions for implementing the immersive Metaverse as social influences, constraints, and open challenges.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Text Data Augmentation for Deep Learning', 'abstract': 'Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the most captivating applications of Deep Learning. In this survey, we consider how the Data Augmentation training strategy can aid in its development. We begin with the major motifs of Data Augmentation summarized into strengthening local decision boundaries, brute force training, causality and counterfactual examples, and the distinction between meaning and form. We follow these motifs with a concrete list of augmentation frameworks that have been developed for text data. Deep Learning generally struggles with the measurement of generalization and characterization of overfitting. We highlight studies that cover how augmentations can construct test sets for generalization. NLP is at an early stage in applying Data Augmentation compared to Computer Vision. We highlight the key differences and promising ideas that have yet to be tested in NLP. For the sake of practical implementation, we describe tools that facilitate Data Augmentation such as the use of consistency regularization, controllers, and offline and online augmentation pipelines, to preview a few. Finally, we discuss interesting topics around Data Augmentation in NLP such as task-specific augmentations, the use of prior knowledge in self-supervised learning versus Data Augmentation, intersections with transfer and multi-task learning, and ideas for AI-GAs (AI-Generating Algorithms). We hope this paper inspires further research interest in Text Data Augmentation.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Efficient Learning Machines, Theories, Concepts, and Applications for Engineers and System Designers', 'abstract': 'Machine learning techniques provide cost-effective alternatives to traditional methods for extracting underlying relationships between information and data and for predicting future events by processing existing information to train models. Efficient Learning Machines explores the major topics of machine learning, including knowledge discovery, classifications, genetic algorithms, neural networking, kernel methods, and biologically-inspired techniques. Mariette Awad and Rahul Khanna’s synthetic approach weaves together the theoretical exposition, design principles, and practical applications of efficient machine learning. Their experiential emphasis, expressed in their close analysis of sample algorithms throughout the book, aims to equip engineers, students of engineering, and system designers to design and create new and more efficient machine learning systems. Readers of Efficient Learning Machines will learn how to recognize and analyze the problems that machine learning technology can solve for them, how to implement and deploy standard solutions to sample problems, and how to design new systems and solutions. Advances in computing performance, storage, memory, unstructured information retrieval, and cloud computing have coevolved with a new generation of machine learning paradigms and big data analytics, which the authors present in the conceptual context of their traditional precursors. Awad and Khanna explore current developments in the deep learning techniques of deep neural networks, hierarchical temporal memory, and cortical algorithms. Nature suggests sophisticated learning techniques that deploy simple rules to generate highly intelligent and organized behaviors with adaptive, evolutionary, and distributed properties. The authors examine the most popular biologically-inspired algorithms, together with a sample application to distributed datacenter management. They also discuss machine learning techniques for addressing problems of multi-objective optimization in which solutions in real-world systems are constrained and evaluated based on how well they perform with respect to multiple objectives in aggregate.

Usually, it is essential to understand the reasoning behind an AI model’s decision-making. Thus, the need for eXplainable AI (XAI) methods for improving trust in AI models has arisen. XAI has become a popular research subject within the AI field in recent years. Existing survey papers have tackled the concepts of XAI, its general terms, and post-hoc explainability methods but there have not been any reviews that have looked at the assessment methods, available tools, XAI datasets, and other related aspects. Therefore, in this comprehensive study, we provide readers with an overview of the current research and trends in this rapidly emerging area with a case study example. The study starts by explaining the background of XAI, common definitions, and summarizing recently proposed techniques in XAI for supervised machine learning. The review divides XAI techniques into four axes using a hierarchical categorization system: (i) data explainability, (ii) model explainability, (iii) post-hoc explainability, and (iv) assessment of explanations. We also introduce available evaluation metrics as well as open-source packages and datasets with future research directions. Then, the significance of explainability in terms of legal demands, user viewpoints, and application orientation is outlined, termed as XAI concerns. This paper advocates for tailoring explanation content to specific user types. An examination of XAI techniques and evaluation was conducted by looking at 410 critical articles, published between January 2016 and October 2022, in reputed journals and using a wide range of research databases as a source of information. The article is aimed at XAI researchers who are interested in making their AI models more trustworthy, as well as towards researchers from other disciplines who are looking for effective XAI methods to complete tasks with confidence while communicating meaning from data.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Building Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models on Google Cloud Platform, A Comprehensive Guide for Beginners', 'abstract': 'Take a systematic approach to understanding the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning from the ground up and how they are applied in practice.

Because language data have a central role in all areas of psychology, this new technology has the potential to transform the field. In this Perspective, we review the foundations of LLMs. We then explain how the way that LLMs are constructed enables them to effectively generate human-like linguistic output without the ability to think or feel like a human. We argue that although LLMs have the potential to advance psychological measurement, experimentation and practice, they are not yet ready for many of the most transformative psychological applications — but further research and development may enable such use. Next, we examine four major concerns about the application of LLMs to psychology, and how each might be overcome. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for investments that could help to address these concerns: field-initiated ‘keystone’ datasets; increased standardization of performance benchmarks; and shared computing and analysis infrastructure to ensure that the future of LLM-powered research is equitable.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem tackled by this research cluster is the development and deployment of robust, explainable, and effective AI and machine learning models—especially large language models (LLMs)—for domain-specific natural language processing (NLP) applications with a focus on assessing task performance robustness. The core focus includes complex and practical research methodologies such as content analysis, algorithmic machine learning approaches, AI technology deployment, and the explainability of AI models (XAI). The thematic islands cluster around: (1) complex research methodologies and their processes, (2) algorithmic machine learning emergence and impact within AI technology, (3) explainable AI methodologies and their implementation, and (4) modernization and evaluation through user feedback. Dominant paradigms include application of explainability taxonomies in AI, data augmentation strategies in NLP to enhance model robustness, cloud-based scalable machine learning, and systematic content analysis as a methodological backbone for evaluating task performance and robustness. Explainability and trustworthy AI form the ethical and interpretability foundation supporting responsible AI deployment in domain-specific contexts.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps arise primarily around the challenge of bridging the explainability and robustness of AI models in domain-specific NLP scenarios. Though XAI methods exist, their integration with LLMs tailored for specific tasks remains underdeveloped, with limited assessment and benchmarking standards for performance robustness, interpretability, and trust from diverse user perspectives. Another internal gap is the methodological complexity in conducting systematic, standardized evaluations of LLM robustness and explainability across different domains, which the bridge node 'personal comments' hints at through user feedback and adaptation challenges. Externally, the global context highlights overlooked cross-disciplinary bridges, such as combining complex research methodology with algorithmic machine learning concepts applied in legal or medical domains (e.g., algorithmic discrimination, clinical risk assessment) to enhance robustness evaluation. Another novel connection is linking XAI and complex methodology with emerging cybersecurity and human-centered computing challenges (e.g., intrusion detection, black-box effects), showing potential to improve trust in NLP systems. Moreover, the modernization of AI through biomedical, clinical, and IoT environments suggests unexploited opportunities to adapt domain-specific robustness testing methods from these areas to NLP, particularly in deploying explainable, secure, and privacy-preserving models.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate advanced algorithmic machine learning evaluation techniques from clinical AI (Global Concept) with explainability frameworks in XAI (Local Thematic Island) to build standardized, domain-specific robustness benchmarks for LLMs in NLP tasks. This addresses the internal gap of lacking standardized performance and explainability evaluation, as highlighted in foundational XAI surveys (paper 8) and local complex methodology needs.\n\nOpportunity 2: Leverage interdisciplinary methodologies combining complex research methodologies with cybersecurity-focused explainability approaches (e.g., intrusion detection systems, black-box effect mitigation) to enhance the trustworthiness and robustness of LLMs in sensitive NLP applications such as legal or medical text analysis. This synthesizes the 'complex research methodology' and 'field of XAI' bridge (Global Context) with the core focus on responsible AI deployment (papers 1 and 8).\n\nOpportunity 3: Apply modernization insights from biomedical and IoT domains—especially privacy-preserving and human-computer collaboration paradigms—to develop adaptive data augmentation and domain-tailored LLM fine-tuning pipelines. This theme bridges 'algorithmic machine learning' and 'modernization' with textual data augmentation methods (paper 6) to improve robustness and practical applicability in domain-specific NLP contexts, filling gaps noted in early-stage NLP data augmentation and LLM deployment practices (paper 10)."
