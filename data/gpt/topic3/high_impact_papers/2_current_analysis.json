The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'GPT-4 Technical Report', 'abstract': \"We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can\\naccept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than\\nhumans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on\\nvarious professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar\\nexam with a score around the top 10% of test takers.

However, there are few human studies on the usability of these tools and how they fit the programming workflow. In this work, we conducted a within-subjects user study with 24 participants to understand how programmers use and perceive Copilot, a LLM-based code generation tool. We found that, while Copilot did not necessarily improve the task completion time or success rate, most participants preferred to use Copilot in daily programming tasks, since Copilot often provided a useful starting point and saved the effort of searching online. However, participants did face difficulties in understanding, editing, and debugging code snippets generated by Copilot, which significantly hindered their task-solving effectiveness. Finally, we highlighted several promising directions for improving the design of Copilot based on our observations and participants’ feedback.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Generative AI in Medicine and Healthcare: Promises, Opportunities and Challenges', 'abstract': 'Generative AI (artificial intelligence) refers to algorithms and models, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, that can be prompted to generate various types of content. In this narrative review, we present a selection of representative examples of generative AI applications in medicine and healthcare. We then briefly discuss some associated issues, such as trust, veracity, clinical safety and reliability, privacy, copyrights, ownership, and opportunities, e.g., AI-driven conversational user interfaces for friendlier human-computer interaction. We conclude that generative AI will play an increasingly important role in medicine and healthcare as it further evolves and gets better tailored to the unique settings and requirements of the medical domain and as the laws, policies and regulatory frameworks surrounding its use start taking shape.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence', 'abstract': 'Abstract The book has two goals. The first goal is meta-theoretical and is fulfilled by Part One: an interpretation of the past (Chapter 1), the present (Chapter 2), and the future of AI (Chapter 3). Part One develops the thesis that AI is an unprecedented divorce between agency and intelligence. On this basis, Part Two investigates the consequences of such a divorce, developing the thesis that AI as a new form of agency can be harnessed ethically and unethically. Chapter 4 offers a unified perspective on the many principles that have been proposed to frame the ethics of AI. Chapter 5 discusses the potential risks that may undermine the application of these principles, and then Chapter 6 analyses the relation between ethical principles and legal norms, and offers a definition of soft ethics as post-compliance ethics. Chapters 7–9 analyse the ethical challenges caused by the development and use of AI, evil uses of AI, and good practices when applying AI. The last group of chapters focuses on AI for social good or AI4SG (Chapter 10), the positive and negative impacts of AI on the environment (Chapter 11), and the possibility of using AI in support of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (Chapter 12).The book concludes (Chapter 13) by arguing in favour of a new marriage between the Green of all our habitats and the Blue of all our digital technologies and how this new marriage can support and develop a better society and a healthier biosphere.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'AMA Manual of Style', 'abstract': 'Abstract The AMA Manual of Style, 11th edition, is a must-have guide for those seeking to publish research findings and anyone involved in medical, health, or scientific writing and publishing.

It also provides recommendations on how to navigate the dilemmas that authors, researchers and their institutions, medical editors and publishers, writers, and members of the news media who cover scientific research confront on a daily basis. Written by an expert committee of JAMA Network editors, this 11th edition thoroughly covers ethical and legal issues, authorship, conflicts of interest, scientific misconduct, and intellectual property, in addition to preparation of articles for publication, style, terminology, measurement, and quantification.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Artificial intelligence in clinical medicine: catalyzing a sustainable global healthcare paradigm', 'abstract': 'As the demand for quality healthcare increases, healthcare systems worldwide are grappling with time constraints and excessive workloads, which can compromise the quality of patient care. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in clinical medicine, revolutionizing various aspects of patient care and medical research. The integration of AI in clinical medicine has not only improved diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes, but also contributed to more efficient healthcare delivery, reduced costs, and facilitated better patient experiences. This review article provides an extensive overview of AI applications in history taking, clinical examination, imaging, therapeutics, prognosis and research. Furthermore, it highlights the critical role AI has played in transforming healthcare in developing nations.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Lawyering in the Age of Artificial Intelligence', 'abstract': 'We conduct the first randomized controlled trial of AI assistance’s effect on human legal analysis. We randomly assigned sixty students at the University of Minnesota Law School each to complete four separate legal tasks (drafting a complaint, a contract, a section of an employee handbook, and a client memo), either with or without the assistance of GPT-4, after receiving training on how to use GPT-4 effectively. We then blind-graded the results and tracked how long the students took on each task. We found that access to GPT-4 slightly and inconsistently improved the quality of participants’ legal analysis but induced large and consistent increases in speed. The benefits of AI assistance were not evenly distributed: in the tasks on which AI was the most useful, it was significantly more useful to lower-skilled participants. On the other hand, AI assistance reduced the amount of time that participants took to complete the tasks roughly uniformly regardless of their baseline speed. In follow up surveys, we found that participants reported increased satisfaction from using AI to complete legal tasks and that they correctly predicted the tasks for which GPT-4 would be most helpful. These results—which will likely serve as a lower-bound estimate on AI’s capacity to improve the efficiency of legal services—have important normative implications across the future of lawyering. For law schools, they suggest the importance of deliberately and holistically assessing when and how law students are trained to use AI. For lawyers and judges, they suggest that the time to embrace AI is now, though the contours of what that will mean can and should vary significantly by practice area, task, and the stakes of the underlying matters. And for purchasers of legal services, our results suggest that it is time to reconsider what types of legal matters should be sent to outside counsel rather than handled in-house, and how matters that are handled externally are managed and billed.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'A Comprehensive Study of ChatGPT: Advancements, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations in Natural Language Processing and Cybersecurity', 'abstract': 'This paper presents an in-depth study of ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model that is revolutionizing generative text.
