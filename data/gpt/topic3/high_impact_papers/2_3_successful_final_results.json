        "title": "Cross-Domain Ethical Metric Transfer from Biomedical to Legal NLP Benchmarking with Explainable AI and Human-in-the-Loop Validation",
        "Problem_Statement": "While biomedical NLP ethical metrics have matured focusing on patient privacy and safety, direct application to legal NLP neglects critical domain-specific ethical nuances such as legal confidentiality, interpretive risks, and compliance with normative legal standards. The biomedical and legal domains differ substantially in data types, ethical priorities, and regulatory frameworks, undermining naive transferability. Therefore, a grounded theoretical and empirical framework is essential to rigorously identify overlapping and divergent ethical principles, enabling principled adaptation of biomedical ethical evaluation metrics to legal NLP. This approach must incorporate explainability and human-centered validation to ensure meaningful ethical assessment rather than simplistic reweighting.",
        "Motivation": "Existing ethical evaluation benchmarks primarily target biomedical NLP, with limited exploration of their adaptability to legal NLP, where ethical risks are equally impactful but differently manifested. This gap limits the development of standardized cross-domain ethical metrics and hinders consistent evaluations across domains. Our work advances novelty by proposing a knowledge-graph-enhanced framework integrating domain-specific ethical ontologies from both biomedical and legal fields, combined with explainable AI techniques and few-shot learning to adapt pretrained language models ethically. Leveraging human-in-the-loop protocols and rigorous empirical validation, we aim to pioneer a robust, interpretable, and transferable ethical metric framework that navigates complex normative divergences while fostering alignment with socially critical legal NLP tasks such as contract summarization and compliance checking.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We will first construct a comprehensive bilingual ethical knowledge graph synthesizing ethical principles, constraints, and normative criteria from biomedical and legal literature and standards, supported by scholarly grounding and expert input. Using this graph, we will map overlaps and divergences via ontology alignment and thematic clustering to clarify transferability boundaries. We will design an explainable AI evaluation framework that integrates these semantic insights with pretrained, retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs), enhanced by few-shot learning (FSL) approaches to induce domain-specific ethical reasoning without exhaustive re-training. Ethical metrics will be instantiated as composite scores incorporating confidentiality preservation, interpretive fidelity, and normative compliance, validated through a human-in-the-loop multi-stage evaluation involving domain experts and manual annotation protocols. Multi-task learning will be operationalized by joint training on curated biomedical and legal NLP datasets, leveraging augmented ethical labels derived from the knowledge graph and pilot feedback to tune metric weights. This comprehensive approach explicitly clarifies and justifies metric transferability, ensures explainability, and systematically evaluates ethical compliance in challenging real-world legal NLP scenarios.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Literature survey and formal construction of biomedical and legal ethical ontologies; 2) Development and alignment of a cross-domain ethical knowledge graph incorporating domain experts from biomedical ethics, legal ethics, and NLP; 3) Dataset curation involving public biomedical NLP benchmarks and new legal NLP datasets (e.g., contract summarization, compliance check corpora) annotated via expert consensus guidelines for ethical attributes; 4) Implementation of retrieval-augmented pretrained LLMs fine-tuned with few-shot learning to capture domain-specific ethical nuances guided by the knowledge graph; 5) Quantitative evaluation using task accuracy metrics (e.g., macro F1-score) alongside newly developed explainable ethical compliance scores; 6) Qualitative human-in-the-loop validation with domain experts conducting manual evaluations assessing confidentiality, interpretive correctness, and compliance risks; 7) Iterative refinement of metrics and model training informed by pilot results, ablation studies, and error analysis; 8) Comparative benchmarking against domain-specific ethical rule-based baselines and non-adapted biomedical metrics to demonstrate empirical effectiveness and transferability benefits.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Evaluate and summarize legal risks in the new contract clause while ensuring confidentiality and interpretive accuracy.\" Expected Output: Text summary omitting sensitive client information, presenting risks without misleading or oversimplifying interpretations, with an ethical compliance score supported by explanation components highlighting detected privacy preservation and risk assessment fidelity. Additional test cases involve assessing compliance in identifying misleading contract statements and preserving privileged communication references ethically.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If transfer via knowledge graph and few-shot methods shows limited practicality, fallback includes development of lightweight modular ethical metrics combining core universal ethical principles (e.g., confidentiality, harm avoidance) with domain-specific rule sets encoded explicitly for legal NLP tasks. We will also explore expanding human-in-the-loop feedback cycles to refine these metrics iteratively. Alternatively, focusing on holistic explanation-driven evaluation frameworks for legal NLP without direct metric transfer, utilizing explainability as the central ethical evaluation scaffold, will be pursued to maintain impact while mitigating transfer assumptions risk."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that ethical evaluation metrics from biomedical NLP can be effectively adapted and transferred to the legal domain via domain adaptation and multi-task learning. However, biomedical and legal domains differ greatly in data types, ethical concerns (e.g., patient privacy vs. legal confidentiality and interpretation risks), and normative constraints. This substantial divergence may invalidate the core assumption that a generalized ethical metric can be meaningfully constructed via reweighting biomedical constraints alone. It is essential to empirically justify or theoretically outline why biomedical ethical criteria are adaptable to legal tasks beyond expert consultation, and to clarify differences and commonalities in ethical concerns between these domains to strengthen the soundness of the assumption in the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections. Otherwise, the foundation of the approach risks being too fragile or oversimplified, compromising the study's validity and impact potential. Recommendations: provide a more rigorous domain ethics comparison and justify transferability assumptions explicitly with scholarly grounding or preliminary validation evidence in the revised manuscript and methodology description (e.g., in Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines logical stages, yet the plan lacks detail on critical feasibility factors: the availability and construction method of multi-domain datasets combining biomedical and legal ethical constraints, the criteria and process of expert consultations, and the validation strategy for ethical compliance in legal NLP tasks. Particularly, ethical compliance assessment is inherently complex and subjective; how will it be measured quantitatively or qualitatively? The plan also omits how retrieval-augmented large language models will be adapted or fine-tuned with these ethical metrics, and how domain adaptation or multi-task learning will be concretely operationalized and evaluated. Without these clarifications, the proposed experiments risk being impractical or insufficiently rigorous to validate the method's effectiveness. Recommendations: enhance the Experiment_Plan section with concrete descriptions of dataset design, ethical compliance evaluation protocols (including human-in-the-loop evaluation if applicable), model adaptation strategies, and clear metrics for both ethical and task performance. Adding pilot experiment results or feasibility analyses would further strengthen this section."
