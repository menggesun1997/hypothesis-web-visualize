    "title": "Dynamic Ethical Metric Evolution for Continuously Deployed Retrieval LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Static ethical evaluation frameworks cannot adapt to evolving societal norms and new ethical challenges arising in real-world deployment of retrieval-augmented LLMs.",
    "Motivation": "Extends Opportunity 1 by enabling continuous update mechanisms for ethical metrics, embedding a dynamic ethical evaluation responsive to societal changes discovered via academic and industrial feedback loops.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a meta-learning system that monitors deployment data, flags emerging ethical issues, and suggests updates to evaluation benchmarks and training objectives. Includes active crowdsourcing interface and automated drift detection on ethical metric components.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Deploy retrieval-augmented LLMs with ethical logging modules; 2) Collect real-time data with potential ethical violations; 3) Develop drift detection algorithms for ethical metric components; 4) Use human-in-the-loop active learning to refine metrics; 5) Evaluate improvements over time.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Generate text on a new controversial medical procedure.\" Output adapts over time to new ethical concerns identified by society, preserving ethical alignment dynamically.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time evolution is complex, implement periodic scheduled updates leveraging expert reviews and major dataset revisions."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a meta-learning system that monitors deployment data, flags ethical issues, and suggests updates to benchmarks and training objectives. However, the mechanism by which ethical drift is detected and how updates are integrated into the evaluation framework and training loop lacks sufficient detail. Clarify how the drift detection algorithms work technically, how new ethical norms are validated before incorporation, and how the system balances responsiveness with stability to avoid oscillations or overfitting to transient ethical trends. Providing concrete algorithmic or architectural details would strengthen the soundness of the proposal, ensuring the method is well-reasoned and implementable at scale and in real time. Without this, the approach risks being overly conceptual and difficult to evaluate or reproduce practically, impacting overall credibility and robustness of the solution's design and effectiveness assessment. This is critical for legitimacy in continuous ethical metric evolution scenarios, where trustworthiness and transparency are paramount to adoption and impact."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating, consider integrating concepts from management scholars on business practices and technology acceptance models to enhance adoption and impact. Specifically, incorporating human-in-the-loop frameworks not only for metric refinement but also for ethical governance and stakeholder engagement can position the system as a socio-technical solution. This integration could extend beyond technical metric updates to embedding organizational learning and compliance mechanisms within deployment environments, particularly in high-stakes domains like electronic health records or counseling services, where evolving ethical norms critically influence decision-making. Framing the research to address challenges recognized by interdisciplinary experts and linking it with intelligent decision-making practices can not only differentiate the work from existing approaches but also broaden its relevance and facilitate real-world uptake."
