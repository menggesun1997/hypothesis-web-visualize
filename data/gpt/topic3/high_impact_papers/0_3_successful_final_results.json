    "title": "Cross-Domain Content Analysis Guided XAI for Trustworthy LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM explainability methods lack adaptability across domains like healthcare, law, and finance, failing to incorporate domain-specific user needs and contextual content characteristics in explanations, which limits trust and responsible deployment.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap on domain adaptation lack and taps into the hidden bridge between complex research methodologies and XAI. The proposal aims to synthesize cross-domain content analysis from social sciences with explainability techniques to produce trust-enhancing, context-aware explanations.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a dynamic explanation generation architecture that uses domain-specific content analysis ontologies and discourse models to guide XAI output. The system uses a modular content parser informed by social science taxonomies to interpret task inputs and outputs, adapting explanation styles and depths according to domain conventions and end-user profiles (e.g., clinicians vs. legal scholars). The explanation generation is conditioned on detected discourse structures and pragmatic cues extracted in real-time.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multi-domain datasets with expert-annotated discourse structures.\n2) Fine-tune transformer-based LLMs with integrated discourse parsing modules.\n3) Develop domain ontologies capturing explanation preferences and styles.\n4) Implement explanation modules conditioned on domain content features.\n5) Evaluate with expert user studies assessing perceived trust and understanding.\n6) Benchmark against generic XAI methods for explanation relevance and accuracy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Legal document review task. Output: Explanation highlighting argument structure, citation relevance, and interpretative legal norms tailored to a lawyer's expectations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time discourse parsing is too slow or unreliable, fallback on offline pre-processing or rule-based heuristics for content adaptation. Alternatively, prototype initially on a single domain to refine approaches before cross-domain generalization."

        "title": "Cross-Domain Content Analysis Guided XAI for Trustworthy LLMs with Responsible AI and User-Interaction Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM explainability methods remain inadequately adaptive across critical domains such as healthcare, law, and finance, often neglecting domain-specific user needs, discourse characteristics, and contextual content variation. This shortfall impedes user trust and responsible deployment in high-stakes environments, where domain-tailored, interactive, and cognitively aligned explanations are essential for safety and accountability.",
        "Motivation": "While prior explainability techniques achieve superficial transparency, they largely overlook the integration of domain-specific discourse structures, user interaction dynamics, and Responsible AI principles necessary for trustworthy deployment. Our proposal innovates by synthesizing cross-domain content analysis, social science discourse taxonomies, and adaptive explanation generation within a rigorously defined architecture. We further incorporate real-time user interaction data such as eye-tracking to dynamically refine explanations. This fusion advances beyond competitive methods by operationalizing human-centered, context-adaptive, and responsible explanations that align with domain conventions and user cognitive states, enabling interpretable AI systems in sensitive real-world domains like health systems and legal practice.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular, end-to-end system combining multi-source inputs to produce dynamic, domain-adaptive explanations with the following key architecture components:\n\n1. **Discourse Parsing Module:** A pre-processing pipeline applies domain-specific discourse parsers based on social science taxonomies to input texts, extracting rhetorical and pragmatic structures (e.g., argument components, legal norms, clinical findings). These are encoded as structured features.\n\n2. **Ontological Explanation Conditioning:** Dedicated domain ontologies encapsulating explanation preferences, narrative styles, and user profile requirements (clinicians, lawyers) guide explanation style and content. Ontologies interface via knowledge graphs accessible to the generation module.\n\n3. **Transformer-based Explanation Generator with Fusion Layers:** A transformer LLM augmented with specialized fusion layers integrates discourse features, ontological knowledge embeddings, and real-time user interaction signals (e.g., eye gaze fixation and saccades) captured via multi-sensor fusion frameworks. Fusion layers modulate attention and explanation content dynamically.\n\n4. **User Interaction Feedback Loop:** Eye-tracking and interaction metrics feed back to the explanation generator to iteratively refine explanation granularity and saliency, forming an intelligent tutoring system tailored to the user's cognitive load and attentional state.\n\n5. **Processing Pipeline and Data Flow:** Inputs first undergo discourse parsing and ontology mapping; the resulting feature set and user interaction data are fused into the LLM's internal representations during explanation generation. Outputs adapt in style, depth, and content structure based on real-time contextual and user cues.\n\nThe architectural design is illustrated via component interaction diagrams specifying data flow and API interfaces to ensure reproducibility and extensibility. This systematic integration is novel in combining social science discourse models, ontologies, transformer architectures, and multi-sensor user data to realize truly responsible and trustworthy AI explanations across domains.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) **Dataset Collection & Annotation:** Collaborate with domain experts to curate multi-domain corpora (healthcare notes, legal texts, financial reports) and develop comprehensive annotation guidelines for discourse structures customized per domain. Employ semi-automated annotation tools and inter-annotator agreement measures to ensure consistency and scalability.\n\n2) **Discourse Parsing Module Development:** Train and validate domain-specific parsers leveraging transfer learning and weak supervision to manage annotation costs and improve parsing accuracy.\n\n3) **Ontology Construction:** Build formal explanation ontologies via expert workshops mapping user preferences, styles, and domain conventions.\n\n4) **Model Implementation and Optimization:** Integrate discourse features, ontologies, and multi-sensor user interaction data into transformer architectures with fusion modules. Employ model compression and distillation techniques to mitigate computational overhead and optimize inference speed.\n\n5) **Intelligent Tutoring System Prototype:** Develop interactive explanation interfaces with eye-tracking sensors to collect gaze data and adapt explanation content in real-time.\n\n6) **User Studies:** Conduct rigorously controlled studies with target users (e.g., clinicians, legal professionals), employing within-subject designs comparing our adaptive explanations against strong baselines. Metrics include trust questionnaires, task performance, comprehension scores, cognitive load assessments, and eye-tracking metrics to quantify explanation effectiveness.\n\n7) **Benchmarking:** Evaluate explanation relevance, fidelity, and trustworthiness against generic XAI techniques across domains using standard and newly devised metrics tailored for explainability.\n\nThis plan addresses feasibility challenges by leveraging semi-automated annotation, computational optimizations, and rigorous experimental designs to validate both technical and human-centered claims.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A legal contract review task involving multi-party liability clauses.\nOutput: An explanation that dynamically highlights the argumentation structure using discourse annotations, references pertinent legal precedents with citation relevance scored via ontological mappings, and adapts explanation complexity and examples based on eye-gaze feedback from the reviewing lawyer, who prefers succinct summaries with detailed justifications available on demand.\n\nInput: Clinical diagnostic report analysis.\nOutput: An explanation emphasizing symptom-diagnosis causal chains informed by clinical ontologies, structured per typical medical report discourse, and adjusted interactively based on clinicianâ€™s gaze patterns and response times, supporting an intelligent tutoring interface.\n\nThese exemplars demonstrate cross-domain adaptability, discourse- and ontology-informed explanations, and cognitive-aware user adaptation enabled by multi-sensor fusion.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time discourse parsing proves computationally prohibitive, we will implement efficient, incremental parsing with lightweight features combined with pre-indexed domain ontologies for rapid retrieval.\n\nShould multi-sensor integration with eye-tracking face practical constraints (hardware availability, user acceptance), fallback strategies include simulated user attention models derived from interaction logs and keyboard/mouse behaviors.\n\nIn case annotation efforts in multiple domains exceed resource bounds, begin with a focused pilot study in a single high-impact domain (e.g., healthcare), refining annotation schemes and modeling. Subsequently, we will progressively generalize methods to other domains employing transfer learning.\n\nModel optimization strategies such as knowledge distillation, pruning, and quantization will be implemented to maintain inference speed without sacrificing explanation quality.\n\nThese fallbacks ensure stepwise risk mitigation and robust progress toward cross-domain, responsible, and user-adaptive explainability."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an ambitious dynamic explanation generation architecture that adapts across domains using ontologies, discourse models, and pragmatic cues. However, the mechanism for integrating real-time discourse parsing with explanation generation lacks clarity on specific model architectures, data flow, and how social science taxonomies concretely influence the LLM's outputs. Clarify and strengthen the method section by detailing how discourse structures and pragmatic cues are operationalized and how modular components interact to produce domain-adaptive explanations. This will enhance the soundness and reproducibility of the approach, reducing risks in implementation complexity and ensuring the method is conceptually grounded with a clear processing pipeline. For example, specify whether discourse parsing is done as a preprocessing step feeding features into the LLM, or if the LLM internally models discourse dynamically, and how the ontologies guide explanation formulation pragmatically for different user profiles (e.g., clinician vs. legal scholar). Provide sample model architecture diagrams or algorithmic sketches if possible to remove ambiguity and strengthen this important core assumption about the system's mechanism. This clarity is essential since the claimed novelty and impact rest on this cross-disciplinary synthesis and adaptive explanation capability which is conceptually complex and technically challenging to realize satisfactorily without clear mechanism elaboration on the social science + LLM integration layer and explanation conditionality logic inherent in the system design. Without this, risks persist that the method is underspecified and challenging to faithfully implement or evaluate on realistic inputs, limiting the work's internal validity and eventual trustworthiness claims.  \n\n"

However, three key feasibility challenges need addressing explicitly. First, collecting expert-annotated discourse structures across diverse domains (healthcare, law, finance) is a labor-intensive and costly step that may require domain-specific annotation guidelines and substantial expert involvementâ€”please discuss how scaling and annotation consistency will be ensured. Second, integrating discourse parsing modules into transformer LLMs can be computationally demanding and may degrade inference speed; outline computational feasibility, model optimization plans, and fallback strategies besides offline or heuristic parsing noted in fallback plans. Third, the user studies assessing perceived trust and understanding are critical for impact validation but require careful design to isolate the effect of the proposed adaptive explanations versus baselines; provide more concrete evaluation criteria, proposed user numbers, study design outline, and metrics to ensure scientific rigor and replicability. Addressing these practical challenges thoroughly will enhance the experiment plan's robustness, reduce risk, and ensure that the projectâ€™s ambitious cross-domain applicability and user-centered trust claims are realistically validatable within a typical project's time and resource constraints."

For example, extend your test cases or evaluation to include intelligent tutoring systems for clinicians or legal professionals, potentially coupling your discourse-aware explanations with eye-tracking data or gaze data to measure and optimize explanation effectiveness and user attention, leveraging multi-sensor fusion techniques. This fusion could differentiate your work from existing competitive approaches by grounding explanations not only in domain ontologies and discourse but also in real-time user interaction signals, pushing toward more trustworthy, human-centered AGI-aligned systems.
