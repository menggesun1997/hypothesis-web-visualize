    "title": "Cross-Domain Content Analysis Guided XAI for Trustworthy LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM explainability methods lack adaptability across domains like healthcare, law, and finance, failing to incorporate domain-specific user needs and contextual content characteristics in explanations, which limits trust and responsible deployment.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap on domain adaptation lack and taps into the hidden bridge between complex research methodologies and XAI. The proposal aims to synthesize cross-domain content analysis from social sciences with explainability techniques to produce trust-enhancing, context-aware explanations.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a dynamic explanation generation architecture that uses domain-specific content analysis ontologies and discourse models to guide XAI output. The system uses a modular content parser informed by social science taxonomies to interpret task inputs and outputs, adapting explanation styles and depths according to domain conventions and end-user profiles (e.g., clinicians vs. legal scholars). The explanation generation is conditioned on detected discourse structures and pragmatic cues extracted in real-time.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multi-domain datasets with expert-annotated discourse structures.\n2) Fine-tune transformer-based LLMs with integrated discourse parsing modules.\n3) Develop domain ontologies capturing explanation preferences and styles.\n4) Implement explanation modules conditioned on domain content features.\n5) Evaluate with expert user studies assessing perceived trust and understanding.\n6) Benchmark against generic XAI methods for explanation relevance and accuracy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Legal document review task. Output: Explanation highlighting argument structure, citation relevance, and interpretative legal norms tailored to a lawyer's expectations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time discourse parsing is too slow or unreliable, fallback on offline pre-processing or rule-based heuristics for content adaptation. Alternatively, prototype initially on a single domain to refine approaches before cross-domain generalization."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an ambitious dynamic explanation generation architecture that adapts across domains using ontologies, discourse models, and pragmatic cues. However, the mechanism for integrating real-time discourse parsing with explanation generation lacks clarity on specific model architectures, data flow, and how social science taxonomies concretely influence the LLM's outputs. Clarify and strengthen the method section by detailing how discourse structures and pragmatic cues are operationalized and how modular components interact to produce domain-adaptive explanations. This will enhance the soundness and reproducibility of the approach, reducing risks in implementation complexity and ensuring the method is conceptually grounded with a clear processing pipeline. For example, specify whether discourse parsing is done as a preprocessing step feeding features into the LLM, or if the LLM internally models discourse dynamically, and how the ontologies guide explanation formulation pragmatically for different user profiles (e.g., clinician vs. legal scholar). Provide sample model architecture diagrams or algorithmic sketches if possible to remove ambiguity and strengthen this important core assumption about the system's mechanism. This clarity is essential since the claimed novelty and impact rest on this cross-disciplinary synthesis and adaptive explanation capability which is conceptually complex and technically challenging to realize satisfactorily without clear mechanism elaboration on the social science + LLM integration layer and explanation conditionality logic inherent in the system design. Without this, risks persist that the method is underspecified and challenging to faithfully implement or evaluate on realistic inputs, limiting the work's internal validity and eventual trustworthiness claims.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan proposes a strong and logical sequence from multi-domain data collection through fine-tuning to user studies and benchmarking. However, three key feasibility challenges need addressing explicitly. First, collecting expert-annotated discourse structures across diverse domains (healthcare, law, finance) is a labor-intensive and costly step that may require domain-specific annotation guidelines and substantial expert involvement—please discuss how scaling and annotation consistency will be ensured. Second, integrating discourse parsing modules into transformer LLMs can be computationally demanding and may degrade inference speed; outline computational feasibility, model optimization plans, and fallback strategies besides offline or heuristic parsing noted in fallback plans. Third, the user studies assessing perceived trust and understanding are critical for impact validation but require careful design to isolate the effect of the proposed adaptive explanations versus baselines; provide more concrete evaluation criteria, proposed user numbers, study design outline, and metrics to ensure scientific rigor and replicability. Addressing these practical challenges thoroughly will enhance the experiment plan's robustness, reduce risk, and ensure that the project’s ambitious cross-domain applicability and user-centered trust claims are realistically validatable within a typical project's time and resource constraints."

          "feedback_content": "To enhance the impact and novelty, consider integrating 'Responsible Artificial Intelligence' and 'health system' concepts explicitly by demonstrating how your adaptive XAI explanations can support responsible deployment in critical real-world settings such as healthcare. For example, extend your test cases or evaluation to include intelligent tutoring systems for clinicians or legal professionals, potentially coupling your discourse-aware explanations with eye-tracking data or gaze data to measure and optimize explanation effectiveness and user attention, leveraging multi-sensor fusion techniques. This fusion could differentiate your work from existing competitive approaches by grounding explanations not only in domain ontologies and discourse but also in real-time user interaction signals, pushing toward more trustworthy, human-centered AGI-aligned systems. This would concretely operationalize trust and responsibility claims and align with growing community and industry priorities around Responsible AI and interpretable, context-adaptive interfaces for high-stakes AI systems."
