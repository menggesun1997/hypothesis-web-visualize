For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'The Content Analysis Guidebook', 'abstract': 'Content analysis is one of the most important but complex research methodologies in the social sciences.

Here we examine breakthroughs over the past decade that include self-supervised learning, which allows models to be trained on vast amounts of unlabelled data, and geometric deep learning, which leverages knowledge about the structure of scientific data to enhance model accuracy and efficiency. Generative AI methods can create designs, such as small-molecule drugs and proteins, by analysing diverse data modalities, including images and sequences. We discuss how these methods can help scientists throughout the scientific process and the central issues that remain despite such advances. Both developers and users of AI tools need a better understanding of when such approaches need improvement, and challenges posed by poor data quality and stewardship remain. These issues cut across scientific disciplines and require developing foundational algorithmic approaches that can contribute to scientific understanding or acquire it autonomously, making them critical areas of focus for AI innovation.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Efficient Learning Machines, Theories, Concepts, and Applications for Engineers and System Designers', 'abstract': 'Machine learning techniques provide cost-effective alternatives to traditional methods for extracting underlying relationships between information and data and for predicting future events by processing existing information to train models. Efficient Learning Machines explores the major topics of machine learning, including knowledge discovery, classifications, genetic algorithms, neural networking, kernel methods, and biologically-inspired techniques. Mariette Awad and Rahul Khanna’s synthetic approach weaves together the theoretical exposition, design principles, and practical applications of efficient machine learning. Their experiential emphasis, expressed in their close analysis of sample algorithms throughout the book, aims to equip engineers, students of engineering, and system designers to design and create new and more efficient machine learning systems. Readers of Efficient Learning Machines will learn how to recognize and analyze the problems that machine learning technology can solve for them, how to implement and deploy standard solutions to sample problems, and how to design new systems and solutions. Advances in computing performance, storage, memory, unstructured information retrieval, and cloud computing have coevolved with a new generation of machine learning paradigms and big data analytics, which the authors present in the conceptual context of their traditional precursors. Awad and Khanna explore current developments in the deep learning techniques of deep neural networks, hierarchical temporal memory, and cortical algorithms. Nature suggests sophisticated learning techniques that deploy simple rules to generate highly intelligent and organized behaviors with adaptive, evolutionary, and distributed properties. The authors examine the most popular biologically-inspired algorithms, together with a sample application to distributed datacenter management. They also discuss machine learning techniques for addressing problems of multi-objective optimization in which solutions in real-world systems are constrained and evaluated based on how well they perform with respect to multiple objectives in aggregate.

Usually, it is essential to understand the reasoning behind an AI model’s decision-making. Thus, the need for eXplainable AI (XAI) methods for improving trust in AI models has arisen. XAI has become a popular research subject within the AI field in recent years. Existing survey papers have tackled the concepts of XAI, its general terms, and post-hoc explainability methods but there have not been any reviews that have looked at the assessment methods, available tools, XAI datasets, and other related aspects. Therefore, in this comprehensive study, we provide readers with an overview of the current research and trends in this rapidly emerging area with a case study example. The study starts by explaining the background of XAI, common definitions, and summarizing recently proposed techniques in XAI for supervised machine learning. The review divides XAI techniques into four axes using a hierarchical categorization system: (i) data explainability, (ii) model explainability, (iii) post-hoc explainability, and (iv) assessment of explanations. We also introduce available evaluation metrics as well as open-source packages and datasets with future research directions. Then, the significance of explainability in terms of legal demands, user viewpoints, and application orientation is outlined, termed as XAI concerns. This paper advocates for tailoring explanation content to specific user types. An examination of XAI techniques and evaluation was conducted by looking at 410 critical articles, published between January 2016 and October 2022, in reputed journals and using a wide range of research databases as a source of information. The article is aimed at XAI researchers who are interested in making their AI models more trustworthy, as well as towards researchers from other disciplines who are looking for effective XAI methods to complete tasks with confidence while communicating meaning from data.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Opportunities and obstacles for deep learning in biology and medicine', 'abstract': \"Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.\"}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Recommender Systems Handbook', 'abstract': 'The explosive growth of e-commerce and online environments has made the issue of information search and selection increasingly serious; users are overloaded by options to consider and they may not have the time or knowledge to personally evaluate these options.

    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem addressed by this research cluster is assessing and improving the reliability and trustworthiness of AI models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), when performing benchmark NLP tasks. The core focus, as evidenced by the central nodes, revolves around rigorous content analysis and complex research methodologies applied to AI technologies exhibiting human-level performance on academic benchmarks. The two main thematic islands encapsulate: (1) complex research methodology including content analysis and practical research advice, and (2) the algorithmic and technological emergence of AI delivering text inputs and outputs at near or above human-level standards. A third smaller cluster centers on eXplainable AI (XAI) and model implementation challenges. Dominant methods include transformer-based large-scale models (e.g., GPT-4), detailed taxonomies and classifications from XAI to address model interpretability, and methodological rigor in evaluating model behavior across benchmarks. This interdisciplinary cluster leverages theoretical foundations in machine learning, application-driven benchmarks, and explainability paradigms to foster responsible AI deployment.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite strong progress, foundational papers highlight significant challenges in interpretability and trust of LLM outputs—the ‘black-box’ effect remains a core limitation. Bridge nodes such as 'human-level performance' indicate the seductive appeal of benchmarking but also underline that passing benchmarks does not guarantee reliable, trustworthy or legally/commercially deployable AI systems. There is a lack of standardized, rigorous evaluation frameworks that integrate explainability assessments with performance reliability. Furthermore, the domain-specific adaptation of benchmarks and methods (e.g., health, legal domains) remains underexplored or rudimentary. External/Novel Gaps: The GPS analysis uncovers overlooked interdisciplinarity between complex research methods and algorithmic machine learning, especially in leveraging advanced content analysis techniques from social sciences to decode AI decision processes. Notably, the linkage between 'complex research methodology' and 'field of XAI' suggests opportunity in integrating user-centered, domain-tailored evaluation frameworks tailored to stakeholder needs (e.g., legal interpretability, medical diagnostics). Another gap is applying methodologies like natural language processing and explainability in hybrid systems that blend human and AI decision-making for critical domains. These cross-disciplinary linkages promise to enrich both model evaluation rigor and responsible deployment practices.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate advanced content analysis methodologies from social sciences (highlighted in the GPS link between 'complex research methodology' and 'field of XAI') with XAI model evaluation techniques to develop domain-adaptive, user-centric explanation frameworks. This would address the internal gap of insufficient interpretability evaluation by combining rigorous qualitative and quantitative analyses to improve trust and transparency in LLM benchmark results.\n\nOpportunity 2: Leverage the hidden bridge between 'algorithmic machine learning' and 'text output' with robust, explainability-driven ML approaches (from the thematic islands) to establish composite metrics that assess not only accuracy but also reasoning reliability and factual consistency in LLM-generated text. This would help overcome the limitation of current benchmark reliance on surface-level performance metrics.\n\nOpportunity 3: Apply interdisciplinary research bridging 'complex research methodology' and 'algorithmic machine learning' concepts to co-design evaluation protocols incorporating legal, ethical, and domain-specific constraints (as indicated by GPS links with legal studies and healthcare). This would facilitate responsible deployment of LLMs by embedding accountability and compliance checks into performance benchmarking, thus addressing the challenge of trustworthiness and real-world applicability beyond standard academic benchmarks."
