    "title": "Hybrid Ontology-Guided Retrieval for Ethical Clinical NLP Generation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Multimodal integration and accurate ethical guidance in clinical NLP remain limited due to unstructured retrieval and generation pipelines lacking domain ontological constraints.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gaps in multimodal integration and ethical evaluation by embedding biomedical ontologies directly into retrieval-augmented generation workflows, enabling semantically-aware ethically-aligned outputs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a hybrid retrieval system that combines semantic indexation guided by biomedical ontologies and neural retrievers, constraining generation to ontology-validated concepts, with ethical rule enforcement layered on top.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop biomedical ontology-enhanced indices; 2) Fine-tune LLMs constrained by ontology mappings; 3) Integrate ethical rules from clinical guidelines; 4) Evaluate on clinical NLP benchmarks with ethical annotations; 5) Compare rule-abiding and unconstrained generation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Generate a patient medication plan.\" Output: \"Based on clinical ontology and ethical guidelines, recommended dosage is...\" ensuring semantic validity and ethical compliance.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If ontology-based constraints reduce fluency, relax constraints progressively or incorporate them as soft prompts rather than hard filters."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a hybrid retrieval combining ontology-guided semantic indices and neural retrievers, along with generation constrained to ontology-validated concepts and ethical rules. However, the mechanism lacks clarity on how these components interact in detail, especially how the ethical rules are technically integrated and enforced during generation. More explicit description is needed on the retrieval-to-generation pipeline, the interface between the ontology constraints and the LLM fine-tuning or decoding process, and how multimodal signals (alluded to in motivation) are incorporated, ensuring the approach is coherent and technically feasible rather than a high-level concept. This clarity is critical given the complexity of clinical NLP generation with ethical constraints to establish soundness of approach and avoid oversimplification of integration challenges. Consider adding a detailed system architecture or workflow diagram and clarify where neural vs. symbolic components dominate or cooperate in the pipeline to strengthen soundness and implementability assessment in Proposed_Method sections."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is broadly outlined but lacks detail on key practical considerations. For example, how will biomedical ontologies be selected and processed for semantic index construction, and how feasible is fine-tuning LLMs to be constrained by ontology mappings in terms of required data and computational resources? Integration of ethical rules from clinical guidelines is a complex task requiring precise operationalizationâ€”details on rule formalization, conflict resolution, and enforcement mechanisms are missing. Moreover, evaluation metrics and datasets referenced as clinical NLP benchmarks with ethical annotations should be specified to ensure the plan's viability and replicability. The fallback plan is reasonable but should specify metrics or criteria that trigger constraints relaxation. Overall, strengthening the experiment plan with precise milestones, resource estimates, and concrete evaluation strategies is vital to verifying feasibility and to convincing reviewers of practical success likelihood."
