    "title": "Sociolinguistic-Informed Explainability Framework for Domain-Specific LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a persistent lack of interpretability and trust in LLMs when deployed in domain-specific contexts such as legal and healthcare, due to the black-box nature and insufficient evaluation frameworks that fail to incorporate user-centered sociolinguistic factors.",
    "Motivation": "This idea directly tackles the internal gap of interpretability and the external gap identified by the hidden bridge between complex research methodologies (social science content analysis) and XAI for domain adaptation. It leverages social science methods to tailor explanations that are meaningful to stakeholders, addressing the lack of standardized, user-centric, domain-adaptive evaluation frameworks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid evaluation framework that integrates advanced sociolinguistic content analysis techniques (e.g., speech act theory, conversational implicature) with state-of-the-art XAI methods such as counterfactual explanations and saliency maps, tailored specifically for legal and medical LLM applications. This framework will model explanation preferences of domain experts through iterative human-in-the-loop refinement, combining qualitative coding of explanation outputs with quantitative evaluation metrics. The framework will be modular, allowing substituting or extending sociolinguistic analyses depending on the domain.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset: Curate domain-specific corpora (e.g., legal contracts, medical consultation transcripts) and fine-tune GPT-4 or similar LLMs.\n2) Collect explanation preference data from domain experts via surveys and think-aloud protocols.\n3) Implement and integrate social science content analysis tools for interpretability assessment.\n4) Develop metrics combining qualitative sociolinguistic codes with quantitative trust and interpretability scores.\n5) Benchmark against existing XAI frameworks on domain-specific tasks including question answering and summarization.\n6) Conduct user studies to evaluate explanation usefulness and trust enhancement.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Summarize the legal obligations stated in this contract clause.\" Expected Output: A structured summary highlighting key obligations alongside an explanation referencing specific linguistic cues and legal terms that justify the summary, with a sociolinguistic annotation indicating modality and prescriptive nature of statements.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If integrating sociolinguistic content analysis proves too complex or inconsistent, fallback to creating a semi-automated pipeline combining standard XAI tools and rule-based domain ontologies for interpretability. Alternatively, increase human-in-the-loop correction cycles or focus exclusively on one domain initially for depth over breadth."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is ambitious and multifaceted but lacks detailed operationalization, particularly concerning the integration of sociolinguistic content analysis with quantitative evaluation metrics. Clarify how qualitative sociolinguistic coding will be reliably quantified and combined into trust scores to ensure reproducibility and scalability. Specify methodologies for iterative human-in-the-loop refinement to manage subjectivity and inter-annotator variability. Also, address data privacy and ethical considerations in using sensitive legal and medical text data. Strengthening these points will improve the scientific rigor and practical feasibility of the experiment plan, essential for successful real-world deployment and evaluation within resource and timeline constraints of top-tier research projects, especially at the intersection of social sciences and NLP/XAI frameworks. This is the critical bottleneck for validating the framework's soundness and practical impact in domain-specific applications without incurring prohibitive overhead or inconsistency in interpretation quality assessment frameworks.\n\nSuggestion: Include pilot studies or phased validation steps explicitly to isolate and refine the novel integration aspects before full-scale benchmarking and user studies, enhancing confidence in feasibility and trustworthiness of the framework's outputs and interpretations prior to wide user adoption or deployment in sensitive domains like law and medicine.\n\n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict of NOV-COMPETITIVE, the idea should better leverage synergies with broader impactful AI concepts to increase its competitiveness and influence. I recommend explicitly integrating principles from 'human-centered artificial intelligence' and 'knowledge-intensive tasks' to elevate user-centricity and domain expertise incorporation in the explanation framework. For example, embedding process discovery techniques to dynamically uncover domain-specific reasoning paths within LLM outputs can interface effectively with sociolinguistic analyses, enhancing explanation transparency along with the cognitive workflows of domain experts. Moreover, linking to core NLP tasks and intelligent systems advances the scalability and adaptability of the framework by incorporating robust NLP pipelines and explainability toolkits that generalize beyond just legal and medical text domains. Embedding this multi-disciplinary integration explicitly in the methodology and experiment plan will widen the potential impact horizon, avoid too narrow domain confinement, and position the work at the convergence of social science-informed XAI, core AI advances, and real-world knowledge-intensive applications, thereby addressing concerns about novelty and impact saturation in this competitive area.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
