        "title": "Modular Multi-Agent Privacy-Preserving Knowledge Retrieval with Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Filters and Federated Learning",
        "Problem_Statement": "Integrating retrieval augmentation in large language models (LLMs) exposes risks of unintentional leakage of sensitive information from proprietary and heterogeneous databases during generation, challenging privacy compliance and trustworthiness in enterprise and healthcare domains.",
        "Motivation": "While prior methods apply static privacy filters, there remains a critical gap in dynamic, adaptive privacy protection mechanisms that balance data utility and privacy across diverse sensitive domains. By leveraging a modular multi-agent neuro-fuzzy system specialized for distinct privacy categories alongside federated continual learning, this work pioneers a scalable, context-aware architecture. It bridges enterprise knowledge management and computational intelligence to enable robust, adaptive privacy-preserving augmentation for LLM retrieval pipelines—offering superior novelty and real-world applicability at the ethics-IT frontier.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-agent architecture composed of specialized adaptive neuro-fuzzy filter agents, each trained to protect different sensitive data domains (e.g., personal identifiers, corporate secrets, medical records). Retrieval outputs first route through a context-sharing module that dynamically assesses content domain and routes documents to relevant agents. Each agent employs a detailed neuro-fuzzy inference system: inputs include semantic and syntactic features extracted from retrieved text (e.g., named entities, domain-specific keywords, metadata attributes). Fuzzy rules encoded by domain experts and learned via neuro-adaptive techniques evaluate privacy sensitivity scores per data field. Decision criteria mask or alter sensitive fields based on thresholded privacy risks while striving to preserve informational utility. The agents collectively adapt continuously through federated and continual learning mechanisms—updating rule weights without sharing raw data—to maintain robust filtering aligned with evolving enterprise or healthcare contexts. To illustrate, a system flow diagram and pseudocode showcase how retrieval outputs pass through sequential agent filtering, with iterative privacy-utility tradeoff optimization at inference time. This design leverages computational intelligence in a modular, extensible framework that integrates seamlessly with existing LLM retrieval pipelines.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect and annotate multi-domain enterprise and healthcare datasets with fine-grained privacy-sensitive labels; 2) Design, encode, and validate domain-specific fuzzy rules with expert input; 3) Train individual neuro-fuzzy filter agents with adaptive rule weight updates using annotated data; 4) Develop and test the multi-agent context-sharing router module; 5) Integrate federated continual learning protocols enabling decentralized model updates without raw data exchange; 6) Conduct end-to-end evaluation on privacy leakage benchmarks and downstream LLM task accuracy across heterogeneous retrieval scenarios; 7) Perform ablation studies assessing modular agent contributions and federated learning benefits; 8) Iterate privacy sensitivity thresholds and fusion strategies for optimal utility-privacy balance.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Retrieve employee contact and project details related to project X for report generation.\" Output: The system routes query results through corporate secrets and personal data filter agents. Names and contact info are selectively redacted or pseudonymized, while project-specific technical information remains intact to preserve report utility, ensuring compliance with enterprise privacy policies.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive filter integration yields unacceptable retrieval degradation, fallback involves applying post-generation privacy auditing tools combined with differential privacy noise injection to outputs. Alternative strategies include reducing agent specialization granularity or enhancing rule expressiveness through hybrid neuro-symbolic techniques to regain balance."

Elaborate on the architecture and decision criteria of the neuro-fuzzy filter, including specifics on feature representation, rule formulation, and how continuous adaptation is ensured during inference to maintain retrieval relevance while enforcing privacy constraints robustly. Clarifying this will help validate the method's soundness and reproducibility, making it more convincing for reviewers and practitioners alike as a privacy-preserving augmentation to LLM retrieval pipelines. Suggest adding a detailed technical design subsection with pseudo-code or system flow diagrams in the next iteration of the proposal to enhance clarity and feasibility assessment."

This modular context sharing could improve dynamic privacy risk assessment across heterogeneous databases, thereby elevating novelty and practical impact. Also, exploring synergy with 'machine learning' techniques like continual or federated learning can enable filter adaptation over time without centralized data exposure, boosting scalability and trustworthiness. This integration would position the approach closer to cutting-edge privacy-preserving knowledge systems in real-world enterprise or healthcare contexts, as hinted by linked concepts, and enhance the work's competitiveness and relevance at the ethics-IT frontier."
