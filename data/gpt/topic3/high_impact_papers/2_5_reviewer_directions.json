    "title": "Interpretable Ethical Explanation Generator for Retrieval-Augmented LLM Outputs",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of interpretability and user understanding in the ethical decisions or factuality validation made by retrieval-augmented generative models.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gaps in interpretability and the bridge gap linking ethics scholarship with technical advances, by creating a transparent explanation layer that justifies both retrieval and generation choices ethically and factually.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an explanation generation module that provides natural language rationales aligned with ethical and factual evaluation scores for each generated output segment, leveraging attention maps, provenance from retrieved documents, and ethical evaluation outcomes.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Integrate explanation generation with retrieval-augmented pipeline; 2) Collect human evaluation data on explanation quality and helpfulness; 3) Employ proxy metrics like faithfulness and plausibility; 4) Compare output with and without explanation module in user studies for trust and usability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Generate a medical recommendation for patient symptoms.\" Output: \"Based on retrieved NIH guidelines and ethical considerations on privacy, the recommendation is... Explanation: The model cites guideline X, avoids unverified sources, and respects data confidentiality.\"",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If explanation generation is not sufficiently faithful, test simpler schematic overlays such as source highlighting or confidence score visualizations."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an explanation generation module linking ethical and factual evaluation scores to output segments via attention maps and provenance, but lacks sufficient detail on how these disparate signals will be effectively integrated and weighted to produce coherent, user-understandable explanations. Clarify the mechanism by which ethical considerations, factuality scores, and attention provenance are combined to generate explanations, and how the system resolves conflicting signals to maintain explanation faithfulness and transparency. Providing a diagram or formal model would strengthen the soundness here, enabling clearer understanding and reproducibility of the method design at this competitive research frontier. Without this, the approach risks being underspecified or overly optimistic in feasibility and interpretability assumptions, considering the inherent challenges in trustworthy explanation generation for neural retrieval-augmented models in high-stakes domains like medical recommendations or ethics-sensitive applications. This clarification is essential before extensive experiments are conducted or impact claims made, ensuring groundwork is solid and the module's interpretability claims are credible and testable in practice. This addresses soundness of the core mechanism, a foundational step for this important work's success and validity in the field. Targeting Proposed_Method section for refinement here is critical to move beyond a high-level concept to an actionable design that the community can evaluate and build upon robustly. "

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and the rich set of Globally-Linked Concepts, a key way to enhance the idea's impact and novelty is to ground the explanation generator concretely in a high-stakes real-world domain such as clinical decision support systems or forensic psychiatry. For example, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) and state-of-the-art representation learning (e.g., gated recurrent units or graph-neural-network-based models) could provide domain-specific provenance and ethical constraints tightly integrated with retrieval and generation. This domain focus would offer concrete evaluation benchmarks and user trust metrics not broadly available for generic retrieval-augmented LLM explanations, thus increasing both empirical rigor and societal impact. Consider extending the experiment plan to incorporate real-world datasets and stakeholder user studies from Intensive Care Unit or forensic psychiatric report scenarios, thereby bridging technical novelty with meaningful application. This domain integration will help differentiate the work substantially from existing explanation techniques, meeting both technical and ethical interpretability demands uniquely and raising the work’s profile at premier conference venues with multidisciplinary relevance. The Innovator should explicitly pursue such enriched global integration as a next critical step post preliminary design refinement for maximal contribution and uptake in the field."
