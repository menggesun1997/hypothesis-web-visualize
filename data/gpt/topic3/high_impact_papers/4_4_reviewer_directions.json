    "title": "Markovian Arrival Process Guided Attention Mechanism for Sequence Fidelity in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current attention mechanisms in LLMs do not explicitly model the stochastic temporal dependencies and arrival dynamics in input sequences, limiting their ability to maintain sequence fidelity under computational efficiency constraints.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the external novel gap, this proposal integrates Markovian arrival processes (MAPs) modeling from biomedical sequencing into Transformer attention to better capture timing and reliability in sequence modeling, offering a fundamentally new probabilistic approach.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Incorporate a MAP-guided attention mechanism that parameterizes attention weights as stochastic arrival rates modulated by Markovian states encoding context-dependent sequence dynamics. This probabilistic attentional layer replaces fixed-point attention scoring with a dynamic process controlling focus distribution according to modeled arrival likelihoods, enabling efficient pruning of low-frequency dependencies during inference for computational savings.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Formalize MAP-based attention layer and implement as PyTorch module.\n2) Train standard LLM architectures augmented with MAP attention on NLP benchmarks emphasizing sequence fidelity.\n3) Compare performance and efficiency against conventional self-attention.\n4) Evaluate noise robustness and ability to maintain sequence order information.\n5) Analyze distribution of learned arrival process states.\n6) Extend to domain-specific datasets (e.g., financial sequence prediction).",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Time-series financial news headlines with varying temporal dependencies.\nExpected output: Accurate next-step prediction and classification with fewer computations by ignoring low-probability attention arrivals, maintaining sequence fidelity.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If training instability arises, hybridize MAP attention with conventional self-attention in an ensemble or implement warm-start training from pretrained conventional attention models. Alternatively, explore simpler semi-Markov approximations."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed MAP-guided attention mechanism is conceptually promising, but the description lacks clarity on how Markovian arrival rates quantitatively integrate with the existing attention scoring framework in Transformers. Specifically, the mathematical formulation of the stochastic arrival rates modulating attention weights and the inference-time pruning strategy need concrete elaboration to assess soundness. Clarify how the transition probabilities and states from the MAP are learned and updated within backpropagation, and how these probabilistic parameters interplay with usual attention score normalization and masking conventions. This clarification is essential for reproducibility and assessing the core innovation's validity and applicability across different LLM architectures and sequence types, especially given the complexity of integrating a stochastic temporal process into standard attention   mechanisms. Provide a detailed algorithmic or pseudocode description to strengthen this section's rigor and enable peer reviewers to fully grasp the methodological novelty and its implications on sequence fidelity and computational efficiency trade-offs.  This should address the critical gap in understanding the actual mechanism's function and feasibility at an implementation and optimization level.  (Target section: Proposed_Method)  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The outlined experiment plan is comprehensive but ambitious, especially regarding the integration of MAP into large pretrained LLMs and domain-specific fine-tuning in step 6. There is no mention of baseline controlling for additional parameter and computational overhead introduced by the MAP layer, which is vital for a fair comparison. Consider adding ablation studies to isolate the impact of MAP attention on noise robustness and sequence fidelity. Moreover, the fallback plan is sound but would benefit from more detailed contingency procedures, such as criteria for transitioning to hybrid models or semi-Markov approximations based on specific training metrics (e.g., convergence stability, validation loss). Also, clarify expected computational resource needs and training duration estimates to verify feasibility. Providing prototype experiments or synthetic dataset benchmarks prior to full LLM-scale training would increase confidence in practical deployment. Strengthen feasibility by discussing optimization challenges or anticipated bottlenecks in PyTorch implementation, especially regarding gradient backpropagation through stochastic MAP states.
