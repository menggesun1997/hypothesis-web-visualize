        "title": "Interpretable Ethical Explanation Generator for Retrieval-Augmented LLMs in Clinical Decision Support",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs) applied in high-stakes domains such as clinical decision support lack transparent, interpretable explanations for their ethical and factual outputs, limiting user trust and practical adoption in sensitive medical environments.",
        "Motivation": "While retrieval-augmented LLMs show promise for generating informed recommendations, existing approaches inadequately integrate ethical reasoning and factuality verification in explainable ways, especially in critical healthcare contexts. By grounding explanation generation within the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) clinical decision support domain and leveraging domain-specific data such as electronic health records (EHRs), this work aims to uniquely bridge representation learning, ethical constraints, and provenance tracing. This tight domain integration addresses the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty challenge by providing concrete, multidisciplinary impact through interpretable, ethically-aware, and factually-grounded explanation mechanisms tailored to real-world clinical workflows.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular explanation generation framework that synthesizes ethical evaluation scores, factuality verification, and provenance signals from retrieval components using a formal multi-source integration mechanism. Specifically:\n\n1. **Domain-Specific Provenance Extraction:** We utilize graph-neural-network-based (GNN) representations of EHR provenance and ICU clinical guidelines as retrieval sources, enabling fine-grained tracing of evidence backing LLM outputs.\n\n2. **Ethical and Factual Scoring Modules:** Separate evaluator modules produce quantitative ethical assessments (e.g., patient privacy adherence, compliance with ICU protocols) and factuality confidence scores, leveraging self-supervised representation learning on ICU datasets.\n\n3. **Integration Mechanism:** A differentiable, attention-weighted fusion module aggregates provenance, ethical, and factual scores to produce segment-level explanation components. Conflicting signals are resolved via a learned gating network that prioritizes clinically critical ethical constraints while maintaining factual consistency.\n\n4. **Natural Language Explanation Generator:** Conditioned on fused representations, a specialized explanation decoder produces coherent, user-understandable rationales, explicitly linking retrieval provenance and ethical considerations.\n\n5. **Interpretable Visualization Layer:** Complementing natural language explanations, schematic overlays using graded source highlighting and confidence score visualizations aid end-user interpretability.\n\nThe framework is illustrated via a formal model diagram detailing data flow, module interactions, and conflict resolution strategies, ensuring reproducibility and clarity.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement the modular framework integrating GNN-based provenance extraction from ICU EHR and clinical guidelines.\n2) Develop ethical and factual scoring modules trained on publicly available ICU datasets (e.g., MIMIC-III), incorporating domain expert-annotated ethical constraints.\n3) Design and train the attention-weighted fusion and gating network using multi-objective losses balancing faithfulness, ethical adherence, and explanation coherence.\n4) Conduct user studies with ICU clinicians and healthcare professionals to evaluate explanation quality, trust, and decision support utility.\n5) Benchmark against existing retrieval-augmented LLM explainability methods using quantitative metrics such as faithfulness, plausibility, and user trust scores.\n6) Extend the evaluation to forensic psychiatry reports as secondary use-case to test generalizability.\n7) Iterate explanation visualization designs based on clinician feedback to optimize usability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Recommend a treatment plan for a hypotensive ICU patient with kidney injury.\"\nOutput: \"Based on retrieved protocols from the latest ICU guidelines and patient-specific EHR data, the suggested treatment avoids nephrotoxic drugs and adheres to privacy constraints regarding sensitive lab results.\"\nExplanation: \"This recommendation cites ICU guideline section 5.2, verified with high factuality confidence (0.92), and the EHR-derived patient metadata provenance is highlighted. Ethical evaluation confirms compliance with patient privacy regulations by excluding sensitive data from retrieval. Conflict resolution prioritized ethics to remove unverified sources.\"",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should the full integration and explanation generation prove insufficiently faithful or too complex for reliable deployment, fallback approaches include:\n\n- Deploying schematic overlays emphasizing retrieval source provenance and presenting confidence/ethical compliance scores as visual badges.\n- Implementing simpler rule-based explanation templates that highlight critical ethical notes drawn directly from clinical guidelines, minimizing learning-based uncertainty.\n- Iteratively refining individual modules (e.g., gating mechanism) with additional domain expert input before full integration."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an explanation generation module linking ethical and factual evaluation scores to output segments via attention maps and provenance, but lacks sufficient detail on how these disparate signals will be effectively integrated and weighted to produce coherent, user-understandable explanations. Clarify the mechanism by which ethical considerations, factuality scores, and attention provenance are combined to generate explanations, and how the system resolves conflicting signals to maintain explanation faithfulness and transparency. Providing a diagram or formal model would strengthen the soundness here, enabling clearer understanding and reproducibility of the method design at this competitive research frontier. Without this, the approach risks being underspecified or overly optimistic in feasibility and interpretability assumptions, considering the inherent challenges in trustworthy explanation generation for neural retrieval-augmented models in high-stakes domains like medical recommendations or ethics-sensitive applications. This clarification is essential before extensive experiments are conducted or impact claims made, ensuring groundwork is solid and the module's interpretability claims are credible and testable in practice. This addresses soundness of the core mechanism, a foundational step for this important work's success and validity in the field. Targeting Proposed_Method section for refinement here is critical to move beyond a high-level concept to an actionable design that the community can evaluate and build upon robustly. "

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and the rich set of Globally-Linked Concepts, a key way to enhance the idea's impact and novelty is to ground the explanation generator concretely in a high-stakes real-world domain such as clinical decision support systems or forensic psychiatry. For example, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) and state-of-the-art representation learning (e.g., gated recurrent units or graph-neural-network-based models) could provide domain-specific provenance and ethical constraints tightly integrated with retrieval and generation. This domain focus would offer concrete evaluation benchmarks and user trust metrics not broadly available for generic retrieval-augmented LLM explanations, thus increasing both empirical rigor and societal impact. Consider extending the experiment plan to incorporate real-world datasets and stakeholder user studies from Intensive Care Unit or forensic psychiatric report scenarios, thereby bridging technical novelty with meaningful application. This domain integration will help differentiate the work substantially from existing explanation techniques, meeting both technical and ethical interpretability demands uniquely and raising the work’s profile at premier conference venues with multidisciplinary relevance. The Innovator should explicitly pursue such enriched global integration as a next critical step post preliminary design refinement for maximal contribution and uptake in the field."
