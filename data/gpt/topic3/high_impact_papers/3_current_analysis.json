These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.\"}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology', 'abstract': 'The Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology (ESST) addresses the grand challenge for science and engineering today.

Although Web mining uses many conventional data mining techniques, it is not purely an application of traditional data mining due to the semi-structured and unstructured nature of the Web data. The field has also developed many of its own algorithms and techniques. Liu has written a comprehensive text on Web mining, which consists of two parts. The first part covers the data mining and machine learning foundations, where all the essential concepts and algorithms of data mining and machine learning are presented. The second part covers the key topics of Web mining, where Web crawling, search, social network analysis, structured data extraction, information integration, opinion mining and sentiment analysis, Web usage mining, query log mining, computational advertising, and recommender systems are all treated both in breadth and in depth. His book thus brings all therelated concepts and algorithms together to form an authoritative and coherent text. The book offers a rich blend of theory and practice. It is suitable for students, researchers and practitioners interested in Web mining and data mining both as a learning text and as a reference book.

Beyond folk psychology and its naïve theories of learning, psychological learning theories can be grouped into some basic categories, such as behaviorist learning theories, connectionist learning theories, cognitive learning theories, constructivist learning theories, and social learning theories. Learning theories are not limited to psychology and related fields of interest but rather we can find the topic of learning in various disciplines, such as philosophy and epistemology, education, information science, biology, and – as a result of the emergence of computer technologies – especially also in the field of computer sciences and artificial intelligence. As a consequence, machine learning struck a chord in the 1980s and became an important field of the learning sciences in general. As the learning sciences\\xa0became more specialized and complex, the various fields of interest were widely spread and separated from each other; as a consequence, even presently, there is no comprehensive overview of\\xa0the\\xa0sciences of learning or the central theoretical concepts and vocabulary on which researchers rely.\\xa0\\xa0 The Encyclopedia of the\\xa0Sciences of Learning\\xa0provides an up-to-date, broad and authoritative coverage of the specific terms mostly used in the sciences of learning and its related fields, including relevant areas of instruction,pedagogy, cognitive sciences, and especially machine learning and knowledge engineering.

    "title": "Assessing Fairness and Bias Mitigation in LLMs Across Diverse NLP Applications: Research Landscape Map",
    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem addressed by this research cluster revolves around evaluating and improving fairness and bias mitigation in large language models (LLMs) used across diverse NLP applications. The local network analysis highlights a strong emphasis on policy evaluation and the role of policy makers within sustainability science and branches of science, indicating that research is framed not only around technical innovations but also around the governance and societal impact of LLMs. Dominant methods pivot around statistical and machine learning paradigms, including deep learning architectures and transfer learning approaches typified by foundation models (e.g., BERT, GPT-3). The foundational literature underscores the emergent capabilities of these models alongside the challenges in interpretability, data limitations, privacy, and legal constraints. The multidisciplinary nature includes influences from sustainability science, biomedicine, and statistical sciences, lending a systemic and evaluative lens on technology deployment in societal contexts.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: The analyzed foundational literature reveals several internal limitations—key among these are the inadequate interpretability of LLMs, limited understanding of failure modes, and the lack of transparent, standardized evaluation frameworks for fairness and bias across diverse applications. Moreover, the absence of bridge nodes connecting policy evaluation and statistics education clusters suggests insufficient integration of cross-domain expertise (e.g., policymakers with technical statisticians), which could hinder comprehensive fairness assessments and mitigations. Data scarcity and privacy challenges further restrict model fairness benchmarks and real-world applicability.\n\nExternal/Novel Gaps: The GPS global context analysis unveils a hidden bridge between sustainability science and branches of science mediated by concepts in environmental and agricultural sciences, alongside financial innovation themes. These have been largely overlooked within the focused NLP fairness research. Integrating sustainability frameworks and financial-sector rigor (such as performance evaluation and innovation outreach) could provide novel evaluation metrics and governance models for LLM fairness. For example, sustainability science’s emphasis on long-term impacts and systemic evaluation could enrich the assessment of societal fairness implications. Additionally, adopting visual analytics frameworks from forestry or agricultural sciences could enhance transparent model auditing and stakeholder communication, thus addressing interpretability gaps.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate sustainability science evaluation paradigms (from the hidden bridge linking sustainability and branches of science) with existing policy evaluation frameworks (local thematic island) to develop holistic, multi-dimensional fairness assessment frameworks that explicitly incorporate long-term societal and ethical impacts of LLM deployment.\n\nOpportunity 2: Leverage visual analytics techniques inspired by environmental sciences and financial innovation practices (global context) to build interactive, explainable interfaces for policymakers and stakeholders, bridging the gap between technical fairness metrics and actionable policy decisions for LLM governance.\n\nOpportunity 3: Establish interdisciplinary educational programs and collaborative platforms (connecting the statistics education and policy makers clusters) to co-develop fairness benchmarks and mitigation strategies that are statistically rigorous yet policy-relevant, thus addressing the internal gap of disconnected expertise and enhancing real-world applicability of bias mitigation in LLMs."
