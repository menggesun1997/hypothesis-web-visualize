    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) went from non-existent to ubiquitous in the\nmachine learning discourse within a few years. Due to the fast pace of the\nfield, it is difficult to identify the remaining challenges and already\nfruitful application areas. In this paper, we aim to establish a systematic set\nof open problems and application successes so that ML researchers can\ncomprehend the field's current state more quickly and become productive.",

    "abstract": "This open access book provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in research and applications of Foundation Models and is intended for readers familiar with basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts. Over the recent years, a revolutionary new paradigm has been developed for training models for NLP. These models are first pre-trained on large collections of text documents to acquire general syntactic knowledge and semantic information. Then, they are fine-tuned for specific tasks, which they can often solve with superhuman accuracy. When the models are large enough, they can be instructed by prompts to solve new tasks without any fine-tuning. Moreover, they can be applied to a wide range of different media and problem domains, ranging from image and video processing to robot control learning. Because they provide a blueprint for solving many tasks in artificial intelligence, they have been called Foundation Models. After a brief introduction tobasic NLP models the main pre-trained language models BERT, GPT and sequence-to-sequence transformer are described, as well as the concepts of self-attention and context-sensitive embedding. Then, different approaches to improving these models are discussed, such as expanding the pre-training criteria, increasing the length of input texts, or including extra knowledge. An overview of the best-performing models for about twenty application areas is then presented, e.g., question answering, translation, story generation, dialog systems, generating images from text, etc. For each application area, the strengths and weaknesses of current models are discussed, and an outlook on further developments is given. In addition, links are provided to freely available program code. A concluding chapter summarizes the economic opportunities, mitigation of risks, and potential developments of AI.",

    "abstract": "This volume presents the proceedings of Medicon 2016, held in Paphos, Cyprus. Medicon 2016 is the XIV in the series of regional meetings of the International Federation of Medical and Biological Engineering (IFMBE) in the Mediterranean. The goal of Medicon 2016 is to provide updated information on the state of the art on Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing under the main theme “Systems Medicine for the Delivery of Better Healthcare Services”. Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing cover complementary disciplines that hold great promise for the advancement of research and development in complex medical and biological systems. Research and development in these areas are impacting the science and technology by advancing fundamental concepts in translational medicine, by helping us understand human physiology and function at multiple levels, by improving tools and techniques for the detection, prevention and treatment of disease. Medicon 2016 provides a common platform for the cross fertilization of ideas, and to help shape knowledge and scientific achievements by bridging complementary disciplines into an interactive and attractive forum under the special theme of the conference that is Systems Medicine for the Delivery of Better Healthcare Services. The programme consists of some 290 invited and submitted papers on new developments around the Conference theme, presented in 3 plenary sessions, 29 parallel scientific sessions and 12 special sessions.",

The 10 full papers and one short paper included in this book were carefully reviewed and selected from 35 submissions. The conference focuses on authorship attribution, fake news detection and news tracking, noise-detection in automatically transferred relevance judgments, impact of online education on children’s conversational search behavior, analysis of multi-modal social media content, knowledge graphs for sensitivity identification, a fusion of deep learning and logic rules for sentiment analysis, medical concept normalization and domain-specific information extraction. In addition to this, the volume presents 7 “Best of the labs” papers which were reviewed as full paper submissions with the same review criteria. 13 lab overview papers were accepted and represent scientific challenges based on new datasets and real world problems in multimodal and multilingual information access.",

    "year": 2023,
    "citationCount": 21,
    "fieldCitationRatio": 12.76,
    "abstract": "Developing aerial robots that can both safely navigate and execute assigned mission without any human intervention – i.e., fully autonomous aerial mobility of passengers and goods – is the larger vision that guides the research, design, and development efforts in the aerial autonomy space. However, it is highly challenging to concurrently operationalize all types of aerial vehicles that are operating fully autonomously sharing the airspace. Full autonomy of the aerial transportation sector includes several aspects, such as design of the technology that powers the vehicles, operations of multi-agent fleets, and process of certification that meets stringent safety requirements of aviation sector. Thereby, Autonomous Advanced Aerial Mobility is still a vague term and its consequences for researchers and professionals are ambiguous. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive perspective on the emerging field of autonomous advanced aerial mobility, which involves the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for various applications, such as urban air mobility, package delivery, and surveillance. The article proposes a scalable and extensible autonomy framework consisting of four main blocks: sensing, perception, planning, and controls. Furthermore, the article discusses the challenges and opportunities in multi-agent fleet operations and management, as well as the testing, validation, and certification aspects of autonomous aerial systems. Finally, the article explores the potential of monolithic models for aerial autonomy and analyzes their advantages and limitations. The perspective aims to provide a holistic picture of the autonomous advanced aerial mobility field and its future directions.",

    "abstract": "The goal of the Encyclopedia of Operations Research and Management Science is to provide decision makers and problem solvers in business, industry, government and academia with a comprehensive overview of the wide range of ideas, methodologies, and synergistic forces that combine to form the pre-eminent decision-aiding fields of operations research and management science (OR/MS). The Second Edition is a further extension of this goal - which through addressing and solving a wide range of problems - OR/MS methodologies continue to flourish and grow. This is a field that is used extensively throughout the applied sciences, and, because of this, the new edition has added topics in the following areas: Analytic Network Process; Call Centers; Certainty Equivalence; Comb. Optimization by Simulated CE; Computational Organization; Constraint Programming; Data Mining; Degeneracy Graphs; Economic Order Q Extensions; Educational Issues in B-Schools; Electronic Commerce; Financial Markets; Global Climate Change; Hidden Markov Models; History of Early British OR; Implementation for Public Sector; Info Tech Benefits; Interactive Multi-Objective Math. Programming; Knapsacks with Nonlinearities; Little's Law in Distribution Form; Military Ops Other than War; Multivariate Quality Control; Perturbation Analysis; Simulation Metamodeling; Simulation Optimization; Supply Chain Management; Theory of Constraints; Timetabling. The intended audience of the Encyclopedia of Operations Research and Management Science is technically diverse and wide; it includes anyone concerned with the science, techniques, andideas of how one makes decisions. As this audience encompasses many professions, educational backgrounds and skills, we were attentive to the form, format and scope of the articles. Thus, the articles are designed to serve as initial sources of information for all such readers, with special emphasis on the needs of students. Each article provides a background or history of the topic, describes relevant applications, overviews present and future trends, and lists seminal and current references. To allow for variety in exposition, the authors were instructed to present their material from both research and applied perspectives. The Encyclopedia has been organized into specific topics that collectively encompass the foundations, applications, and emerging elements of this ever-changing field. We also wanted to establish the close associations that OR/MS has maintained with other scientific endeavors, with special emphasis on its symbiotic relationships to computer science, information processing, and mathematics. Based on our broad view of OR/MS, we commissioned 228 major expository articles and complemented them by numerous entries: descriptions, discussions, definitions, and abbreviations. The connections between topics are highlighted by an entry's final `See' statement, as appropriate. Each topical article provides a background or history of the topic, describes relevant applications, overviews present and future trends, and lists seminal and current references. Of significant importance is that each contributed topic has been authored by a leading authoritative researcher on that particular topic.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive review of loss functions and performance\nmetrics in deep learning, highlighting key developments and practical insights\nacross diverse application areas. We begin by outlining fundamental\nconsiderations in classic tasks such as regression and classification, then\nextend our analysis to specialized domains like computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing including retrieval-augmented generation. In each setting,\nwe systematically examine how different loss functions and evaluation metrics\ncan be paired to address task-specific challenges such as class imbalance,\noutliers, and sequence-level optimization. Key contributions of this work\ninclude: (1) a unified framework for understanding how losses and metrics align\nwith different learning objectives, (2) an in-depth discussion of multi-loss\nsetups that balance competing goals, and (3) new insights into specialized\nmetrics used to evaluate modern applications like retrieval-augmented\ngeneration, where faithfulness and context relevance are pivotal. Along the\nway, we highlight best practices for selecting or combining losses and metrics\nbased on empirical behaviors and domain constraints. Finally, we identify open\nproblems and promising directions, including the automation of loss-function\nsearch and the development of robust, interpretable evaluation measures for\nincreasingly complex deep learning tasks. Our review aims to equip researchers\nand practitioners with clearer guidance in designing effective training\npipelines and reliable model assessments for a wide spectrum of real-world\napplications.",
