    "title": "Privacy-Preserving Knowledge Retrieval with Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Filtering",
    "Problem_Statement": "Integrating retrieval augmentation in LLMs raises concerns about unintentional leakage of sensitive knowledge from proprietary databases during generation.",
    "Motivation": "Directly tackles the critical gap about privacy and trustworthiness at the ethics-IT industry intersection by applying adaptive neuro-fuzzy logic to filter or mask protected information dynamically.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement a neuro-fuzzy filter trained on privacy-sensitive examples that operates on retrieved documents before input to LLMs, evaluating sensitivity and masking particular data fields or altering representations without losing retrieval utility.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather datasets with annotated privacy-sensitive content; 2) Train neuro-fuzzy classifiers for privacy scores; 3) Integrate filter into retrieval pipeline; 4) Test on privacy leakage benchmarks and downstream task accuracy; 5) Iterate on filter sensitivity thresholds for optimal balance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Retrieve employee information related to project X for report.\" Output: retrieval excludes or redacts personal information, preserving compliance.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If filtering degrades task accuracy severely, explore post-generation privacy audits or use differential privacy mechanisms within retrieval augmentation."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes a neuro-fuzzy filter to evaluate sensitivity and mask data dynamically, but the mechanism lacks sufficient clarity on how the neuro-fuzzy system integrates with retrieval outputs and how it balances masking with utility preservation. Elaborate on the architecture and decision criteria of the neuro-fuzzy filter, including specifics on feature representation, rule formulation, and how continuous adaptation is ensured during inference to maintain retrieval relevance while enforcing privacy constraints robustly. Clarifying this will help validate the method's soundness and reproducibility, making it more convincing for reviewers and practitioners alike as a privacy-preserving augmentation to LLM retrieval pipelines. Suggest adding a detailed technical design subsection with pseudo-code or system flow diagrams in the next iteration of the proposal to enhance clarity and feasibility assessment."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating, consider integrating concepts from 'enterprise knowledge management' and 'computational intelligence' to create a broader, multi-agent system architecture where different adaptive neuro-fuzzy filters specialize in protecting distinct sensitive domains (e.g., personal vs corporate secrets). This modular context sharing could improve dynamic privacy risk assessment across heterogeneous databases, thereby elevating novelty and practical impact. Also, exploring synergy with 'machine learning' techniques like continual or federated learning can enable filter adaptation over time without centralized data exposure, boosting scalability and trustworthiness. This integration would position the approach closer to cutting-edge privacy-preserving knowledge systems in real-world enterprise or healthcare contexts, as hinted by linked concepts, and enhance the work's competitiveness and relevance at the ethics-IT frontier."
