    "title": "Sociolinguistic-Informed Explainability Framework for Domain-Specific LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a persistent lack of interpretability and trust in LLMs when deployed in domain-specific contexts such as legal and healthcare, due to the black-box nature and insufficient evaluation frameworks that fail to incorporate user-centered sociolinguistic factors.",
    "Motivation": "This idea directly tackles the internal gap of interpretability and the external gap identified by the hidden bridge between complex research methodologies (social science content analysis) and XAI for domain adaptation. It leverages social science methods to tailor explanations that are meaningful to stakeholders, addressing the lack of standardized, user-centric, domain-adaptive evaluation frameworks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid evaluation framework that integrates advanced sociolinguistic content analysis techniques (e.g., speech act theory, conversational implicature) with state-of-the-art XAI methods such as counterfactual explanations and saliency maps, tailored specifically for legal and medical LLM applications. This framework will model explanation preferences of domain experts through iterative human-in-the-loop refinement, combining qualitative coding of explanation outputs with quantitative evaluation metrics. The framework will be modular, allowing substituting or extending sociolinguistic analyses depending on the domain.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset: Curate domain-specific corpora (e.g., legal contracts, medical consultation transcripts) and fine-tune GPT-4 or similar LLMs.\n2) Collect explanation preference data from domain experts via surveys and think-aloud protocols.\n3) Implement and integrate social science content analysis tools for interpretability assessment.\n4) Develop metrics combining qualitative sociolinguistic codes with quantitative trust and interpretability scores.\n5) Benchmark against existing XAI frameworks on domain-specific tasks including question answering and summarization.\n6) Conduct user studies to evaluate explanation usefulness and trust enhancement.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Summarize the legal obligations stated in this contract clause.\" Expected Output: A structured summary highlighting key obligations alongside an explanation referencing specific linguistic cues and legal terms that justify the summary, with a sociolinguistic annotation indicating modality and prescriptive nature of statements.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If integrating sociolinguistic content analysis proves too complex or inconsistent, fallback to creating a semi-automated pipeline combining standard XAI tools and rule-based domain ontologies for interpretability. Alternatively, increase human-in-the-loop correction cycles or focus exclusively on one domain initially for depth over breadth."

        "title": "Sociolinguistic-Informed Human-Centered Explainability Framework for Knowledge-Intensive Domain-Specific LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) applied in sensitive and knowledge-intensive domains such as legal and healthcare remain largely black-box systems, resulting in limited interpretability and trust among domain experts. Existing explanation approaches often neglect the integration of sociolinguistic factors and cognitive workflows relevant to expert reasoning, and lack reproducible, scalable evaluation frameworks that bridge qualitative social science insights with quantitative metrics, impeding real-world deployment and adoption.",
        "Motivation": "While prior works have attempted to enhance LLM interpretability through general explainability methods, they insufficiently incorporate the sociolinguistic nuances and domain expert cognitive processes critical for meaningful explanations in specialized fields. Our approach addresses this gap by uniting sociolinguistic content analysis with human-centered AI principles and process discovery techniques, explicitly modeling domain-specific reasoning paths and conversational pragmatics. This novel, multi-disciplinary integration promises an adaptive, modular framework that advances beyond existing XAI methods by embedding user-centricity and knowledge-intensive task alignmentâ€”thereby increasing novelty and real-world impact within competitive AI and NLP spheres.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid, modular explainability framework combining: (1) advanced sociolinguistic content analysis (e.g., speech act theory, conversational implicature) to capture the pragmatic and modality aspects in explanations, (2) human-centered artificial intelligence paradigms embedding domain expert workflows and process discovery to dynamically uncover underlying reasoning chains from LLM outputs, and (3) robust NLP pipelines leveraging state-of-the-art XAI tools (e.g., counterfactual explanations, saliency maps) tailored to the legal and medical contexts. Our framework will quantify qualitative sociolinguistic codes through structured annotation schemas linked with scalable quantitative trust and interpretability metrics, operationalized via a novel integration mechanism that triangulates multiple evidence sources for reproducibility. Iterative human-in-the-loop refinement protocols will be designed based on agreement metrics and adjudication processes to manage annotator variability effectively. Ethical and privacy-preserving mechanisms, including data anonymization and secure handling, will be embedded throughout, recognizing domain sensitivities. This approach also generalizes to other knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and intelligent systems beyond initial target domains, supporting adaptability and scalability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Pilot Phase: Curate and anonymize domain-specific corpora (legal contracts, medical consultation transcripts) ensuring adherence to ethical standards.\n2) Annotation Schema Development: Collaborate with sociolinguists and domain experts to design a structured coding schema that links sociolinguistic phenomena with explanation facets.\n3) Preliminary Human Annotation & Reliability Analysis: Train annotators, conduct inter-annotator agreement studies, and refine schema for consistent quantitative mapping of qualitative codes.\n4) Implement Process Discovery Modules: Apply process mining techniques on LLM outputs to identify domain-specific reasoning pathways, integrating them with sociolinguistic annotations.\n5) Build Integration Pipeline: Develop a scalable system that combines sociolinguistic annotations, process discovery outputs, and standard XAI methods into composite trust and interpretability scores.\n6) Iterative Human-in-the-Loop Refinement: Deploy iterative cycles with domain experts to validate explanations, using agreement metrics to minimize subjectivity and improve explanation quality.\n7) Benchmarking & User Studies: Compare the framework against baseline explainability methods across legal and medical NLP tasks (e.g., question answering, summarization), measuring interpretability, trust, and cognitive alignment.\n8) Scalability & Generalization: Evaluate method transferability to other knowledge-intensive NLP applications.\nThroughout: Maintain strict data privacy and ethical compliance protocols.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Summarize the legal obligations stated in this contract clause.\"\nExpected Output: A structured, clear summary highlighting key obligations supported by an explanation referencing specific linguistic cues (e.g., modality, prescriptive language) and legal terminology, annotated with sociolinguistic labels (e.g., speech act type, conversational implicature). Furthermore, the explanation will expose the discovered domain-specific reasoning path that led to this summary, allowing the user to trace the inference chain and enhancing transparency and trust.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If integration of sociolinguistic content analysis with process discovery proves too complex or inconsistent, we will pivot to a phased approach: initially deploying a semi-automated pipeline combining established XAI techniques with rule-based domain ontologies while continuing incremental qualitative analyses. To manage interpretability evaluation challenges, we will increase annotation and human-in-the-loop cycles, focusing on deep validation within a single domain before expanding breadth. Additionally, we will incorporate synthetic or publicly available datasets to safeguard privacy while preserving methodological rigor, ensuring steady progress despite obstacles."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is ambitious and multifaceted but lacks detailed operationalization, particularly concerning the integration of sociolinguistic content analysis with quantitative evaluation metrics. Clarify how qualitative sociolinguistic coding will be reliably quantified and combined into trust scores to ensure reproducibility and scalability. Specify methodologies for iterative human-in-the-loop refinement to manage subjectivity and inter-annotator variability. Also, address data privacy and ethical considerations in using sensitive legal and medical text data. Strengthening these points will improve the scientific rigor and practical feasibility of the experiment plan, essential for successful real-world deployment and evaluation within resource and timeline constraints of top-tier research projects, especially at the intersection of social sciences and NLP/XAI frameworks. This is the critical bottleneck for validating the framework's soundness and practical impact in domain-specific applications without incurring prohibitive overhead or inconsistency in interpretation quality assessment frameworks.\n\nSuggestion: Include pilot studies or phased validation steps explicitly to isolate and refine the novel integration aspects before full-scale benchmarking and user studies, enhancing confidence in feasibility and trustworthiness of the framework's outputs and interpretations prior to wide user adoption or deployment in sensitive domains like law and medicine.\n\n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict of NOV-COMPETITIVE, the idea should better leverage synergies with broader impactful AI concepts to increase its competitiveness and influence. I recommend explicitly integrating principles from 'human-centered artificial intelligence' and 'knowledge-intensive tasks' to elevate user-centricity and domain expertise incorporation in the explanation framework. For example, embedding process discovery techniques to dynamically uncover domain-specific reasoning paths within LLM outputs can interface effectively with sociolinguistic analyses, enhancing explanation transparency along with the cognitive workflows of domain experts. Moreover, linking to core NLP tasks and intelligent systems advances the scalability and adaptability of the framework by incorporating robust NLP pipelines and explainability toolkits that generalize beyond just legal and medical text domains. Embedding this multi-disciplinary integration explicitly in the methodology and experiment plan will widen the potential impact horizon, avoid too narrow domain confinement, and position the work at the convergence of social science-informed XAI, core AI advances, and real-world knowledge-intensive applications, thereby addressing concerns about novelty and impact saturation in this competitive area.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
