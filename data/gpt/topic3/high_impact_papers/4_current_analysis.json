Over the recent years, a revolutionary new paradigm has been developed for training models for NLP. These models are first pre-trained on large collections of text documents to acquire general syntactic knowledge and semantic information. Then, they are fine-tuned for specific tasks, which they can often solve with superhuman accuracy. When the models are large enough, they can be instructed by prompts to solve new tasks without any fine-tuning. Moreover, they can be applied to a wide range of different media and problem domains, ranging from image and video processing to robot control learning. Because they provide a blueprint for solving many tasks in artificial intelligence, they have been called Foundation Models. After a brief introduction tobasic NLP models the main pre-trained language models BERT, GPT and sequence-to-sequence transformer are described, as well as the concepts of self-attention and context-sensitive embedding. Then, different approaches to improving these models are discussed, such as expanding the pre-training criteria, increasing the length of input texts, or including extra knowledge. An overview of the best-performing models for about twenty application areas is then presented, e.g., question answering, translation, story generation, dialog systems, generating images from text, etc. For each application area, the strengths and weaknesses of current models are discussed, and an outlook on further developments is given.

However, it is highly challenging to concurrently operationalize all types of aerial vehicles that are operating fully autonomously sharing the airspace. Full autonomy of the aerial transportation sector includes several aspects, such as design of the technology that powers the vehicles, operations of multi-agent fleets, and process of certification that meets stringent safety requirements of aviation sector. Thereby, Autonomous Advanced Aerial Mobility is still a vague term and its consequences for researchers and professionals are ambiguous. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive perspective on the emerging field of autonomous advanced aerial mobility, which involves the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for various applications, such as urban air mobility, package delivery, and surveillance. The article proposes a scalable and extensible autonomy framework consisting of four main blocks: sensing, perception, planning, and controls. Furthermore, the article discusses the challenges and opportunities in multi-agent fleet operations and management, as well as the testing, validation, and certification aspects of autonomous aerial systems. Finally, the article explores the potential of monolithic models for aerial autonomy and analyzes their advantages and limitations.

    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem in this research cluster focuses on understanding the current state, open problems, and application areas of Large Language Models (LLMs) within machine learning (ML) research, particularly emphasizing their use in financial markets and other NLP contexts. The dominant methods revolve around foundation models like BERT and GPT, using pre-training on extensive text corpora followed by fine-tuning or prompt-based adaptation. Core paradigms include zero-shot/few-shot learning, expansion of pre-training criteria, and integration of contextual embeddings and self-attention mechanisms. Thematic islands reveal active inquiry into both foundational language model capabilities and their application in specialized domains such as finance, signaling a dual focus on fundamental model design and domain-specific adaptation.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Although the papers outline many advances, they lack explicit bridges connecting foundational LLM research with domain-specific challenges like financial market applications, leading to siloed progress without adequate integration. Moreover, while computational efficiency and reliability are recognized goals, the surveyed literature provides limited insight into optimization strategies that explicitly balance these two criteria. There is also insufficient attention to automated loss function search and interpretable, robust evaluation metrics tailored for NLP tasks under efficiency-performance trade-offs. External/Novel Gaps: The global context highlights a hidden bridge between the concept of the 'current state' of LLM research and 'nascent literature' from biomedical domains involving complex biological systems modeling and sequencing data analysis. These bioinformatics contexts emphasize managing complexity, sequence fidelity, and system reliability in noisy, dynamic environments—challenges analogous to LLMs' reliability and efficiency in NLP. This cross-disciplinary connection has been overlooked and suggests that methodologies from membrane biogenesis, RNA sequencing analytics, or Markovian arrival processes could inspire new approaches to optimize computational efficiency while preserving model reliability, especially for sequence-sensitive NLP tasks.",
