    "title": "Cross-Domain Ethical Metric Transfer from Biomedical to Legal NLP Benchmarking",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current ethical evaluation metrics developed for biomedical NLP do not translate effectively to legal domain tasks, resulting in ethical lapses due to domain mismatch.",
    "Motivation": "Exploits the hidden bridge between academic benchmarks and ethics of AI by transferring and adapting ethically grounded biomedical metrics to the legal domain, addressing interpretability and cross-domain evaluation gaps.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a generalized ethical evaluation framework through domain adaptation techniques that reweight biomedical ethical constraints and benchmark them on legal NLP tasks (e.g., contract summarization, compliance checks) using multi-task learning for transfer.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Analyze biomedical ethical metrics and criteria; 2) Map relevant constraints to legal domain via expert consultation; 3) Construct multi-domain datasets; 4) Train and evaluate retrieval-augmented LLMs with adapted metrics; 5) Compare ethical compliance and accuracy vs. domain-specific baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Summarize legal risks in the new contract clause.\" Expected Output: Ethical compliance ensures confidential info omitted and no misleading interpretation is presented.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "Should transfer fail, focus on lightweight combined metrics or domain-specific ethical rule sets to enhance evaluation guidance."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that ethical evaluation metrics from biomedical NLP can be effectively adapted and transferred to the legal domain via domain adaptation and multi-task learning. However, biomedical and legal domains differ greatly in data types, ethical concerns (e.g., patient privacy vs. legal confidentiality and interpretation risks), and normative constraints. This substantial divergence may invalidate the core assumption that a generalized ethical metric can be meaningfully constructed via reweighting biomedical constraints alone. It is essential to empirically justify or theoretically outline why biomedical ethical criteria are adaptable to legal tasks beyond expert consultation, and to clarify differences and commonalities in ethical concerns between these domains to strengthen the soundness of the assumption in the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections. Otherwise, the foundation of the approach risks being too fragile or oversimplified, compromising the study's validity and impact potential. Recommendations: provide a more rigorous domain ethics comparison and justify transferability assumptions explicitly with scholarly grounding or preliminary validation evidence in the revised manuscript and methodology description (e.g., in Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method)."

        {
          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines logical stages, yet the plan lacks detail on critical feasibility factors: the availability and construction method of multi-domain datasets combining biomedical and legal ethical constraints, the criteria and process of expert consultations, and the validation strategy for ethical compliance in legal NLP tasks. Particularly, ethical compliance assessment is inherently complex and subjective; how will it be measured quantitatively or qualitatively? The plan also omits how retrieval-augmented large language models will be adapted or fine-tuned with these ethical metrics, and how domain adaptation or multi-task learning will be concretely operationalized and evaluated. Without these clarifications, the proposed experiments risk being impractical or insufficiently rigorous to validate the method's effectiveness. Recommendations: enhance the Experiment_Plan section with concrete descriptions of dataset design, ethical compliance evaluation protocols (including human-in-the-loop evaluation if applicable), model adaptation strategies, and clear metrics for both ethical and task performance. Adding pilot experiment results or feasibility analyses would further strengthen this section."
