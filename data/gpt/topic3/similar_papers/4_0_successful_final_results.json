    "title": "Federated Synthetic Data Distillation for Privacy-Aware Intrusion Detection",
    "Problem_Statement": "Deploying large-scale LLMs for intrusion detection in privacy-sensitive environments is hindered by data scarcity, heterogeneity, and privacy concerns. Conventional federated learning faces communication inefficiencies and struggles with non-IID data distributions, while data distillation has yet to be fully leveraged in this context.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses internal gaps around privacy, data scarcity, and federated learning limitations, and exploits the hidden bridge between clinical data distillation and cybersecurity datasets, by integrating privacy-preserving synthetic data distillation into federated intrusion detection training frameworks for resource-constrained edge devices.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel framework combining federated learning with locally generated synthetic data distillation. Each client distills its sensitive local intrusion detection dataset into a compressed, privacy-preserving synthetic dataset via generative models guided by differential privacy. These synthetic datasets are communicated instead of raw data or gradients, improving communication efficiency and privacy. The central server aggregates distilled synthetic data summaries to train a global intrusion detection model. The approach incorporates adaptability to heterogeneous client distributions and models parameter size constraints through lightweight hybrid transformer-RNN architectures tailored for edge deployment.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect heterogeneous intrusion detection datasets mimicking distributed environments, including privacy-sensitive data. 2) Develop synthetic data distillation modules with differential privacy guarantees. 3) Implement federated learning framework exchanging distilled synthetic data. 4) Design lightweight hybrid transformer-RNN models for clients and server. 5) Evaluate on benchmarks for intrusion detection (e.g., NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017) comparing detection accuracy, privacy leakage, communication cost, and model size metrics against classical federated learning and centralized baselines. 6) Analyze robustness to non-IID client data and scalability to number of clients.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Local network traffic logs on an edge client with sensitive information. Distilled synthetic dataset uses generative modeling to produce anonymized traffic patterns. Output: Federatedly trained intrusion detection model with high detection accuracy and minimal privacy compromise, able to flag malicious traffic patterns across distributed nodes, maintaining real-time feasibility on resource-constrained devices.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If synthetic data distillation causes degradation in detection performance, fallback includes hybrid schemes sending distilled gradient summaries combined with data augmentation to improve synthetic data quality. Alternatively, explore compressed model updates with secure aggregation to enhance privacy. Additional debugging involves validating privacy budgets and adjusting generative model complexity."

        "title": "Adaptive Federated Reinforced Synthetic Data Distillation for Privacy-Preserving IoT Intrusion Detection under Heterogeneous Non-IID Conditions",
        "Problem_Statement": "Deploying large-scale, privacy-aware intrusion detection systems for IoT networks involves unique challenges owing to highly heterogeneous, non-IID data distributions, stringent privacy constraints on sensitive local data, communication bottlenecks, and limited computational resources on edge devices. Traditional federated learning approaches struggle to ensure robust global model convergence and adaptability under these conditions, especially given the evolving nature of IoT traffic as temporal sequences and emerging attack behaviors. Additionally, while synthetic data distillation can reduce communication overhead and protect privacy, systematic mechanisms to aggregate diverse, privacy-budgeted synthetic datasets for stable federated training are lacking. Therefore, there is a critical need for an adaptive federated learning framework that integrates privacy-preserving synthetic data distillation with temporal anomaly detection and dynamic reinforcement learning-based client optimization to tackle non-IID data heterogeneity, resource constraints, and evolving intrusion patterns in IoT environments.",
        "Motivation": "This work seeks to advance privacy-aware federated intrusion detection by addressing two key gaps: (1) the absence of rigorous mechanisms to harmonize heterogeneous synthetic distilled datasets aggregated under diverse privacy budgets ensuring stable and unbiased global model training in non-IID, resource-constrained IoT settings; and (2) the under-explored potential of leveraging time-series anomaly detection and reinforcement learning to dynamically adapt federated learning strategies per client context and temporal traffic patterns. By integrating these elements, our approach extends beyond existing federated synthetic data distillation methods to produce a novel, efficient, and resilient intrusion detection framework tailored to next-generation IoT edge-AI deployments. This integration uniquely enhances privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and detection robustness, positioning the work competitively within current research frontiers and demonstrating broad applicability for resilient cybersecurity in distributed systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel Adaptive Federated Reinforced Synthetic Data Distillation (AFR-SDD) framework combining the following elements: (1) Locally at each edge client, sensitive intrusion detection datasets—modeled as temporal sequences—are distilled into compact, privacy-preserving synthetic datasets using generative time-series anomaly detection models integrated with differential privacy mechanisms. Clients maintain heterogeneous, bounded privacy budgets adjusted dynamically via a client-side reinforcement learning (RL) agent, which optimizes the trade-off between privacy, synthetic data quality, and resource consumption by observing local intrusion pattern changes and resource availability over time. (2) To address heterogeneity and non-IID distributions, the central server employs a formalized synthetic data aggregation mechanism that 1) weights incoming synthetic datasets based on estimated generative quality and privacy budgets, 2) filters potential biases/noise using robust statistical aggregation and representation alignment techniques, and 3) incrementally updates a global intrusion detection model using a hybrid lightweight transformer-RNN architecture optimized for time-series data. This ensures model convergence and stability despite client variability. (3) The global model updates and policies from the central server are transmitted back to clients; the clients’ RL agents use these insights to refine local synthetic data distillation parameters adaptively, enabling context-aware, temporally sensitive federated learning cycles. This closed-loop dynamic synergy enables efficient, privacy-preserving, and scalable intrusion detection suited for diverse IoT environments with constrained communication and compute budgets.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate and preprocess heterogeneous, labeled intrusion detection time-series datasets (e.g., NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017, and IoT-specific traffic datasets) to simulate realistic distributed, non-IID client environments. 2) Implement local synthetic data distillation modules combining differential privacy with recurrent generative anomaly detection methods, and develop RL agents to dynamically tune privacy-utility trade-offs per client. 3) Design and formalize the synthetic data aggregation mechanism at the server including weighting, bias-filtering, and robust fusion strategies. 4) Develop the hybrid transformer-RNN global intrusion detection model optimized for time-series and edge deployment efficiency. 5) Integrate full AFR-SDD framework for experimental federated training cycles. 6) Evaluate detection accuracy, communication cost, privacy leakage, model convergence, robustness to non-IID data, adaptability to evolving intrusion patterns, and computational overhead against classical FL, static synthetic distillation FL, and state-of-the-art baselines in IoT intrusion detection. 7) Conduct ablation studies to isolate reinforcement learning impact and aggregation strategy effectiveness. 8) Analyze scalability to many clients and varying privacy budgets.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A battery-powered IoT edge device locally observes network traffic logs containing sensitive user information and evolving intrusion behaviors over time. The RL agent adjusts local differential privacy parameters and synthetic data generation quality in real-time based on resource availability and anomaly detections. The distilled synthetic time-series datasets, anonymized and compressed, are transmitted to the central server. Output: The federatedly trained global intrusion detection model—updated through robust aggregation of heterogeneous synthetic datasets—achieves high detection accuracy (>95%) for known and emerging attacks, maintains strong privacy guarantees (formal DP bounds), reduces communication overhead by >50% compared to gradient sharing, and adapts dynamically to changing IoT network traffic patterns. The model runs efficiently on resource-limited edge devices, enabling real-time flagging of malicious activities across distributed nodes while preserving user privacy and system scalability.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If synthetic data distillation yields inferior detection performance due to generative quality limitations or RL optimization convergence issues, fallback strategies include: (1) Hybrid communication schemes combining distilled synthetic data with compressed gradient or model update summaries, augmented by robust privacy-preserving data augmentation techniques to enhance representativeness. (2) Employ secure multi-party computation for aggregated model updates to reinforce privacy without synthetic data dependency. (3) Simplify RL agents to heuristic-based privacy-utility tuning or pre-defined schedules; (4) Refine privacy budgets and generative model architectures through targeted hyperparameter tuning informed by detailed privacy leakage and performance audits until stability and accuracy targets are met. Debugging will focus on privacy budget exactness, generative model fidelity, and aggregation mechanism correctness, with fallback to more classical federated learning paradigms as necessary to maintain privacy-compliant detection capabilities under resource constraints."

However, the mechanism for aggregating synthetic distilled datasets at the server and ensuring model convergence and robustness under highly heterogeneous, non-IID data distributions requires clearer explication. The process by which synthetic datasets from diverse clients, each potentially with different generative quality and privacy budgets, are harmonized and leveraged to train a global intrusion detection model must be detailed to confirm soundness and practicality.

For example, incorporating adaptive federated synthetic data distillation driven by reinforcement learning agents on clients might dynamically optimize privacy-utility trade-offs and model updates based on observed intrusion patterns over time-series traffic data typical for IoT devices. This could yield more resilient and efficient real-time intrusion detection adapted per client resource constraints and evolving attack scenarios.\n\nSuch integration would extend beyond static synthetic data distillation by enabling intelligent, context-aware federated learning strategies that exploit domain-specific temporal dynamics and enhance privacy preservation. Leveraging these globally linked concepts can robustly differentiate the work and unlock broader applicability within next-generation distributed systems and edge-AI for cybersecurity."
