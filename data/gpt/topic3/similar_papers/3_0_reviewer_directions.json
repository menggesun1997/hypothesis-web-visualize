    "title": "Multimodal Human-in-the-Loop Bias Auditing for Clinical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs adapted to biomedical domains exhibit persistent biases that adversely affect decision-making across diverse patient subgroups, particularly in clinical settings. Existing bias auditing tools lack integration of domain expert feedback during the model lifecycle, limiting effective bias identification and mitigation.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the internal gap of insufficient human-in-the-loop mechanisms and the external gap of embedding health professionals' perspectives within AI pipelines, as identified in the Research Landscape. By integrating direct stakeholder engagement from clinicians in a structured, multimodal bias auditing framework, it innovates beyond current static bias evaluation methods.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a human-in-the-loop multimodal bias auditing system combining clinical textual notes, medical images, and LLM outputs. The system engages health professionals via interactive dashboards that highlight potential bias signals detected from model outputs and input data distributions. Clinicians provide real-time annotations on bias relevance and severity, which are encoded and fed back to adjust model fine-tuning dynamically through continual learning protocols. The framework also incorporates patient subgroup metadata for granular bias tracking and iterative interpretability modules to explain model rationale.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect diverse biomedical datasets with patient subgroup annotations including clinical notes and associated images (e.g., MIMIC-IV, CheXpert). 2) Fine-tune a foundation LLM on biomedical data. 3) Implement the bias signal detection engine based on statistical disparities and representational analyses. 4) Build a clinician-facing interface for bias feedback. 5) Conduct iterative human-in-the-loop fine-tuning cycles leveraging clinician annotations. 6) Evaluate bias reduction using fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity difference, equalized odds) on held-out subgroups, alongside clinical relevance assessed through expert surveys.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical text describing a chest X-ray report referencing symptoms in an elderly female patient subgroup. Model output initially underestimates pneumothorax risk for elderly women. After clinician bias annotation via the system highlighting subgroup underprediction, the model updates its risk estimation. Output: Adjusted risk prediction reflecting appropriate pneumothorax risk for elderly female patients, increasing fairness and clinical trustworthiness.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time clinician feedback proves logistically challenging, simulate human-in-the-loop annotations using synthetic expert knowledge bases and retrospective bias labels. Alternatively, enhance model interpretability modules to allow automated bias explanations facilitating self-correction without immediate human input."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan, while thorough in detailing data collection, model fine-tuning, bias detection, and iterative clinician feedback, lacks discussion about practical challenges in recruiting, engaging, and retaining domain experts (clinicians) for real-time interactive bias annotation. Real-time human-in-the-loop feedback in clinical settings may face logistical and calibration issues, including alignment on bias definitions and time constraints on busy professionals. To increase feasibility, the experimental plan should explicitly incorporate strategies for clinician recruitment, scheduling, annotation interface usability testing, and contingency protocols beyond the fallback plan, such as active learning to minimize clinician burden or pilot studies validating the annotation process prior to full-scale iteration cycles. Clarifying these operational details will strengthen confidence in executing the plan realistically and under resource constraints without compromising rigor or clinician goodwill, which is crucial for success in human-centered clinical AI research. Targeting this will ensure the method’s real-world applicability and scalability in clinical environments, beyond purely technical feasibility demonstrated through datasets and model metrics alone. This critique targets the 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' section for enhancing scientific soundness and practical feasibility of the human-in-the-loop paradigm implementation in clinical settings.  \n\n---\n\n[SUGGESTION: Incorporate explicit clinician engagement methodology, usability studies, and stepwise pilot evaluations into the experiment plan to address operational feasibility gaps on human-in-the-loop feedback implementation.]"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the conceived multimodal human-in-the-loop bias auditing system tailored for clinical LLMs, a strong avenue to amplify both impact and novelty is the integration of global health perspectives, especially from large-scale international bodies like the International Union of Nutritional Sciences. Their guidelines and data on nutritional disparities affecting diverse populations could serve as a valuable external validation layer for detected biases or a source to extend the bias auditing framework to cross-national demographic and health variance. This can catalyze generalization of the approach beyond individual hospital systems and offer a benchmark for equitable AI-driven clinical decision support under varied nutritional, socioeconomic, and ethnic contexts worldwide. Embedding such globally-linked biomedical knowledge and stakeholder standards into the human-in-the-loop feedback loops or interpretability modules enriches the auditing rigor and translational value, positioning the research in a more competitive niche with tangible, far-reaching clinical policy implications. This suggestion directly relates to broadening the framework’s scope and grounding it in globally relevant health disparities, addressing dynamic clinical needs collaboratively with international scientific communities, which is highly valued in premier conferences and critical funding bodies.  \n\n---\n\n[SUGGESTION: Collaborate with or incorporate frameworks from internationally recognized bodies such as the International Union of Nutritional Sciences to enhance bias auditing robustness, domain relevance, and demonstrate wider impact beyond local clinical settings.]"
