    "title": "Unified Evaluation Framework Incorporating Ethics and Trust Dimensions for Medical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing evaluation metrics for medical NLP models primarily focus on accuracy and neglect critical user-centered parameters such as ethics, empathy, and trustworthiness, resulting in deficient assessments that limit clinical adoption.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to internal gap #1 about insufficient evaluation metrics integrating user-centered factors, and the identified need for unified evaluation frameworks bridging fragmented methodologies centered on 'artificial intelligence,' 'natural language processing,' and 'AI performance.'",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a comprehensive evaluation framework combining quantitative NLP metrics (precision, recall), fairness audits, ethical compliance checks (e.g., bias, misinformation detection), and trust measures derived from user studies. The framework operationalizes these dimensions into standardized benchmarks for medical LLMs, supporting both simulated scenarios and real clinical conversations, complemented by open-source tooling for easy adoption.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Survey existing evaluation tools and user-centered parameters.\n2. Design multi-tier evaluation criteria with clear operational definitions.\n3. Develop datasets annotated for ethical and trust-related attributes.\n4. Implement automated and human-in-the-loop evaluation pipelines.\n5. Apply the framework to leading medical LLMs across tasks.\n6. Validate correlation between framework scores and physician acceptance.\n7. Release framework and benchmarks to the community.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM-generated response to a patient query containing ambiguous prognosis information.\nExpected Output: Evaluation scores reflecting content accuracy, ethical standards (non-misleading), empathy levels, and trust indicators, with detailed diagnostics highlighting potential issues.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If formalizing ethics/trust metrics proves difficult, start with proxy measures like bias audits and factuality checks. Gradually incorporate more complex human-centered assessments through iterative refinement."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan covers a comprehensive and well-structured approach, several key feasibility challenges require attention. Specifically, developing datasets annotated for ethical and trust attributes (Step 3) is notoriously difficult due to subjective interpretations, potential annotator bias, and scarcity of gold standards. It would strengthen the plan to include detailed annotation protocols, inter-annotator agreement strategies, and consideration of domain expert involvement to ensure quality. Additionally, validating correlations between framework scores and physician acceptance (Step 6) may require extensive user studies with diverse clinical populations, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. Specifying contingency plans or phased milestones to address these logistical constraints would enhance the plan's practicality and increase confidence in eventual successful framework deployment. Please clarify these points in the Experiment_Plan section to improve feasibility robustness and operational clarity."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty was rated as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the field is highly active, a strong way to boost impact and distinctiveness is to explicitly integrate relevant concepts from the linked globally-connected domains, such as technology acceptance models and human-in-the-loop systems in mental health care and suicide prevention contexts. For instance, adapting trust and ethics evaluation criteria tailored to critical applications like suicide prevention counseling could both deepen the framework's relevance and demonstrate measurable clinical impact. Furthermore, including metrics that assess the system's uptake and acceptance by mental health professionals in real-world scenarios would concretely link ethics and trustworthiness to technology adoption. Embedding these global concepts into the Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan sections can differentiate the framework by bridging evaluation with critical real-world human-centered outcomes, making the contribution more compelling for premier conference audiences."
