    "title": "Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Privacy-Preserving Local Clinical NLP",
    "Problem_Statement": "RAG systems face challenges with data privacy and adaptation when deployed locally in clinics, hindering widespread medical NLP usage.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap in privacy/adaptation infrastructure by proposing a federated learning RAG framework that enables decentralized training of domain-specific retrieval and generation components across multiple local clinical sites without sharing sensitive data.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement a federated RAG architecture where each client trains local retrieval indices and prompt-engineered generation models, communicating only encrypted model updates to a central server. Retrieval databases remain local, ensuring patient data privacy while improving global domain adaptation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Simulate federated environments with multiple local clinical datasets. 2. Implement encrypted communication protocols for model aggregation. 3. Baselines: centralized training vs federated approach. 4. Metrics: clinical accuracy, privacy leakage risk, adaptation speed.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical query from local behavioral therapy clinic. Output: Accurate, up-to-date response based on local data and global federated knowledge without exposing patient info externally.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated training causes performance degradation, hybridize with selectively sharing anonymized embeddings or synthetic data augmentation."

          "feedback_content": "The description of the federated RAG architecture lacks clarity on how the system will effectively integrate retrieval and generation components in a federated setting. Specifically, it's unclear how encrypted model updates from heterogeneous clients will be aggregated to ensure consistent and coherent generation outputs across clinical sites. Please provide detailed architectural design and rationale clarifying how retrieval indices trained locally are synchronized or leveraged during generation, and how privacy guarantees are upheld without compromising cross-client model synergy or clinical accuracy. This detail is critical to validate the soundness of the proposed approach's mechanism for achieving privacy-preserving adaptation in clinical NLP contexts without data sharing or leakage risks, especially considering the complexity of RAG models and their dual-component nature in a federated environment.\n\nAdditionally, please elaborate on how prompt-engineering is incorporated within local generation models and how it adapts over federated rounds, including communication overhead and model convergence considerations. Addressing these points will reinforce the robustness and operational viability of the method described in Proposed_Method."

          "feedback_content": "The planned experiments, while well-organized, require more precise delineation of the federated simulation environment and experimental controls to ensure reproducibility and meaningful evaluation. Details are needed regarding the selection, size, and heterogeneity of the local clinical datasets used in simulation, including how they reflect realistic inter-site data distribution shifts and privacy constraints (e.g., variations in patient demographics, modality of notes).\n\nMoreover, the encryption protocols for communication must be specified or referenced to assess feasibility, including computational overhead and potential bottlenecks in federated aggregation.\n\nIn terms of evaluation metrics, 'clinical accuracy', 'privacy leakage risk', and 'adaptation speed' need operational definitions with appropriate quantitative measures (e.g., accuracy on clinical NLP tasks, differential privacy guarantees or metrics, convergence time or communication rounds until satisfactory performance).\n\nFurthermore, please plan ablation studies or control experiments (e.g., effect of varying number of clients, mitigation strategies in fallback scenarios) to robustly establish the trade-offs between privacy and model performance. This will ensure the experiments adequately test the core claims and guide potential real-world deployment."
