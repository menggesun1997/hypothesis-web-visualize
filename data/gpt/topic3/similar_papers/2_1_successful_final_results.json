    "title": "Hybrid Actor–Critic Prompting Coupled with Real-Time Filtered Retrieval for Medical NLP",
    "Problem_Statement": "Separately applied advanced prompting and retrieval methods have not been systematically optimized together, leaving a gap in achieving high accuracy and interpretability in high-stakes medical NLP tasks.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap related to the under-explored integration of prompt engineering and retrieval strategies. Novelty lies in tightly coupling actor–critic style prompt optimization with a dynamically filtered retrieval process, leveraging the 'language model' bridge node for end-to-end system optimization.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a hybrid architecture where an actor module generates candidate prompts, a critic module evaluates generated outputs based on clinical fidelity, and a retrieval module filters and supplies contextually relevant domain documents in real-time. The language model is fine-tuned jointly using reinforcement learning to maximize accuracy and interpretability metrics concurrently.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use medical Q&A datasets, e.g., rheumatology and behavioral therapy clinical queries. 2. Implement actor–critic prompting algorithms integrated with a retrieval pipeline querying vector databases with semantic filters. 3. Baselines: separate RAG, prompt-only optimized LLMs. 4. Metrics: clinical accuracy, interpretability, retrieval precision, hallucination rate. 5. Evaluate on unseen clinical contexts and measure robustness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Explain side effects of common CBT medications.\" Output: Accurate explanation supported by filtered retrieval results, with clearly attributable knowledge and minimal hallucination, alongside interpretability rationale from critic feedback.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If joint training proves unstable, decouple training stages with meta-learning or curriculum learning. Alternatively, employ human evaluation to recalibrate critic reward signals."

        "title": "Hybrid Actor–Critic Prompting Coupled with Real-Time Filtered Retrieval for Medical NLP: A Robust and Clinically-Grounded Framework",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing approaches in medical NLP either optimize prompt engineering or retrieval mechanisms separately, often leading to suboptimal accuracy and interpretability in clinical contexts where stakes are high. However, joint optimization attempts suffer from unclear justifications regarding their superiority over sequential or separate methods, and lack rigorous grounding in clinical fidelity assessment. Moreover, capturing nuanced clinical knowledge and minimizing hallucinations remain significant challenges, as existing reward signals for reinforcement learning often fail to incorporate domain-expert insights comprehensively. This research addresses the critical unmet need for a robust, clinically grounded integration of prompt optimization and retrieval filtering that explicitly models and validates the interplay between generated outputs and retrieved medical evidence, ensuring safer, more accurate, and interpretable NLP models in healthcare.",
        "Motivation": "The novelty of this work is in explicitly bridging the gap between prompt-based language model optimization and real-time contextually filtered retrieval through a unified actor–critic framework that is both theoretically and empirically grounded in clinical expertise. Unlike existing methods that treat retrieval and prompting as independent or loosely coupled modules, our approach leverages model-based deep reinforcement learning with a clinician-in-the-loop proxy reward system, simulating domain expert feedback to more realistically and reliably guide the learning process. This integration addresses core challenges of accuracy, hallucination reduction, and interpretability trade-offs in medical NLP, offering a fundamentally more competitive and representative solution suited for safety-critical healthcare applications. Incorporating advanced neural architectures such as graph neural networks enables richer context modeling of medical entities, aiding the interpretability of decisions and the retrieval precision within the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) ecosystem, where data is often scarce and noisy.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel hybrid architecture composed of three tightly integrated components: (1) an actor module that generates candidate prompts to query the language model, enhanced with long short-term memory (LSTM) layers to better capture sequential clinical context; (2) a critic module employing graph neural networks (GNNs) trained with domain-annotated medical knowledge graphs to evaluate outputs on clinical fidelity, hallucination risk, and interpretability, incorporating a model-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm for stable joint optimization; (3) a retrieval component that performs real-time filtered semantic search over dynamically updated vector embeddings of medical literature and patient records from IoMT data holders, applying kernel learning techniques for precision filtering. To overcome sparse clinical reward signals, the critic's reward function is bootstrapped using a clinician-in-the-loop simulated environment that employs surrogate metrics grounded in clinical decision support rules and gradient boosted tree models pre-trained on small but high-quality labeled datasets. Training proceeds in curriculum stages: starting with retrieval-only tuning, followed by isolated actor-critic prompt fine-tuning, and finally fully joint optimization, with the option to decouple phases if instability is detected. This approach leverages deep reinforcement learning advances alongside neural network interpretability modules and dialog system frameworks optimized for healthcare workflows, ensuring a robust, clinically relevant outcome.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset Selection: Utilize curated, clinically representative datasets including annotated rheumatology Q&A and behavioral therapy treatment dialogues, supplemented with data curated from IoMT devices to reflect real-world noisy conditions.\n2. Baseline Implementations: Establish comparative baselines including separate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without joint training, prompt-only optimized LLMs, and standard actor-critic models without retrieval filtering.\n3. Training Protocol: Implement the staged curriculum training pipeline incorporating model-based deep RL with the clinician-in-the-loop proxy system. Monitor stability and convergence criteria with fail-safe decoupling conditions.\n4. Retrieval Filtering: Develop and evaluate the semantic filtering mechanism based on kernel learning, with metrics on retrieval precision, recall, and latency in real-time simulated settings.\n5. Metrics: Employ multi-faceted evaluation including clinical accuracy verified by domain experts, interpretability scored via GNN explanation fidelity, hallucination rate measured by factual consistency checks, and retrieval precision.\n6. Robustness Testing: Test on unseen clinical queries spanning diverse specialties and patient conditions, including challenging IoMT-generated noisy inputs, to assess generalizability.\n7. Human Expert Validation: Conduct post-hoc expert evaluation sessions, calibrating critic reward functions and collecting feedback for iterative improvements.\n8. Ablation Studies: Analyze effects of each architectural component and training stage on overall performance and training stability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Explain side effects of common CBT medications in elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis, considering co-morbidities.\"\nOutput: A medically accurate explanation explicitly grounded in retrieved, up-to-date filtered studies and clinical guidelines, accompanied by an interpretable rationale derived from the critic's evaluation using GNN attention visualizations. The output minimizes hallucination by cross-verifying statements with retrieved documents, with clear attribution showing how the retrieval influenced the prompt and final answer generation. Any clinical uncertainties or limitations are transparently flagged according to the critic's confidence metrics.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Recognizing potential joint training instability and data scarcity, we propose a staged fallback: (1) Decouple training with explicit curriculum learning — first optimize retrieval filtering on static datasets, then independently train actor-critic prompt modules; (2) Introduce meta-learning techniques to adapt critic reward calibration dynamically based on incremental human expert evaluations; (3) Employ synthetic clinical interaction simulations to augment sparse labels; (4) Utilize transfer learning from related healthcare dialog systems and knowledge bases to improve sample efficiency; (5) If reinforcement learning proves infeasible, fallback to supervised fine-tuning augmented with post-hoc retrieval confidence re-ranking guided by clinician feedback; (6) Throughout, maintain continuous integration of human-in-the-loop evaluations to recalibrate and validate system outputs, ensuring safety and clinical fidelity remain paramount."

          "feedback_content": "The problem statement assumes that a joint optimization of actor-critic prompting with real-time filtered retrieval will yield improved accuracy and interpretability in medical NLP tasks; however, it does not sufficiently justify why existing separate or sequential approaches fail or where the joint coupling specifically addresses critical shortcomings. Clarify and support these assumptions experimentally or theoretically to strengthen the soundness of the approach, particularly in a high-stakes domain like healthcare where errors carry significant risks, and accuracy trade-offs are sensitive to prompt/retrieval interplay nuances. Also, ensure that the assumption that clinical fidelity can be effectively captured by a critic module's reward signal is realistic and grounded in domain expertise or empirical validation frameworks that account for subtle clinical knowledge nuances and hallucination risks inherent in language models in medical contexts. Strengthening these assumptions would make the proposed methodology more credible and targeted to the unmet needs stated in the problem statement."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The experiment plan appears comprehensive but could face feasibility challenges in the joint reinforcement learning (RL) setup, as RL is often unstable especially in combined actor-critic architectures with external retrieval components in medical NLP where labeled clinical fidelity feedback is scarce and expensive. The fallback plan to decouple training or rely on human evaluators is good but should be more explicitly detailed upfront with clear success/failure criteria. Additionally, clarify and justify the choice of datasets for clinical representativeness and the practical approach for retrieval filtering semantics and precision metrics in real-time settings. Without more concrete detail, the proposed method’s feasibility risks being undermined by unstable training, insufficient data for high-quality rewards, or mismatch in evaluation metrics that may fail to capture critical clinical accuracy and interpretability trade-offs. Propose more concrete steps to overcome these challenges, such as simulated environments or domain-expert-in-the-loop proxies early in training."
