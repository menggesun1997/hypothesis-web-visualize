    "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Experimental Platform for Fairness Benchmarking in Clinical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Benchmarks for evaluating fairness and bias mitigation in clinical LLMs lack incorporation of social, communicative, and organizational dimensions essential for holistic assessments, leading to partial evaluations that miss real-world impact nuances.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by the novel external gaps involving communication, media studies, and organizational aspects, this idea proposes a cross-disciplinary experimental platform combining social science-informed metrics with technical fairness measures for richer evaluations, expanding beyond the isolated biomedical AI tradelines.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an open experimental platform integrating quantitative fairness metrics, human-subject evaluation modules (e.g., stakeholder surveys, trust indexes), and organizational policy simulation tools. The platform supports plug-and-play evaluation of biomedical LLMs, aggregating technical, social, and ethical fairness indicators. It uses modular architecture enabling integration of media feedback analysis (e.g., misinformation spread), clinical workflow embedding effects, and patient-centered interpretability outcomes.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Define comprehensive fairness and bias metrics embracing technical performance, social perception, and organizational compliance. 2) Assemble datasets and simulation environments capturing clinical workflows and media dissemination scenarios. 3) Implement interfaces for stakeholder engagement data collection. 4) Benchmark multiple clinical LLMs using the platform. 5) Publish open benchmarks and toolkits for community use. 6) Validate improvements in holistic fairness when models are optimized according to platform feedback.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Evaluation of LLM-generated clinical alerts in a smart hospital context combined with simulated media report dissemination and patient trust surveys. Output: Multi-dimensional fairness report highlighting technical accuracy, stakeholder trust levels, and misinformation risks informing model refinement.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If stakeholder engagement data collection is limited, use simulated proxies based on literature-informed social models. If media analysis modules underperform, focus on clinical and organizational fairness assessments initially before expanding."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The assumption that integrating social science-informed metrics and organizational policy simulation with technical fairness measures will yield a holistic and actionable fairness benchmark is plausible but currently under-specified. Clarify and justify how the complex, heterogeneous dimensions—technical, social, communicative, organizational—can be quantitatively harmonized and validated in a single experimental platform without loss of interpretability or introducing conflicting evaluation signals. Providing preliminary evidence or references of successful analogous integrations would strengthen soundness dramatically, ensuring that the foundational premise is robust rather than overly aspirational or vague detection of synergy risks mixing incompatible metrics or biases from each domain unintentionally. Enhancing transparency in the theoretical underpinnings and alignment methodology will bolster confidence in the assumptions' validity across cross-disciplinary boundaries. This is crucial given the novelty and complexity of the proposed multi-faceted approach in clinical LLM fairness benchmarking, which currently reads more as a vision than a demonstrably grounded method slice. Addressing this will make the idea more compelling and scientifically grounded for peer review and adoption contexts beyond incremental technical novelty claims. Target clearer definitions or plans for metric harmonization and conflict resolution mechanisms within the Proposed_Method section specifically to fortify core assumptions evaluation in soundness focus areas (SOU-ASSUMPTION)."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a comprehensive approach, but some critical feasibility challenges require explicit mitigation strategies. The plan depends heavily on acquiring diverse datasets and realistic simulations across clinical workflows, media dissemination, and stakeholder trust assessments. These data sources are often sensitive, heterogeneous, and may suffer from limited availability or quality, particularly stakeholder engagement data and trustworthy media feedback signals. The fallback strategy mentioning proxies is a good start but lacks detail on how these proxies will maintain ecological validity or how the platform will adapt incrementally without full cross-disciplinary data simultaneously. Further, implementing meaningful organizational policy simulations and validating their impact on fairness metrics is a complex systems engineering task that warrants clearer resource, timeline, and technical integration plans. To improve feasibility, concretize the experimental design by prioritizing initial modular pilot studies focused on fewer dimensions (e.g., clinical workflow embedding first), specifying community or institutional partnerships to secure realistic data, and defining validation criteria for stakeholder engagement instruments. This modular phased plan would increase the likelihood of successful execution and adoption while managing scope creep risks. Without these practical elaborations, the ambitious experiment plan risks overextension and difficulty in yielding publishable impactful results inside typical project timelines. Please refine these elements inside the Experiment_Plan section to enhance feasibility and scientific rigor (FEA-EXPERIMENT)."
