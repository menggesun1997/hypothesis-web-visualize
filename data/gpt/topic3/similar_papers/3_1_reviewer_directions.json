    "title": "Stakeholder-Integrated Co-Design Framework for Fair Biomedical LLM Pipelines",
    "Problem_Statement": "While co-design principles for AI pipelines exist, there is a lack of concrete frameworks that embed perspectives from health professionals and patients systematically into the design and deployment of large biomedical LLMs to ensure fairness and interpretability.",
    "Motivation": "This proposal specifically addresses the opportunity to integrate stakeholder engagement frameworks derived from 'health professionals’ perspectives' and 'patient attitudes' with co-design principles (a high-potential innovation opportunity). The novelty lies in formalizing a systematic, iterative co-design methodology involving multi-stakeholder participation along the entire AI development lifecycle for fairness optimization.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce an iterative co-design framework that structures participation from healthcare providers, patients, AI developers, and ethicists through modular workshops, surveys, and collaborative design sessions. Incorporate these inputs into adaptive LLM pipeline components including data curation, bias audit checkpoints, and interpretability layers. The framework features a feedback-driven fairness scoring system that dynamically adjusts model training objectives according to stakeholder priorities. It also integrates scenario-based simulations to evaluate real-world impact of design choices and refinements before deployment.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Identify biomedical LLM application domain (e.g., clinical decision support). 2) Recruit representative stakeholders including clinicians, patients, AI researchers, and bioethicists. 3) Develop co-design curriculum and data collection instruments. 4) Conduct initial workshops to capture fairness concerns and priorities. 5) Implement pipeline adaptations incorporating stakeholder inputs. 6) Run scenario-based model evaluations for fairness (both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback). 7) Iterate the process through multiple development cycles. 8) Compare model fairness and trust metrics against standard AI development pipelines without co-design integration.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Stakeholder feedback revealing concerns about underrepresentation of minority patient symptoms leading to misdiagnoses. Output: Adapted LLM training datasets enhanced with targeted minority subgroup data and updated interpretability modules highlighting symptom relevance, demonstrated to improve fairness metrics and stakeholder trust scores.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If stakeholder engagement participation is limited, use case studies and literature mining to proxy stakeholder concerns. Alternatively, implement a pilot on a smaller scale focusing on only health professionals or patients initially before scaling to include all stakeholders."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan is ambitious and well-structured; however, it lacks concrete feasibility considerations regarding recruitment and sustained engagement of diverse stakeholders, especially patients and ethicists, which could be a bottleneck. More detail is needed on strategies for ensuring representative and sufficient stakeholder participation across multiple iterative cycles, as well as contingency plans for maintaining data quality and engagement throughout. Also, while scenario-based evaluations are promising, the plan should clarify the metrics to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate fairness and trust in a reproducible manner to ensure scientific rigor and comparability with baseline pipelines. Adding more operational detail and pragmatic timeline estimations will strengthen the feasibility claim substantially, helping reviewers and implementers gauge resource and time commitments better. This is critical for a multi-stakeholder co-design framework with iterative development cycles, as real-world constraints may otherwise impede progress or reduce experimental validity if not proactively addressed in the plan documentation and design phase itself. Consider piloting stakeholder recruitment and evaluation metric development early to de-risk the overall methodology before full-scale experimentation begins in Step 5 onward.  This critique targets the \"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\" section explicitly to ensure practical, replicable, and scientifically grounded validation of the framework's effectiveness and adaptability to real-world biomedical LLM pipeline fairness challenges.  Addressing this will markedly improve the likelihood of successful demonstration and adoption of the approach in demanding clinical or medical AI contexts where reproducibility, transparency, stakeholder trust, and rigor are paramount in practice and publication contexts alike.  Thus, successfully resolving this feasibility aspect should be given high priority before scaling or full deployment attempts occur, ensuring the project delivers robust, credible empirical evidence of impact rather than incomplete or anecdotal insights alone as the design evolves operationally over time in medical AI pipeline fairness spaces requiring tight interdisciplinary collaboration and evaluation rigour throughout its lifecycle stages (from data to deployment).  \n\nIn summary: Provide richer detail about recruitment, retention, engagement, and evaluation methodology feasibility in the experimental plan to improve practical viability, measurement validity, and confidence in the framework’s real-world effectiveness over multiple iterative co-design cycles involving heterogeneous biomedical stakeholders and sensitive fairness dimensions simultaneously. This will help clarify how the ambitious workflow turns into workable and convincing scientific experiments beyond conceptual design alone, especially given potential difficulties working with vulnerable populations and complex institutional stakeholders in clinical AI contexts where fairness matters immensely and multi-stakeholder co-design is underexplored but methodologically challenging to operationalize robustly at scale and across development stages simultaneously, leading directly to greater community trust and toward adoption or standardization impact in the future medical AI ecosystem. \n\nNo minor details here: feasibility of experimental execution and method robustness to stakeholder variability are vital bottlenecks requiring clear upfront articulation and mitigation plans in the proposal's core experiment section to avoid the risk of stalled validation or shallow evaluations that might undermine perceived contribution strength and prevent the field from practically benefiting from this promising idea as it matures beyond initial conceptual novelty screening and into impactful, trustworthy biomedical AI fairness innovations. \n\nHence this critique is deemed essential to address immediately for improving confidence in and clarity about the experimental foundation required to convert this inherently interdisciplinary, system-level, iterative co-design fairness framework into demonstrable, publishable, and adoptable scientific contributions aligned with peer review and real-world clinical biomedical AI deployment scrutiny demands for fairness and interpretability with diverse stakeholder input inclusive of patients’ perspectives and professional expertise alike systematically embedded in the pipeline development cycles envisioned here for measurable impact outcomes in practice. \n\nThank you for considering this carefully targeted critique focusing on the critical \"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\" feasibility characterizations, refinement, and risk mitigation enhancements, which are indispensable for strengthening the overall proposal’s viability and credibility in a highly competitive research area where multiple joints must align seamlessly for success beyond mere novelty confirmation. \n\nWe look forward to seeing these aspects clarified and reinforced in revised submissions as they will substantially elevate the proposal’s potential to achieve meaningful biomedical AI fairness advancements practically and reproducibly, advancing progress beyond theory into trustworthy applied innovation benefiting patients and clinicians through collaborative transparent meaningful co-design iterations verified experimentally alongside strong stakeholder trust and fairness quantification metrics evaluated with methodical rigor embedded in the experiment plan details upfront, thus accelerating adoption and positive impact significantly in the biomedical large language model fairness ecosystem (particularly clinical decision support applications targeted here). \n\nShould you require further guidance on operationalizing these suggestions, please don't hesitate to inquire for more tailored support on specific recruitment or metric development strategies applicable to your domain context or stakeholder population characteristics identified in your introductory proposal sections above. \n\nBest wishes as you iterate toward impactful biomedical AI fairness co-design contributions! \n\n[FEA-EXPERIMENT] Thoroughly strengthen experimental feasibility details around stakeholder engagement and fairness metric operationalization to ensure practical, robust validation of the co-design framework’s effectiveness as detailed above targeting the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section for maximum clarity and rigor assurance, thus directly improving confidence in execution and outcomes and ultimately facilitating adoption and real-world impact in biomedical AI fairness pipeline interventions reflecting diverse multi-stakeholder priorities embedded systematically in iterative design cycles throughout the model lifecycle phases envisioned here.\n\n---\n\nIn addition, given the proposal’s novelty assessment as competitive but not distinct, I suggest the following to leverage globally linked concepts to increase impact and possibly novelty: Expand integration of federated learning approaches to enable privacy-preserving, decentralized stakeholder data incorporation during iterative co-design cycles, especially when minority or sensitive patient subgroup data are involved. This could safeguard patient privacy concerns while enriching training data representativeness and fairness adaptations dynamically over multiple stakeholders and sites, while combining with scenario-based simulations to evaluate real-world tradeoffs between fairness, privacy, and interpretability. Such integration could notably bolster both impact and differentiation in the competitive biomedical LLM fairness design landscape, addressing adoption challenges in clinical settings by involving multi-institutional stakeholders collaboratively without data sharing risks, thereby enhancing ethical acceptance and scalability. This suggestion uses the \"federated learning\" and \"patient-centered model of care\" concepts to broaden applicability and novelty with enhanced privacy safeguards alongside fairness and interpretability in co-designed biomedical LLM pipelines, substantially improving the proposal's contribution to trust and adoption in real-world health AI deployments.\n\nCode: [SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION] - targets Title, Proposed_Method, and Motivation sections to amplify novelty and practical impact while mitigating competitive risks through linking federated learning with the stakeholder co-design framework for fairness improvements in large biomedical LLM pipelines, leveraging the globally-linked concepts list.\n\nThank you again for the compelling proposal and opportunity to review it in depth with constructive feedback focused on the most crucial points for immediate refinement and enhancement to maximize downstream impact potential in this crucial medical AI fairness research niche. We encourage you to address the experimental feasibility gap and consider federated learning integration promptly in further proposal iterations to strengthen your idea’s standing toward acceptance and realized benefit for stakeholders globally collaboratively.\n\nBest regards! \n\n[FEA-EXPERIMENT] and [SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION]"
