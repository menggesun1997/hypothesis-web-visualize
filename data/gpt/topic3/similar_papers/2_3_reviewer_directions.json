    "title": "Adaptive Semantic Alignment Layers for Continuous Clinical Data Harmonization",
    "Problem_Statement": "RAG methods struggle with continual alignment to validated clinical standards as medical data and guidelines evolve, limiting long-term reliability and domain adaptation.",
    "Motivation": "Innovates on internal gaps in scalability and continual alignment by proposing adaptive semantic layers inspired by Alzheimer's KG architectures that allow dynamic updating of alignment embeddings as clinical standards update, supporting lifelong learning RAG models in medicine.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop adaptive semantic alignment layers that learn to project retrieved documents and prompt contexts into an evolving semantic space, continuously updated via online KG embeddings linked to authoritative clinical ontologies. Integrate with a RAG system performing incremental updates without full retraining.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use datasets with time-stamped clinical records and updated guidelines. 2. Construct evolving clinical KG with incremental snapshots. 3. Implement adaptive semantic layers with meta-learning techniques. 4. Measure model’s ability to maintain accuracy over updates compared to fixed baselines. 5. Metrics include temporal accuracy stability, hallucination frequency post-updates.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Recommend depression treatments as per latest APA guidelines.\" Output: Up-to-date recommendations reflecting most recent guideline changes without hallucinated outdated info.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If online updates cause instability, fallback to periodic batch updates or meta-learning protocols that isolate updates to semantic layers only."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that adaptive semantic alignment layers integrated with evolving clinical KGs can reliably maintain continual alignment with clinical standards without destabilizing the RAG system. This core assumption requires stronger theoretical justification or preliminary evidence, especially considering the complexity and high stakes of clinical data updates. Clarify assumptions about stability, data drift, and potential conflicts in incremental updates to ensure the approach’s soundness in practice, given medical guideline variability and complexity of semantics involved in clinical ontologies.\n\nStrengthening this by either simulation results or literature evidence about the convergence and robustness of such adaptive alignment layers in highly dynamic clinical environments will help validate the foundational premise here, which is essential to trust the approach and build upon it effectively in later phases of research.\n\nPlease elaborate on error propagation concerns and how the semantic layers will disentangle updated versus legacy representations to avoid semantic drift or catastrophic forgetting within the lifelong learning setup, as these are significant soundness considerations for clinical-grade applications.\n\n(Section targeted: Problem_Statement, Proposed_Method)"

For example, the plan should explicitly address:\n\n- How incremental snapshots of the clinical KG will be constructed and validated against real-world evolving ontologies.\n- Criteria for selecting time intervals and update granularity.\n- Benchmarking against strong baselines beyond fixed semantic layers, such as domain-adaptive continual learning models.\n- Detailed metrics definitions, especially how 'hallucination frequency' will be quantified and linked to update events.\n- Handling and diagnosing failure modes during online updates, beyond the fallback to batch updates.\n\nClarify computational feasibility with realistic dataset sizes and resource requirements, as well as how meta-learning will integrate within the continual learning paradigm and if hyperparameter tuning will be dynamically adapted.\n\nThese clarifications and expansions will reinforce the overall feasibility and scientific rigor of the proposed experiments.\n\n(Section targeted: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)"

For instance, integrating interactive visualization tools that allow clinicians or domain experts to inspect, validate, or guide the adaptive alignment process in real time could enhance trust and facilitate human-in-the-loop updates.\n\nMoreover, exploring pattern recognition techniques to detect semantic shifts or anomalies in retrieved documents could pre-emptively trigger alignment updates, improving system robustness.\n\nIntegrating these globally linked concepts can widen appeal beyond purely technical audiences, helping to address multidisciplinary challenges in clinical AI deployment and augmenting the originality of the work.\n\n(Section targeted: Proposed_Method, Test_Case_Examples)"
