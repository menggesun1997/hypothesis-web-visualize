  "prompt": "You are a world-class research strategist and data synthesizer. Your mission is to analyze a curated set of research papers and their underlying conceptual structure to produce a comprehensive 'Landscape Map' that reveals the current state, critical gaps, and novel opportunities in the field of **Investigating the Impact of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Methods on NLP Task Accuracy in LLMs**.\n\n### Part A: Foundational Literature\nHere are the core similar research papers, which includes the paperId, title and abstract.\n```text\n[{'paper_id': 1, 'title': 'An active inference strategy for prompting reliable responses from large language models in medical practice', 'abstract': 'Continuing advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming medical knowledge access across education, training, and treatment. Early literature cautions their non-determinism, potential for harmful responses, and lack of quality control. To address these issues, we propose a domain-specific, validated dataset for LLM training and an actor–critic prompting protocol grounded in active inference. A Therapist agent generates initial responses to patient queries, while a Supervisor agent refines them. In a blind validation study, experienced cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) therapists evaluated 100 patient queries. For each query, they were given either the LLM’s response or one of two therapist-crafted responses—one appropriate and one deliberately inappropriate—and asked to rate the quality and accuracy of each reply. The LLM often received higher ratings than the appropriate responses, indicating effective alignment with expert standards. This structured approach lays the foundation for safely integrating advanced LLM technology into medical applications.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'A Unified Framework for Alzheimer’s Disease Knowledge Graphs: Architectures, Principles, and Clinical Translation', 'abstract': \"This review paper synthesizes the application of knowledge graphs (KGs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, based on two basic questions, as follows: what types of input data are available to construct these knowledge graphs, and what purpose the knowledge graph is intended to fulfill. We synthesize results from existing works to illustrate how diverse knowledge graph structures behave in different data availability settings with distinct application targets in AD research. By comparative analysis, we define the best methodology practices by data type (literature, structured databases, neuroimaging, and clinical records) and application of interest (drug repurposing, disease classification, mechanism discovery, and clinical decision support). From this analysis, we recommend AD-KG 2.0, which is a new framework that coalesces best practices into a unifying architecture with well-defined decision pathways for implementation. Our key contributions are as follows: (1) a dynamic adaptation mechanism that adapts methodological elements automatically according to both data availability and application objectives, (2) a specialized semantic alignment layer that harmonizes terminologies across biological scales, and (3) a multi-constraint optimization approach for knowledge graph building. The framework accommodates a variety of applications, including drug repurposing, patient stratification for precision medicine, disease progression modeling, and clinical decision support. Our system, with a decision tree structured and pipeline layered architecture, offers research precise directions on how to use knowledge graphs in AD research by aligning methodological choice decisions with respective data availability and application goals. We provide precise component designs and adaptation processes that deliver optimal performance across varying research and clinical settings. We conclude by addressing implementation challenges and future directions for translating knowledge graph technologies from research tool to clinical use, with a specific focus on interpretability, workflow integration, and regulatory matters.\"}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'PodGPT: An audio-augmented large language model for research and education', 'abstract': 'The proliferation of scientific podcasts has generated an extensive repository of audio content, rich in specialized terminology, diverse topics, and expert dialogues. Here, we introduce a computational framework designed to enhance large language models (LLMs) by leveraging this informational content from publicly accessible podcast data across science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medical (STEMM) disciplines. This dataset, comprising over 3, 700 hours of audio content, was transcribed to generate over 42 million text tokens. Our model, PodGPT, integrates this wealth of complex dialogue found in audio podcasts to improve understanding of natural language nuances, cultural contexts, as well as scientific and medical knowledge. PodGPT also employs retrieval augmented generation (RAG) on a vector database built from articles in Creative Commons PubMed Central and <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i> , enhancing STEMM research and education by providing real-time access to emerging scientific literature. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, PodGPT demonstrated an average improvement of 3.51 percentage points over standard open-source benchmarks and 3.81 percentage points when augmented with evidence from the RAG pipeline. Moreover, it showcased an average improvement of 4.06 percentage points in its zero-shot multi-lingual transfer ability, effectively generalizing to different linguistic contexts. By harnessing the untapped potential of podcast content, PodGPT advances natural language processing and conversational AI, offering enhanced capabilities for STEMM research and education.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'RAGing ahead in rheumatology: new language model architectures to tame artificial intelligence', 'abstract': \"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly transforming rheumatology with research on disease detection, monitoring, and outcome prediction through the analysis of large datasets. The advent of generative models and large language models (LLMs) has expanded AI's capabilities, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as question-answering and medical literature synthesis. While NLP has shown promise in identifying rheumatic diseases from electronic health records with high accuracy, LLMs face significant challenges, including hallucinations and a lack of domain-specific knowledge, which limit their reliability in specialized medical fields like rheumatology. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) emerges as a solution to these limitations by integrating LLMs with real-time access to external, domain-specific databases. RAG enhances the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses by retrieving pertinent information during the generation process, reducing hallucinations, and improving the trustworthiness of AI applications. This architecture allows for precise, context-aware outputs and can handle unstructured data effectively. Despite its success in other industries, the application of RAG in medicine, and specifically in rheumatology, remains underexplored. Potential applications in rheumatology include retrieving up-to-date clinical guidelines, summarizing complex patient histories from unstructured data, aiding in patient identification for clinical trials, enhancing pharmacovigilance efforts, and supporting personalized patient education. RAG also offers advantages in data privacy by enabling local data handling and reducing reliance on large, general-purpose models. Future directions involve integrating RAG with fine-tuned, smaller LLMs and exploring multimodal models that can process diverse data types. Challenges such as infrastructure costs, data privacy concerns, and the need for specialized evaluation metrics must be addressed. Nevertheless, RAG presents a promising opportunity to improve AI applications in rheumatology, offering a more precise, accountable, and sustainable approach to integrating advanced language models into clinical practice and research.\"}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Unleashing the potential of prompt engineering for large language models', 'abstract': 'This review explores the role of prompt engineering in unleashing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Prompt engineering is the process of structuring inputs, and it has emerged as a crucial technique for maximizing the utility and accuracy of these models. Both foundational and advanced prompt engineering methodologies-including techniques such as self-consistency, chain of thought, and generated knowledge, which can significantly enhance the performance of models-are explored in this paper. Additionally, the prompt methods for vision language models (VLMs) are examined in detail. Prompt methods are evaluated with subjective and objective metrics, ensuring a robust analysis of their efficacy. Critical to this discussion is the role of prompt engineering in artificial intelligence (AI) security, particularly in terms of defending against adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs. Strategies for minimizing these risks and improving the robustness of models are thoroughly reviewed.

    "title": "Investigating the Impact of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Methods on NLP Task Accuracy in LLMs: A Research Landscape Map",
    "current_research_landscape": "The core problem this research cluster tackles is how to improve the accuracy, reliability, and domain-specific relevance of large language models (LLMs) for specialized NLP tasks—especially in critical domains such as medical practice and behavioral therapy, as evidenced by concepts like language model, cognitive behavioral therapy, and patient queries. The central theme revolves around integrating artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and LLM applications to safely and effectively support healthcare domains like CBT-I. Dominant methodologies include advanced prompting strategies (actor–critic prompting, prompt engineering), integration of domain-specific knowledge bases (knowledge graphs, vector databases), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architectures that enable LLMs to query external, up-to-date, and validated data repositories during generation. This blend enhances the accuracy and contextual relevance of model outputs and addresses challenges like hallucinations and knowledge gaps. The local concept network shows a tight thematic cluster focused on AI applications for patient-centered medical queries, with the language model serving as a key bridging node linking these concepts.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Although RAG boosts accuracy in specialized domains like rheumatology and behavioral therapy, limitations persist in scalability, handling unstructured data effectively, and ensuring continual alignment with validated clinical standards. There is a notable lack of standardized evaluation metrics for RAG effectiveness in applied medical NLP, as well as challenges in infrastructure cost and data privacy/adaptation for local deployment. Furthermore, the approach to prompt engineering and RAG has not fully resolved issues of hallucination and domain-specific fidelity across diverse clinical contexts. The bridge node 'language model' suggests potential to connect improved prompt design with retrieval strategies but this integration remains under-explored and not systematically optimized. External/Novel Gaps: The GPS/global context analysis did not reveal explicit hidden bridges from outside domains in this cluster, indicating an untapped opportunity for cross-disciplinary innovation. For instance, techniques from adjacent fields like cognitive science, human-computer interaction, or precision medicine data integration—used in knowledge graphs or multimodal data fusion—could serve as hidden bridges to enrich RAG frameworks. Applying adaptive semantic alignment layers, as seen in Alzheimer’s knowledge graph architectures, could enhance retrieval relevance and interpretability in medical NLP beyond current RAG uses, addressing real-time clinical decision support needs.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate semantic alignment mechanisms from knowledge graph frameworks (inspired by Alzheimer’s disease KG systems) with retrieval-augmented generation methods applied in behavioral therapy LLMs, to enhance domain adaptation and improve reliability of medical query responses, addressing the internal gaps in domain-specific data harmonization and hallucination reduction.\n\nOpportunity 2: Develop a hybrid prompting-retrieval architecture that tightly couples advanced prompt engineering methods (e.g., actor–critic protocols, chain-of-thought prompting) with real-time, contextually filtered retrieval pipelines to jointly optimize accuracy and interpretability in high-stakes medical NLP tasks, leveraging the language model as a bridge node for combined learning.\n\nOpportunity 3: Explore cross-disciplinary multimodal retrieval-augmented models that combine text, audio, and clinical imaging data—extending concepts from PodGPT’s audio-augmented LLMs—to enrich clinical NLP accuracy and robustness, particularly for patient queries with heterogeneous data sources, thus addressing external gaps on multimodal data integration and retrieval in medicine."
