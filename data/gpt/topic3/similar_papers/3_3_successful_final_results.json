    "title": "Bioethics-Guided Fairness Auditing for Smart Hospital AI Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Fairness auditing of large foundation models in clinical settings is fragmented, with poor integration of organizational, legal, and bioethical dimensions intrinsic to smart hospital workflows and electronic health records (EHRs). This limits model generalizability and acceptance.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the external gap between 'AI ecosystem' and 'care system', this research innovates by embedding bioethical principles and hospital organizational policies directly into fairness auditing tools tailored for smart hospital AI deployment. It goes beyond purely technical bias metrics by fusing institutional constraints, patient care pathways, and legal governance into AI fairness assessments.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a bioethics-guided fairness auditing framework that semantically integrates smart hospital policies, patient rights legislation, and clinical care pathways with foundation model evaluations. The framework uses ontology-based representation of organizational norms linked with EHR data and model predictions to detect fairness violations that are both statistically and ethically significant. It enables real-time auditing coupled with actionable recommendations for model adjustments or deployment constraints within hospital AI ecosystems.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate datasets including EHRs, clinical AI outputs, and hospital policy documents. 2) Formalize ontologies representing bioethical and organizational principles relevant to fairness. 3) Implement an auditing engine coupling statistical fairness metrics with ontology-driven ethical assessments. 4) Test framework on clinical decision-making LLM applications within simulated smart hospital settings. 5) Validate ability to detect fairness lapses that violate both quantitative and qualitative criteria. 6) Collect domain expert feedback on framework utility and impact.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM clinical decision output recommending a treatment biased against patients from a minority demographic. The framework identifies disparity and flags violation of hospital non-discrimination ethics policy. Output: Fairness audit report detailing the bias, conflicting organizational norms, and recommendations for model retraining or deployment restrictions.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If ontology integration proves too complex, employ rule-based proxies of bioethical principles or expert-in-the-loop assessments. Alternatively, focus on modular auditing components that incrementally incorporate organizational aspects into existing statistical audits."

        "title": "Bioethics-Guided Fairness Auditing for Smart Hospital AI Systems with Semantic Conflict Resolution and Scalable Evaluation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Fairness auditing of large foundation models in clinical settings remains fragmented and superficial, lacking an integrated approach that reconciles organizational policies, bioethical norms, and legal mandates within smart hospital workflows and heterogeneous electronic health records (EHRs). This gap undermines model generalizability, raises compliance risks under United States health AI regulations, and hampers clinical trust and adoption.",
        "Motivation": "Despite advances in technical bias metrics, current fairness auditing tools often overlook the complex, and sometimes conflicting, layers of institutional norms embedded in hospital AI systems. This research addresses the competitive challenge by innovating a novel semantic integration mechanism that harmonizes bioethical principles, medical ethics, hospital organizational policies, and relevant US legal frameworks — including non-discrimination and intellectual property law aspects — within a unified auditing framework. This approach transcends prior work by delivering transparent, interpretable, and actionable fairness assessments tailored to high-stakes clinical workflows, enabling compliance with evolving health AI legal standards and enhancing adoption in real-world smart hospitals.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a bioethics-guided fairness auditing framework that semantically integrates heterogeneous normative sources via an ontology-based architecture enhanced with conflict resolution algorithms grounded in defeasible reasoning. The framework encodes and harmonizes bioethical principles, hospital policies, patient rights legislation, and intellectual property constraints into a modular, hierarchical ontology aligned with clinical care pathways and patient demographic EHR data. Statistical fairness metrics are contextually augmented with semantic ethical assessments, where conflicts among norms trigger transparent, rule-based prioritization and rationale generation to support interpretable audit outputs. This method quantifiably adjusts fairness violation scores by weighting or overriding statistical signals based on normative conflicts. For example, if a statistical bias violates both non-discrimination law and hospital ethics, the framework escalates the severity score and generates specific rectification recommendations, explaining their legal and ethical basis. Real-time audit reports feature justifiable decisions reconciling conflicting norms, facilitating trust and regulatory compliance in complex smart hospital environments. To embed United States legal challenges and intellectual property considerations, legal experts collaborate on the formalization of relevant statutes impacting AI model deployment and data use, ensuring the framework's practical applicability and defensibility at scale.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collaborate with clinical, legal, and ethics experts to curate and synthesize a representative subset of EHR datasets, clinical AI outputs, and US-based hospital policy documents, leveraging de-identified synthetic data generation techniques to preserve patient privacy and regulatory compliance. 2) Develop an iterative expert-driven workflow for ontology formalization that captures layered bioethical norms, organizational policies, and legal mandates, validating with interdisciplinary panels to ensure fidelity and practical relevance. 3) Implement a modular auditing engine embedding conflict resolution via defeasible logic to harmonize conflicting norms and transparently adjust fairness metrics. 4) Construct a scalable, configurable simulated smart hospital testbed integrating synthetic patient cohorts, clinical AI decisions, and legal scenarios to evaluate system efficacy under realistic deployment conditions. 5) Execute experiments assessing framework ability to detect, quantify, and explain fairness breaches, comparing outcomes to pure statistical audits to demonstrate interpretability and enhanced ethical reasoning. 6) Gather structured feedback from domain experts on real-time audit report clarity, legal and ethical justifiability, and decision support utility, refining the workflow accordingly. 7) Publish open-source ontology modules and audit engine components for community use and benchmarking.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical LLM recommends a treatment that statistically disadvantages a minority demographic subgroup and also implicates the hospital's strict non-discrimination policy and US healthcare anti-bias laws. The framework detects statistical disparity and identifies conflicts with articulated ethical and legal norms. Through semantic conflict resolution, it escalates the fairness violation severity and generates an audit report detailing these multi-layer violations, underlying ontology reasoning paths, and actionable recommendations such as retraining models with bias mitigation and revising data access policies to align with intellectual property constraints. Output: A comprehensive, transparent fairness audit report integrating statistical metrics with normative ethical and legal assessments, highlighting incurred risks and prescriptive compliance actions to guide hospital AI governance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If ontology-based conflict resolution and legal integration prove overly complex at initial stages, we will adopt a modular approach by first implementing rule-based proxies for key bioethical principles and legal constraints, supplemented by expert-in-the-loop assessments. We will iteratively expand normative scope and sophistication, validate on smaller-scale datasets or synthetic proxies, and progressively modularize the auditing system to enable incremental integration of organizational and legal dimensions, prioritizing interpretability and usability to maintain clinical relevance while managing development complexity."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method relies heavily on ontology-based integration of diverse normative sources (bioethical principles, organizational policies, legislation) with statistical fairness metrics to audit clinical AI models. However, the mechanism for harmonizing heterogeneous and potentially conflicting norms, and how these influence concrete fairness violation detection and actionable recommendations, is not clearly articulated. Clarify the semantic integration process, conflict resolution strategies, and the interpretability of combined ethical and statistical signals to strengthen soundness and usability of the framework, especially for real-time deployment in hospital settings where decisions must be transparent and justifiable. Provide illustrative examples of how ontology-driven ethical assessments quantitatively alter audit outcomes relative to pure statistical audits, to make the mechanism more concrete and convincing in context of clinical workflow constraints and legal risks (e.g., non-discrimination laws). That is critical for building trust and adoption in high-stakes smart hospital AI environments. This improvement will ensure the framework's technical foundation and ethical reasoning are robust, credible, and practically implementable at scale in complex real-world settings, beyond conceptual appeal alone. Targeted elaboration on this core mechanism is thus urgently needed for the work's soundness and clarity to reach premier conference standards (e.g., NeurIPS or ACL).

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan is comprehensive but ambitious, involving curation of multiple datasets (EHRs, clinical AI outputs, policy docs), ontology formalization, engine implementation, and evaluation under simulated hospital settings with expert feedback. However, this plan underestimates the extreme challenges of assembling and harmonizing clinical EHR data with legal and organizational documents while preserving patient privacy and regulatory compliance. Specifically: 1) Accessing sufficiently large and representative EHR datasets with suitable labels and demographic metadata is highly non-trivial; 2) Formalizing ontologies that accurately represent nuanced bioethical and hospital policies requires extensive interdisciplinary collaboration and iterative validation; 3) Simulated hospital settings may lack fidelity to capture real-world deployment complexity. These factors endanger timely and reproducible evaluation. To enhance feasibility, it is important to explicate concrete strategies for data access or synthetic data generation, plans for expert ontology curation workflows, and scalable simulation/testbed environments. Consider modularizing the experimentation focus into tractable intermediate milestones, such as initially auditing a subset of policies or thematic fairness dimensions, balancing methodological rigor with practical constraints. Addressing these feasibility constraints explicitly will increase confidence in deliverability and impact of the research, crucial for acceptance in top-tier venues with strong empirical standards.
