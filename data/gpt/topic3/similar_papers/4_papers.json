    "abstract": "This survey explores the transformative impact of foundation models (FMs) in artificial intelligence, focusing on their integration with federated learning (FL) in biomedical research. Foundation models such as ChatGPT, LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and multimodal patient interactions. The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges, and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs and FL, laying the groundwork for healthcare innovations.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent decision-making (IDM) is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to automate or augment decision processes. Modern IDM paradigms integrate advanced frameworks to enable intelligent agents to make effective and adaptive choices and decompose complex tasks into manageable steps, such as AI agents and high-level reinforcement learning. Recent advances in multimodal foundation-based approaches unify diverse input modalities-such as vision, language, and sensory data-into a cohesive decision-making process. Foundation models (FMs) have become pivotal in science and industry, transforming decision-making and research capabilities. Their large-scale, multimodal data-processing abilities foster adaptability and interdisciplinary breakthroughs across fields such as healthcare, life sciences, and education. This survey examines IDM's evolution, advanced paradigms with FMs and their transformative impact on decision-making across diverse scientific and industrial domains, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in building efficient, adaptive, and ethical decision systems.",

    "abstract": "As financial institutions want openness and accountability in their automated systems, the task of understanding model choices has become more crucial in the field of financial text analysis. In this study, we propose xFiTRNN, a hybrid model that integrates self-attention mechanisms, linearized phrase structure, and a contextualized transformer-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to enhance both model performance and explainability in financial sentence prediction. The model captures subtle contextual information from financial texts while maintaining explainability. xFiTRNN provides transparent, sentence-level insights into predictions by incorporating advanced explainability techniques such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and Anchors. Extensive evaluations on benchmark financial datasets demonstrate that xFiTRNN not only achieves a remarkable prediction performance but also enhances explainability in the financial sector. This work highlights the potential of hybrid transformer-based RNN architectures for fostering more accountable and understandable Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in finance.",

    "abstract": "As the parameter size of large language models (LLMs) continues to expand, there is an urgent need to address the scarcity of high-quality data. In response, existing research has attempted to make a breakthrough by incorporating federated learning (FL) into LLMs. Conversely, considering the outstanding performance of LLMs in task generalization, researchers have also tried applying LLMs within FL to tackle challenges in relevant domains. The complementarity between LLMs and FL has already ignited widespread research interest. In this review, we aim to deeply explore the integration of LLMs and FL. We propose a research framework dividing the fusion of LLMs and FL into three parts: the combination of LLM sub-technologies with FL, the integration of FL sub-technologies with LLMs, and the overall merger of LLMs and FL. We first provide a comprehensive review of the current state of research in the domain of LLMs combined with FL, including their typical applications, integration advantages, challenges faced, and future directions for resolution. Subsequently, we discuss the practical applications of the combination of LLMs and FL in critical scenarios such as healthcare, finance, and education and provide new perspectives and insights into future research directions for LLMs and FL.",

    "title": "Generative spatial artificial intelligence for sustainable smart cities: A pioneering large flow model for urban digital twin",
    "year": 2025,
    "citationCount": 13,
    "fieldCitationRatio": NaN,
    "abstract": "Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies-such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks-to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows-namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity-critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of deep learning (DL) technology, DL-based intrusion detection models have emerged as a focal point of research within the domain of cybersecurity. This paper provides an overview of the datasets frequently utilized in the research. This article presents an overview of the widely utilized datasets in the research, establishing a basis for future investigation and analysis. The text subsequently summarizes the prevalent data preprocessing methods and feature engineering techniques utilized in intrusion detection. Following this, it provides a review of seven deep learning-based intrusion detection models, namely, deep autoencoders, deep belief networks, deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, generative adversarial networks, and transformers. Each model is examined from various dimensions, highlighting their unique architectures and applications within the context of cybersecurity. Furthermore, this paper broadens its scope to include intrusion detection techniques facilitated by the following two large-scale predictive models: the BERT series and the GPT series. These models, leveraging the power of transformers and attention mechanisms, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and processing sequential data. In light of these findings, this paper concludes with a prospective outlook on future research directions. Four key areas have been identified for further research. By addressing these issues and advancing research in the aforementioned areas, this paper envisions a future in which DL-based intrusion detection systems are not only more accurate and efficient but also better aligned with the dynamic and evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats.",

    "abstract": "Large-language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical note information extraction, but deployment challenges include high computational costs and privacy concerns. We used synthetic data distillation to fine-tune smaller, open-source LLMs to achieve performance comparable to larger models while enabling local hardware deployment or reduced cloud costs. Using Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, we generated synthetic question-answer training pairs to fine-tune smaller Llama models. We evaluated performance across three tasks: synthetic clinical trial criteria, the i2b2 2018 Clinical Trial Eligibility Challenge, and apixaban trial criteria questions. The 8B-parameter model achieved high accuracy across all tasks and sometimes outperformed the 70B-Instruct teacher model. Fine-tuning with only the most challenging questions still improved performance, demonstrating the value of targeted training. Results from 3B- and 1B-parameter models showed a clear size-performance tradeoff. This work demonstrates synthetic data distillation’s potential for enabling scalable clinical information extraction.",

    "abstract": "In the complex and multidimensional field of medicine, multimodal data are prevalent and crucial for informed clinical decisions. Multimodal data span a broad spectrum of data types, including medical images (eg, MRI and CT scans), time-series data (eg, sensor data from wearable devices and electronic health records), audio recordings (eg, heart and respiratory sounds and patient interviews), text (eg, clinical notes and research articles), videos (eg, surgical procedures), and omics data (eg, genomics and proteomics). While advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new applications for knowledge retrieval and processing in the medical field, most LLMs remain limited to processing unimodal data, typically text-based content, and often overlook the importance of integrating the diverse data modalities encountered in clinical practice. This paper aims to present a detailed, practical, and solution-oriented perspective on the use of multimodal LLMs (M-LLMs) in the medical field. Our investigation spanned M-LLM foundational principles, current and potential applications, technical and ethical challenges, and future research directions. By connecting these elements, we aimed to provide a comprehensive framework that links diverse aspects of M-LLMs, offering a unified vision for their future in health care. This approach aims to guide both future research and practical implementations of M-LLMs in health care, positioning them as a paradigm shift toward integrated, multimodal data-driven medical practice. We anticipate that this work will spark further discussion and inspire the development of innovative approaches in the next generation of medical M-LLM systems.",

    "abstract": "Critical National Infrastructures (CNIs)-including energy grids, water systems, transportation networks, and communication frameworks-are essential to modern society yet face escalating cybersecurity threats. This review paper comprehensively analyzes AI-driven approaches for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP). We begin by examining the reliability of CNIs and introduce established benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) within cybersecurity contexts. Next, we explore core cybersecurity issues, focusing on trust, privacy, resilience, and securability in these vital systems. Building on this foundation, we assess the role of Generative AI and LLMs in enhancing CIP and present insights on applying Agentic AI for proactive defense mechanisms. Finally, we outline future directions to guide the integration of advanced AI methodologies into protecting critical infrastructures. Our paper provides a strategic roadmap for researchers and practitioners committed to fortifying national infrastructures against emerging cyber threats through this synthesis of current challenges, benchmarking strategies, and innovative AI applications.",
