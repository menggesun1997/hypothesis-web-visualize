        "title": "Federated Synthetic Data Distillation for Privacy-Aware Intrusion Detection",
        "Problem_Statement": "Deploying large-scale LLMs for intrusion detection in privacy-sensitive environments is hindered by data scarcity, heterogeneity, and privacy concerns. Conventional federated learning faces communication inefficiencies and struggles with non-IID data distributions, while data distillation has yet to be fully leveraged in this context.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses internal gaps around privacy, data scarcity, and federated learning limitations, and exploits the hidden bridge between clinical data distillation and cybersecurity datasets, by integrating privacy-preserving synthetic data distillation into federated intrusion detection training frameworks for resource-constrained edge devices.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel framework combining federated learning with locally generated synthetic data distillation. Each client distills its sensitive local intrusion detection dataset into a compressed, privacy-preserving synthetic dataset via generative models guided by differential privacy. These synthetic datasets are communicated instead of raw data or gradients, improving communication efficiency and privacy. The central server aggregates distilled synthetic data summaries to train a global intrusion detection model. The approach incorporates adaptability to heterogeneous client distributions and models parameter size constraints through lightweight hybrid transformer-RNN architectures tailored for edge deployment.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect heterogeneous intrusion detection datasets mimicking distributed environments, including privacy-sensitive data. 2) Develop synthetic data distillation modules with differential privacy guarantees. 3) Implement federated learning framework exchanging distilled synthetic data. 4) Design lightweight hybrid transformer-RNN models for clients and server. 5) Evaluate on benchmarks for intrusion detection (e.g., NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017) comparing detection accuracy, privacy leakage, communication cost, and model size metrics against classical federated learning and centralized baselines. 6) Analyze robustness to non-IID client data and scalability to number of clients.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Local network traffic logs on an edge client with sensitive information. Distilled synthetic dataset uses generative modeling to produce anonymized traffic patterns. Output: Federatedly trained intrusion detection model with high detection accuracy and minimal privacy compromise, able to flag malicious traffic patterns across distributed nodes, maintaining real-time feasibility on resource-constrained devices.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If synthetic data distillation causes degradation in detection performance, fallback includes hybrid schemes sending distilled gradient summaries combined with data augmentation to improve synthetic data quality. Alternatively, explore compressed model updates with secure aggregation to enhance privacy. Additional debugging involves validating privacy budgets and adjusting generative model complexity."

        "title": "Multimodal Clinical and Cybersecurity Data Fusion for Explainable Intrusion Detection",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current intrusion detection systems rely largely on textual or network traffic data, limiting robustness and transparency. Meanwhile, healthcare multimodal LLMs integrate textual, imaging, and sensor data for enhanced interpretability and accuracy, but such fusion techniques are unexplored in cybersecurity, especially for privacy-sensitive real-time applications.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses internal gaps of explainability and robustness in intrusion detection models by leveraging cross-domain insights from healthcare multimodal LLMs. This exploits the hidden bridge linking multimodal clinical information extraction with cybersecurity data streams, pioneering transparent, trustworthy detection in complex environments.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel multimodal LLM architecture that integrates network traffic logs (textual), system call graphs (graph-structured data), and contextual metadata (temporal sensor signals or binary instrumentation data) for intrusion detection. The architecture employs transformer-based fusion layers combined with graph neural networks and RNNs to capture heterogeneous modalities. An attention-based explainability module highlights key features influencing decisions, enabling transparent root-cause analysis. Privacy-aware embedding mechanisms ensure sensitive metadata is processed securely.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble a multimodal intrusion detection dataset incorporating textual logs, system call graphs, and related sensor metadata using public sources and simulated environments. 2) Implement the hybrid transformer-GNN-RNN architecture with attention explainability. 3) Train and validate on intrusion detection benchmarks augmented with multimodal inputs. 4) Benchmark against unimodal state-of-the-art models measuring detection accuracy, robustness under adversarial conditions, and explainability metrics (fidelity, sparsity). 5) Conduct user studies with cybersecurity analysts evaluating utility of explanations. 6) Test privacy guarantees and latency for real-time deployment.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A suspicious network sessionâ€™s textual log combined with its corresponding system call graph and CPU sensor readings. Output: Intrusion detection label (benign/malicious), accompanied by an explanation highlighting that anomalous system calls and temporal sensor spikes were decisive factors, thus enabling informed response.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If fusion leads to performance bottlenecks, reduce modalities or adopt late fusion with modality-specific models. Alternatively, increase model sparsity or pruning to reduce complexity. For explainability, fallback to simpler attention maps or post-hoc interpretable methods like LIME or SHAP while refining multimodal integration."

        "title": "Lightweight Hybrid Transformer-RNNs with Synthetic Data Distillation for IoT NLP Tasks",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large LLMs struggle with parameter size and computational demands, obstructing deployment on resource-constrained IoT and edge devices, especially for clinical NLP tasks needing reliable real-time inference. Synthetic data distillation techniques have primarily been demonstrated in clinical settings but not adapted for lightweight hybrid architectures suitable for IoT infrastructure protection domains.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses parameter size constraints and computational efficiency gaps in critical infrastructure protection by adapting synthetic data distillation and hybrid transformers-RNN innovations from clinical NLP to real-time, limited-resource IoT environments, thus bridging cross-domain advances into operational security contexts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a parameter-efficient neural architecture combining lightweight transformers with gated RNN layers, optimized jointly with synthetic data distillation from clinical NLP datasets. The model undergoes knowledge distillation on synthetic clinical data generated to simulate diverse IoT NLP scenarios (e.g., anomaly logs, incident reports). Model compression includes pruning, quantization, and architecture search tailored for specific IoT hardware constraints. The approach includes domain adaptation to cybersecurity logs ensuring transferability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect clinical NLP datasets and generate synthetic distillation datasets relevant for IoT domains. 2) Develop hybrid transformer-RNN architecture tuned for low-resource edge hardware (e.g., ARM Cortex-M). 3) Apply knowledge distillation on synthetic datasets to train compact models. 4) Evaluate on IoT-related NLP tasks such as log anomaly detection, alert classification, comparing to baseline large LLMs and purely RNN/transformer models. 5) Measure runtime, accuracy, and reliability metrics under compute and memory constraints. 6) Deploy prototype on IoT device simulators with real-time benchmarks.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An edge IoT device log excerpt describing unusual sensor readings in textual format. Output: A lightweight model outputting classification (normal/anomaly) with confidence score suitable for on-device real-time alert triggering, maintaining 95% of large LLM performance with 90% fewer parameters and under 100ms inference time.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If model compression reduces accuracy unacceptably, explore federated ensemble methods combining multiple lightweight learners. Alternatively, incrementally increase model complexity or employ hardware accelerators. Investigate progressive synthetic data augmentation to improve distillation quality."
