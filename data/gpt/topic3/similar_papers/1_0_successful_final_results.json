    "title": "Federated Clinical-Power Dispatch LLM Tuning for Privacy and Robustness",
    "Problem_Statement": "Integrating LLMs into domains like power dispatch and biomedical NLP faces challenges in privacy, efficiency, and robustness when fine-tuning on sensitive, heterogeneous data from multiple sources. Traditional centralized fine-tuning incurs privacy risks and inefficiencies.",
    "Motivation": "This idea directly addresses internal gaps (a) scalability, (c) privacy in deployment, and external gap leveraging federated learning methods combined with semantic knowledge tuning to enable decentralized, privacy-preserving LLM adaptation for domain-specific tasks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a federated learning framework where multiple domain entities (e.g., hospitals, power plants) collaboratively train an LLM. The method incorporates semantic knowledge tuning to infuse domain expertise efficiently. Model updates are aggregated with differential privacy guarantees to protect sensitive data. A multi-task objective balances general language understanding with domain-specific task accuracy and robustness.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect federated datasets from biomedical text and power dispatch logs. 2. Use a pre-trained LLM as base. 3. Implement federated semantic knowledge tuning (FedSKT). 4. Baselines: centralized fine-tuning and vanilla federated tuning without knowledge injection. 5. Evaluate on domain task accuracy, robustness under domain shifts, privacy leakage metrics, and training efficiency.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Power dispatch instruction text with embedded sensor data references. Expected Output: Accurate, robust task-relevant summary with no sensitive info leakage. Input: Clinical notes for diagnosis prediction. Expected Output: High-accuracy prediction maintaining patient data privacy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated semantic tuning struggles with convergence, fallback to hybrid semi-federated approaches where smaller sub-models are tuned locally and ensembled. Alternatively, reduce model size or incorporate knowledge distillation to improve stability."

        "title": "Federated Semantic-Graph Enhanced LLM Tuning with Robustness and Privacy Guarantees for Cyber-Physical Clinical and Power Systems",
        "Problem_Statement": "Deploying large language models (LLMs) tailored for sensitive cyber-physical domains such as clinical NLP and power dispatch presents intertwined challenges: ensuring user privacy over heterogeneous, distributed datasets; maintaining model robustness against adversarial and domain shifts; and preserving system security amid cyber-physical threats. Existing federated fine-tuning approaches inadequately specify how to integrate domain semantic knowledge securely and robustly while addressing trustworthiness and communication efficiency concerns critical in these multi-stakeholder environments.",
        "Motivation": "While federated learning enables decentralized LLM adaptation for privacy preservation, current methods often treat semantic knowledge injection as a black-box step, lacking transparent mechanisms to infuse domain expertise cohesively across nodes. Furthermore, scalable, trustworthy deployment in cyber-physical settings demands robustness to adversarial manipulations and secure communication protocols to defend against cyber threats. This research aims to bridge these gaps by combining federated semantic knowledge tuning with graph-based data modeling and advanced secure computation techniques â€” establishing a novel, rigorous framework that not only respects privacy and heterogeneity but is verifiably robust and cybersecure. Thus, it advances beyond incremental federated tuning by holistically addressing interdisciplinary challenges critical for real-world clinical and power system applications.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a Federated Semantic-Graph Enhanced LLM Tuning framework (FedSGT) that explicitly models inter-entity relationships as a dynamic graph to leverage graph data management principles, improving communication efficiency and domain knowledge dissemination. Semantic knowledge is encoded via modular, disentangled adapters representing domain expertise, which are updated locally with semantic constraints and fused globally through a graph-structured aggregation algorithm. Privacy is rigorously ensured using differential privacy combined with secure multi-party computation (SMPC) protocols during parameter exchanges, preventing data leakage even under adversarial inference attacks. To guarantee robustness, we integrate adversarial training against perturbations tailored for cyber-physical data distributions and implement formal robust optimization guarantees via randomized smoothing for model outputs. Multi-task learning is realized with a composite objective balancing: (a) general semantic consistency losses from language pretraining, (b) domain-specific supervised losses to capture clinical/power task accuracy, and (c) robustness and privacy regularizers. The training loop operationalizes these losses with adaptive weight balancing, dynamically adjusted through a trustworthiness-aware scheduler that prioritizes privacy or robustness depending on real-time threat assessments. This comprehensive architecture provides detailed algorithmic specifications for all components to maximize reproducibility and impact.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate federated graph-structured datasets integrating clinical notes from multiple hospitals and power dispatch logs from geographically distributed plants, annotating inter-entity relationships. 2. Initialize from a publicly available large pre-trained LLM and construct modular semantic adapters encoding expert-crafted ontologies and domain rules. 3. Develop and implement the FedSGT architecture with explicit graph-based parameter aggregation combined with SMPC protocols for secure federated updates. 4. Integrate adversarial robustness components including synthetic adversarial data generation and randomized smoothing during training. 5. Baselines include: (a) centralized fine-tuning, (b) standard federated tuning without semantic or graph components, (c) federated tuning with semantic adapters but no graph or robustness modules. 6. Evaluate extensively on: domain task performance (accuracy, F1), privacy leakage quantification (membership inference attacks), adversarial robustness metrics, communication efficiency, and deployment simulations mimicking cyber-physical threat models. 7. Perform ablations on graph topology influence, adapter mechanisms, and scheduler efficacy.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "- Input: Power dispatch command logs with sensor metadata linked via graph edges; output should yield stable scheduling decisions robust to adversarial signal noise, with zero leakage of sensor raw data. - Input: Federated clinical notes streams annotated with patient relationships; output: privacy-preserving, interpretable diagnosis predictions resilient to membership inference and adversarial textual manipulation. - Realistic cyber-physical attack scenario simulation: adversary attempts to inject corrupted model updates; system maintains privacy and detection mechanisms prevent degradation of aggregate model quality.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If graph-based aggregation or SMPC integration results in prohibitive computational overhead or convergence issues, pivot to a hierarchical federated tuning approach clustering entities by similarity to localize communication and simplify privacy constraints. Alternatively, apply knowledge distillation to smaller robust sub-models to reduce overhead while preserving semantic and robustness gains. For instabilities in multi-task balancing, employ gradient surgery or dynamic loss weighting schemes refined via meta-learning techniques to stabilize training."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines using federated semantic knowledge tuning (FedSKT) with differential privacy and a multi-task objective, but leaves unclear the concrete integration mechanism of semantic knowledge tuning within federated updates. For instance, how semantic knowledge is explicitly encoded, shared, or updated locally versus globally is ambiguous. Further, the plan lacks clarity on how domain expertise is efficiently infused without breaching privacy or inducing instability. To strengthen soundness, the authors should provide detailed architectural or algorithmic descriptions clarifying this mechanism, specify the exact federated optimization and privacy-preserving algorithms employed, and explain how multi-task balancing is operationalized in training steps or loss functions. This will solidify the conceptual grounding and reproducibility of the method, preventing vague black-box interpretations and enabling clearer impact assessment of the semantic knowledge injection in the federated setting within these sensitive domains (biomedical, power dispatch)."

For example, integrating adversarial robustness guarantees or secure multi-party computation protocols could differentiate and deepen the impact. Leveraging graph data management techniques to model inter-entity relationships in federated learning might also enhance communication efficiency and robustness. Incorporating these dimensions would amplify novelty and impact by addressing practical deployment challenges and emerging threats in sensitive cyber-physical domains like power dispatch and clinical NLP, elevating the contribution beyond incremental federated semantic tuning frameworks."
