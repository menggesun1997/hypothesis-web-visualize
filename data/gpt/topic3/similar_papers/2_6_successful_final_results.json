        "title": "Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Knowledge Graph Integration for Privacy-Preserving Local Clinical NLP",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for clinical NLP face fundamental challenges in balancing data privacy, model adaptability, and performance consistency when deployed across heterogeneous local clinical environments. Conventional centralized approaches risk patient data leakage and often fail to adapt effectively to inter-site distribution shifts, inhibiting widespread and trustworthy clinical NLP applications.",
        "Motivation": "To address the competitiveness gap and surpass existing solutions, this proposal innovates by designing a federated RAG architecture that distinctly integrates decentralized knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval with generation across local clinical sites. It rigorously ensures privacy preservation through advanced encrypted model update protocols and differential privacy mechanisms. Leveraging domain-specific knowledge graphs enhances retrieval relevance and generation coherence amid heterogeneous clinical data distributions, thus overcoming standard federated RAG limitations and enabling scalable, adaptive, and clinically accurate NLP model deployment.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel federated learning framework where each clinical site locally constructs and updates domain-specific knowledge graphs from electronic health records and multi-dimensional clinical data (e.g., imaging metadata), fed into a convolutional neural network-based retriever aligned with a gated recurrent unit-powered generator with prompt-engineering. Retrieval indices remain strictly local, enriched by the knowledge graph embeddings to capture structured medical semantics. Clients communicate encrypted model weight updates, using secure aggregation combined with differential privacy guarantees, to a central server that aggregates heterogeneous updates via a weighted, cluster-based federated averaging schema, improving global model consistency while respecting distributional shifts.\n\nPrompt-engineering is operationalized locally through adaptive prompt tuning that evolves over federated rounds, minimizing communication overhead by exchanging only compact prompt parameter updates. The knowledge graph assists in synchronizing retrieval and generation by grounding generated outputs in shared medical ontologies, enhancing cross-client coherence. This approach simultaneously advances privacy, cross-site synergy, and clinical accuracy by tightly coupling structured domain knowledge, advanced federated protocols, and prompt adaptation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset Selection: Curate and preprocess multiple heterogeneous local clinical datasets representing diverse modalities (e.g., behavioral therapy notes, ICU records, multi-dimensional images) with annotated clinical NLP tasks, ensuring demographic and modality-based distribution shifts.\n2. Simulation Environment: Develop a federated simulation with configurable client numbers, communication bandwidth, and privacy budgets to reflect realistic clinical deployment scenarios.\n3. System Implementation: Build the federated RAG architecture incorporating knowledge graphs, CNN-based retrievers, GRU-based generators, secure aggregation, and differential privacy mechanisms.\n4. Experimental Controls: Compare against centralized training, non-knowledge-graph federated RAG, and baseline federated models without differential privacy.\n5. Metrics Definition and Measurement: Define clinical accuracy as F1-score and domain-specific precision on NLP tasks; privacy leakage risk quantified via epsilon-differential privacy parameters and membership inference attack resistance; adaptation speed measured by communication rounds and wall-clock convergence time to target accuracy.\n6. Ablation Studies: Evaluate effects of knowledge graph integration, prompt-engineering adaptation frequency, number of clients, and fallback strategies involving synthetic data augmentation.\n7. Analyze communication overhead, model convergence behavior, and privacy-performance tradeoffs to inform feasibility and deployment guidelines.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A clinical query from a local behavioral therapy clinic regarding patient-specific treatment history involving multi-modal notes and imaging.\nOutput: A precise, contextually coherent response generated by the locally fine-tuned model leveraging the integrated knowledge graph, encompassing insights from both local datasets and federated knowledge, without exposing raw patient data externally.\nAdditional: Evaluation includes confirming no leakage through privacy audits and measuring prompt adaptation impact on generation relevance across federated rounds.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated training results in significant performance degradation or convergence instability, we will implement a hybrid approach that selectively shares anonymized knowledge graph embeddings or synthetic patient data generated via differentially private generative models. This approach balances privacy with enriched global knowledge for clients with limited data. Additionally, prompt-engineering adaptation frequency and communication payloads will be dynamically tuned to reduce overhead and improve convergence based on ablation study insights."
