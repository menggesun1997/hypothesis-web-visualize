    "title": "Federated Clinical-Power Dispatch LLM Tuning for Privacy and Robustness",
    "Problem_Statement": "Integrating LLMs into domains like power dispatch and biomedical NLP faces challenges in privacy, efficiency, and robustness when fine-tuning on sensitive, heterogeneous data from multiple sources. Traditional centralized fine-tuning incurs privacy risks and inefficiencies.",
    "Motivation": "This idea directly addresses internal gaps (a) scalability, (c) privacy in deployment, and external gap leveraging federated learning methods combined with semantic knowledge tuning to enable decentralized, privacy-preserving LLM adaptation for domain-specific tasks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a federated learning framework where multiple domain entities (e.g., hospitals, power plants) collaboratively train an LLM. The method incorporates semantic knowledge tuning to infuse domain expertise efficiently. Model updates are aggregated with differential privacy guarantees to protect sensitive data. A multi-task objective balances general language understanding with domain-specific task accuracy and robustness.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect federated datasets from biomedical text and power dispatch logs. 2. Use a pre-trained LLM as base. 3. Implement federated semantic knowledge tuning (FedSKT). 4. Baselines: centralized fine-tuning and vanilla federated tuning without knowledge injection. 5. Evaluate on domain task accuracy, robustness under domain shifts, privacy leakage metrics, and training efficiency.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Power dispatch instruction text with embedded sensor data references. Expected Output: Accurate, robust task-relevant summary with no sensitive info leakage. Input: Clinical notes for diagnosis prediction. Expected Output: High-accuracy prediction maintaining patient data privacy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated semantic tuning struggles with convergence, fallback to hybrid semi-federated approaches where smaller sub-models are tuned locally and ensembled. Alternatively, reduce model size or incorporate knowledge distillation to improve stability."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines using federated semantic knowledge tuning (FedSKT) with differential privacy and a multi-task objective, but leaves unclear the concrete integration mechanism of semantic knowledge tuning within federated updates. For instance, how semantic knowledge is explicitly encoded, shared, or updated locally versus globally is ambiguous. Further, the plan lacks clarity on how domain expertise is efficiently infused without breaching privacy or inducing instability. To strengthen soundness, the authors should provide detailed architectural or algorithmic descriptions clarifying this mechanism, specify the exact federated optimization and privacy-preserving algorithms employed, and explain how multi-task balancing is operationalized in training steps or loss functions. This will solidify the conceptual grounding and reproducibility of the method, preventing vague black-box interpretations and enabling clearer impact assessment of the semantic knowledge injection in the federated setting within these sensitive domains (biomedical, power dispatch)."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the 'NOV-COMPETITIVE' rating and the already strong connections among federated learning, LLM tuning, privacy, and domain adaptation, the idea would substantially benefit from explicitly incorporating robust trustworthiness aspects related to cybersecurity and cyber-physical systems, as indicated in the globally-linked concepts. For example, integrating adversarial robustness guarantees or secure multi-party computation protocols could differentiate and deepen the impact. Leveraging graph data management techniques to model inter-entity relationships in federated learning might also enhance communication efficiency and robustness. Incorporating these dimensions would amplify novelty and impact by addressing practical deployment challenges and emerging threats in sensitive cyber-physical domains like power dispatch and clinical NLP, elevating the contribution beyond incremental federated semantic tuning frameworks."
