    "title": "Integrated Multimodal Domain Fusion for Robust LLM Interpretability in Safety-Critical Domains",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs face robustness and interpretability challenges when integrating diverse multimodal data sources (text, sensor data, images) in complex domains such as power systems or healthcare.",
    "Motivation": "Targets internal gap (b) around integration of multimodal data without sacrificing interpretability or robustness by innovatively fusing heterogeneous domain knowledge sources into LLMs with transparent intermediate reasoning modules inspired from clinical decision support systems.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an architecture combining LLM textual reasoning layers with structured sensor and image modality embeddings through a multi-headed attention fusion mechanism. Include an interpretable reasoning trace module providing explainable decision rationales via domain-specialized rule extraction before final output generation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble multimodal datasets in power dispatch and clinical diagnostic domains. 2. Train fusion LLM model with attention-based cross-modal integration. 3. Design and test the reasoning trace explainer. 4. Baselines: unimodal LLMs and black-box multimodal fusion models. 5. Metrics: task accuracy, robustness to noisy inputs, interpretability scores via user studies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Power system text alerts plus real-time sensor readings. Output: Action recommendation with detailed explanation citing sensor anomalies. Input: Clinical text and imaging data question. Output: Diagnosis prediction with transparent reasoning path.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If the attention fusion hampers training, switch to separate modality experts combined via late fusion. Alternatively, simplify explainer module to post-hoc attribution techniques or prototype-based explanations."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method, while ambitious in integrating multimodal data via multi-headed attention fusion and interpretable reasoning traces, lacks detailed clarity on how robustness and interpretability are concretely balanced or quantified within the architecture. For example, it is unclear how domain-specialized rule extraction modules are designed or trained, or how intermediate reasoning traces are validated. Providing a more precise architectural workflow, highlighting how each module contributes to robustness against noisy inputs and transparency for end users, would improve soundness and reproducibility of the approach. Consider including schematic diagrams or pseudocode to elucidate the fusion and explainer interactions, along with theoretical or empirical justifications for chosen mechanisms over strong baseline alternatives in the literature (e.g., prototype-based explanation methods or attention-only fusion). This clarity is essential for the community to assess and build upon the approach confidently and may prevent issues during experimentation or deployment in safety-critical environments like power systems or healthcare.

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is comprehensive but ambitious and leaves some practical feasibility questions open. For instance, the data collection/assembly step across two very different domains (power dispatch and clinical diagnostics) requires access to diverse, potentially sensitive, and high-quality multimodal datasets with synchronized sensor-text-image modalities, which may be challenging and time-consuming. Additionally, robustness testing via noisy inputs and interpretability evaluation via user studies are outlined but need more fleshing out on experimental protocols, e.g., what noise models will be used? How will interpretability scores be quantified and validated with real domain experts? Budgeting for iterative model training and fallback adaptations also seems optimistic given the multi-domain scope and complexity of the architecture. To improve feasibility, the authors should consider focusing on a single domain first, ensure access to domain partners and appropriate datasets up front, and define more precise, operationalized interpretability and robustness metrics. Clarifying timelines and resource requirements related to each experimental step would strengthen the plan's credibility and increase likelihood of successful execution.
