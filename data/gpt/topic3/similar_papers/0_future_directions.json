        "Problem_Statement": "Medical NLP applications require high accuracy in interpreting domain-specific data like radiology reports and patient conversations, but face severe privacy constraints that inhibit centralized training. Current LLMs underperform on these specialized tasks, and deploying models in local secure networks remains a challenge due to lack of efficient frameworks.",
        "Motivation": "This addresses the external gap identified between 'natural language processing' and 'local network' by integrating federated learning with efficient transfer learning, enabling privacy-preserving training on sensitive healthcare NLP tasks. It also responds to the internal gap of insufficient real-world validation and adoption in clinical environments.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a federated transfer learning framework where multiple healthcare institutions collaboratively train a shared base LLM without sharing raw data. The model incorporates a multimodal architecture that integrates text inputs (clinical notes) and related medical images (radiology scans) to enhance context understanding. Transfer learning adapts the centralized pretrained LLM to domain-specific knowledge at the client level. Advanced privacy-preserving techniques (differential privacy and secure aggregation) ensure data confidentiality. The model is optimized for deployment in constrained local network setups.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect distributed datasets of radiology reports paired with imaging from multiple hospitals.\n2. Pretrain a base LLM (e.g., GPT architecture) on generic medical corpora.\n3. Implement federated transfer learning framework enabling client-side adaptation.\n4. Integrate image embeddings from a vision backbone with textual embeddings in a multimodal fusion layer.\n5. Evaluate performance on domain-specific tasks: radiological anatomy recognition and patient interaction QA.\n6. Compare with centralized training and existing prompt-engineering based baselines.\n7. Assess privacy guarantees quantitatively (privacy budget) and qualitatively (regulatory compliance).",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A radiology report describing CT scan findings regarding lung nodule characteristics.\nExpected Output: Accurate extraction and classification of nodule features, with confidence scores and an explanation linking to imaging features.

Alternatively, investigate low-rank adapters for efficient local fine-tuning. For multimodal fusion, test intermediate representation concatenation vs cross-attention mechanisms to improve integration."
