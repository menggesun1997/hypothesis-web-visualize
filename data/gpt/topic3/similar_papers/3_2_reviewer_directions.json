    "title": "Science Journalism-Informed Transparency Layers for Biomedical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Biomedical AI ecosystems lack robust transparency and bias reporting mechanisms that draw on communication/media insights, resulting in insufficient public trust and ethical stewardship, especially in high-stakes clinical contexts.",
    "Motivation": "This project targets the external gap connecting 'artificial general intelligence' and 'AI ecosystem' to communication and media studies. The novelty is in fusing science journalism quality frameworks into AI model transparency architectures, enhancing public comprehension and trust while mitigating bias obfuscation in biomedical LLMs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design transparency layers inspired by best practices in science journalism, embedding narrative clarity, source credibility tagging, and uncertainty communication into LLM output explanations. Develop a bias reporting standard whose format and dissemination emulate high-quality science journalism techniques, including contextualizing findings with analogies, impact narratives, and expert quotes. Integrate these layers into biomedical AI interfaces enabling clinicians and patients to access layered explanations co-created with communication specialists.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Analyze exemplary science journalism pieces to extract narrative and transparency principles. 2) Build explanation templates for biomedical LLM outputs incorporating these principles. 3) Implement bias reporting protocols structured as digestible, multi-level reports (technical to layman). 4) Conduct user studies with medical professionals and patient groups to assess interpretability, trust, and perceived fairness. 5) Compare with standard explanation techniques using metrics such as comprehension scores, trust ratings, and bias detection accuracy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM-generated clinical recommendation for treatment with known subgroup efficacy disparities. Output: Accompanying transparency layer explaining recommendation rationale with lay-friendly narratives highlighting known biases, uncertainties, and expert opinions in accessible language improving user understanding and trust.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If specialized transparency layers are too complex for real-time system integration, fall back to generating post-hoc science journalism-style reports. Alternatively, employ automated summarization techniques constrained by audience expertise level to approximate this effect."

          "feedback_content": "While the experiment plan is thoughtfully staged and includes relevant user studies, it lacks detailed consideration of the potential challenges in recruiting diverse patient groups and ensuring representative clinician participation, which are crucial for validating trust and fairness perceptions. Additionally, the plan should specify criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of transparency layers across varying clinical contexts and complexity levels. Incorporating iterative prototyping with active feedback loops from communication specialists could further ensure practical integration and usability before broader deployment. Clarifying these methodological details will enhance overall feasibility and scientific rigor of the evaluation phase, ensuring the approach can be realistically implemented and assessed in real-world biomedical AI environments, especially in high-stakes use cases like treatment recommendations involving subgroup biases. This will help pre-empt practical obstacles and provide stronger evidence for impact claims in clinical settings. Target these refinements in the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section for concreteness and robustness of validation methods and participant diversity strategies."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty screening labeled this work as NOV-COMPETITIVE — a new combination in a crowded space — a promising way to enhance impact and distinctiveness is to integrate cutting-edge generative techniques such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) with reinforcement learning from human feedback to dynamically tailor transparency layers at an individual user level (e.g., clinicians versus patients). Incorporating AI assistance modules that adaptively select or summarize explanations could improve scalability and personal relevance. Additionally, leveraging information retrieval to contextually augment model explanations with up-to-date scientific evidence dynamically linked during interaction can further boost trustworthiness and groundedness. Embedding these global AI advancements will help differentiate the work substantially by creating context-aware, user-customized transparency informed by real-time scientific content, amplifying both novelty and practical impact. Recommend explicitly embedding this direction as a future extension or parallel track in the Proposed_Method section for strategic positioning and competitive advantage."
