    "title": "Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Clinical Query Understanding",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current RAG methods primarily rely on textual data, lacking integration of heterogeneous clinical modalities such as audio recordings or imaging, which limits medical NLP accuracy and robustness for complex patient queries.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap of multimodal data integration by extending retrieval to combined text, audio, and imaging sources, inspired by cross-disciplinary developments like PodGPT. This enables richer context and improved clinical decision support, a key underexplored frontier in medical NLP.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a multimodal RAG architecture that indexes and retrieves multimodal clinical data (transcribed doctor-patient dialogues, lung sound recordings, X-rays) via specialized encoders feeding into a unified vector space. The LLM generator leverages multimodal retrieved embeddings through adaptive fusion layers to produce accurate, context-aware clinical text outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble multimodal clinical datasets (text plus audio, imaging), such as COPD patient data with therapist notes. 2. Develop modality-specific encoders (CNN for images, Wav2Vec for audio, transformers for text). 3. Build unified retrieval system over fused embeddings. 4. Train multimodal RAG LLM with cross-modal attention layers. 5. Evaluate on multimodal clinical question answering and diagnostic explanation tasks with metrics: accuracy, multimodal relevance, and trustworthiness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Patient coughs recorded during session, chest X-ray attached—what is likely diagnosis?\" Output: Precise clinical diagnosis with referenced audio and imaging evidence integrated into narrative, enhancing trust.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If fusion reduces generation quality, try late fusion strategies or modality dropout to identify bottlenecks. Incorporate clinician-in-the-loop validation to iteratively improve modality weighting."

        "title": "Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Clinical Query Understanding with Integrated Vision-Language and Intelligent Decision-Making",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches in clinical NLP predominantly focus on text-based data, failing to leverage heterogeneous clinical modalities like audio recordings and medical imaging. This shortcoming limits the accuracy, interpretability, and robustness of AI-driven clinical query understanding and decision support under real-world multimodal complexity.",
        "Motivation": "To address the competitive novelty gap in multimodal clinical AI research, we propose advancing beyond traditional text-only RAG by integrating state-of-the-art vision-language modeling and intelligent decision-making frameworks. Our approach unifies multimodal retrieval—text transcripts, lung sound audio, and chest X-rays—with adaptive LLM generation enriched by context-aware NLP techniques. This fusion, coupled with interactive clinician-in-the-loop evaluation, targets enhanced clinical interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and proactive diagnostic suggestions. Anchoring on these multidisciplinary AI advances enables a novel, clinically impactful paradigm for trustworthy multimodal medical NLP systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel multimodal RAG architecture that encodes and retrieves heterogeneous clinical data into a unified vector space using specialized encoders: transformer-based NLP for text, Wav2Vec2 for audio lung sounds, and fine-tuned CNN-based vision-language models for imaging. Leveraging advances from vision-language models (e.g., CLIP-like embeddings adapted to clinical images plus reports), we integrate an intelligent decision-making module atop the LLM generator, providing uncertainty quantification and proactive diagnostic suggestions to clinicians. The system employs cross-modal attention and adaptive fusion layers, enhanced with context-aware NLP techniques to handle domain-specific ambiguity and complexity. A phased design incorporates early clinician-in-the-loop modules for interpretability feedback and iterative refinement of modality weighting and fusion strategies, strengthening trustworthiness and clinical relevance.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Acquisition and Ethics Compliance: Secure access to ethically approved multimodal clinical datasets combining text (doctor-patient transcripts, clinical notes), audio (lung sounds), and images (chest X-rays) through partnerships with medical institutions; implement strict anonymization and compliance protocols. 2. Modality-Specific Encoder Development: Train and fine-tune transformers for clinical text, Wav2Vec2-based encoders for audio lung recordings, and CNN-based vision-language encoders pre-trained on medical image-report pairs to build unified embeddings. 3. Unified Retrieval and Fusion System: Construct a scalable retrieval system indexing multimodal embeddings; experiment with early, late, and hybrid fusion mechanisms incorporating modality dropout and noise-robustness testing simulating typical clinical data corruption. 4. Multimodal RAG LLM Training: Train the LLM generator augmented with cross-modal attention layers, integrated with intelligent decision-making modules for uncertainty scoring and diagnostic suggestion generation. 5. Clinician-in-the-Loop Prototyping: Conduct iterative user studies and interactive evaluations with domain experts to assess interpretability, usefulness, and refine system fusion and weighting. 6. Comprehensive Evaluation: Assess model performance on clinical question answering, multimodal relevance, diagnostic explanation fidelity, robustness under modality dropout/noise, and decision support utility using both quantitative metrics and qualitative clinician feedback.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Patient exhibits coughing recorded audio and abnormal chest X-ray images attached. Considering these multimodal inputs plus clinical notes, what is the most likely diagnosis with confidence estimates and referenced evidential sources?\" Output: A clinically coherent diagnostic narrative that integrates textual, audio, and imaging evidence, provides uncertainty quantification, explains reasoning leveraging vision-language insights, and offers proactive suggestions for further assessments, enhancing overall clinical trust and decision support.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If early fusion degrades generation quality or interpretability, we will pivot to late fusion strategies or modality dropout to isolate noisy modalities. Should data scarcity or ethical constraints impede large-scale training, we will adopt transfer learning from publicly available medical vision-language and audio datasets, coupled with synthetic data augmentation. Continuous clinician-in-the-loop feedback will guide iterative system refinement, improving robustness and modality-specific weighting. If intelligent decision-making modules prove less effective, simpler confidence calibration methods and rule-based clinical heuristics will be integrated to preserve trustworthiness."

To enhance feasibility, explicitly incorporate plans for data access and anonymization, phased prototyping with clinician-in-the-loop studies early to assess real-world utility, and robustness testing of multimodal fusion under data modality dropouts or noise typical in clinical environments. Addressing these points will strengthen the scientific soundness and practical viability of the experimentation pipeline without overly vague assumptions about data availability or system readiness for clinical deployment at the outset, which is critical in medical AI innovation contexts. This will mitigate risks of stalled progress due to underappreciated domain-specific constraints and improve overall project feasibility and impact trajectory early on within the plan section of the proposal.
