        "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Semantic Interoperable Dynamic Knowledge Graph Prompt Augmentation for Clinical RAG Systems",
        "Problem_Statement": "Contemporary medical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often treat clinical knowledge graphs (KGs) as static or secondary elements, failing to dynamically and efficiently integrate relevant KG substructures during prompt creation. This leads to limited contextual grounding, potential hallucinations, and challenges in clinical trustworthiness, especially given knowledge update uncertainties and token limitations in large language models (LLMs).",
        "Motivation": "Building upon existing efforts, our proposal addresses the NOV-COMPETITIVE gap by detailing a tightly coupled, runtime-feasible mechanism that dynamically extracts and encodes semantically interoperable KG subgraphs enriched through human-in-the-loop verification. This dual innovation prioritizes patient safety, clinical precision, and cross-system KG reuse while advancing fundamental AI methods by harmonizing graph transformer adaptations with NLP prompt engineering in high-stakes healthcare contexts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Our method unfolds in three core components: (1) entity and relation extraction from clinical queries via enhanced Named Entity Recognition (NER) aligned with semantic interoperability standards (e.g., HL7 FHIR); (2) dynamic subgraph retrieval leveraging heuristics and approximate graph traversals that prioritize topologically and semantically salient KG regions with latency-conscious pruning strategies; these subgraphs are encoded using a transformer-based graph encoder inspired by Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, producing dense, token-length compliant embeddings compatible with LLM prompt contexts; (3) a human-in-the-loop curation interface enabling clinical experts to review, validate, or refine retrieved subgraphs before prompt augmentation, thereby ensuring bio-clinical validity and supporting feedback loops that correct KG inconsistencies or update needs. The integration carefully manages prompt token budgets using attention-guided graph summarization and semantic compression. This system also embeds semantic interoperability metadata into the prompt context to enhance downstream model reasoning and facilitate broader clinical pipeline integration.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble or extend clinical KGs adhering to semantic interoperability standards; select datasets with real-world clinical queries. 2. Develop and benchmark entity/relation extraction module aligned to medical NER and interoperability vocabularies. 3. Design and implement the dynamic subgraph retrieval algorithm with latency and relevance trade-offs, embedding a transformer-based graph encoder inspired by ViT adaptations. 4. Build a human-in-the-loop interface for subgraph verification, recruiting clinical domain experts for iterative curation cycles. 5. Integrate the enriched prompt augmentation pipeline with standard LLM and RAG architectures. 6. Evaluate system performance on metrics including domain-specific accuracy, hallucination incidence, bio-clinical validity, prompt token efficiency, retrieval latency, and clinician trust assessment. 7. Conduct ablation studies separating contributions of semantic interoperability integration, graph transformer encoding, and human verification steps.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What are contraindications for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in patients with depression?\"\nProcess: Entity extraction identifies 'CBT,' 'depression'; dynamic subgraph retrieval queries interconnected nodes relating treatment contraindications in depression from semantically interoperable clinical KGs; expert clinician reviews and validates the retrieved subgraph for accuracy; graph transformer encodes subgraph context within prompt token limits.\nOutput: The LLM generates a well-grounded response referencing dynamically verified clinical knowledge graph entries on contraindications, reducing hallucinations and increasing clinical trust.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If transformer-based subgraph encoding coupled with human-in-the-loop verification induces higher latency or token overflow, fallback strategies include: (a) selective application of summarization techniques that leverage semantic interoperability metadata for maximal context preservation; (b) configurable granularity control in graph traversal to limit subgraph size; (c) batch human reviews on flagged queries only, to balance throughput and safety; (d) integrating lightweight KG consistency checks to flag potentially outdated subgraphs, triggering automatic requests for data updates or manual revisions."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method would benefit from clearer articulation of the mechanisms underlying dynamic subgraph extraction and encoding. Currently, it's unclear how the system ensures timely and relevant subgraph retrieval without significant latency, and how these subgraphs are encoded in a form that LLMs can effectively consume given token limitations. More explicit detail on the interaction between entity/relation extraction, subgraph traversal, and prompt augmentation is needed to verify conceptual soundness and operational coherence, especially in clinical settings where precision is critical. Consider incorporating preliminary designs or algorithmic sketches to bolster clarity and confidence in the approach's feasibility at runtime in real RAG pipelines with large KGs and complex queries, to ensure the integration is practical and scalable without degradation of response time or accuracy at inference time. This will also help demarcate the novelty and operational boundaries of the proposed mechanism within existing tightly coupled KG-LLM frameworks in medical NLP contexts, beyond just an additive subgraph retrieval step embedded in prompt construction. Detailed conceptual grounding of these interactions will strengthen submission soundness substantially and better align claims with established assumptions about dynamic KG use in prompting pipelines for LLMs in high-stakes domains like medicine where misinterpretations have real consequences.  \n\nAdditionally, consider potential limitations related to knowledge updates or inconsistencies within KGs which may propagate into generated outputs, and whether supporting verification or feedback loops might be required beyond simple augmentation to ensure bio-clinical validity and trustworthiness of output especially when dynamically incorporating graph substructures into prompts."

          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screening Novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the rich opportunities for enhancing the proposalâ€™s novelty and impact, I strongly suggest integrating advanced concepts such as 'human-in-the-loop approaches' and 'semantic interoperability'. For instance, incorporating a human verification or curation step for dynamically retrieved subgraphs before prompt augmentation could enhance patient safety and clinical trustworthiness, a critical factor in medical NLP. Further, leveraging semantic interoperability standards within knowledge representation and KG construction would position the system uniquely within healthcare AI pipeline infrastructures, promoting better cross-system integration and reuse of clinical knowledge graphs. These directions could substantially differentiate the work from competing approaches by emphasizing practical clinical deployment readiness, safety, and broader ecosystem integration beyond isolated RAG retrieval enhancement. Additionally, exploring the interaction between transformer architectures and graph encoding modulesâ€”potentially via adaptations inspired by Vision Transformers or other transformer variants specialized for graph dataâ€”could also boost novelty and performance, providing a compelling technical contribution complementing the medical domain application. This combined extension aligns with the globally linked concepts and the strategic challenge of advancing both fundamental AI methodology and clinical applicability simultaneously, elevating acceptance potential at premier venues."
