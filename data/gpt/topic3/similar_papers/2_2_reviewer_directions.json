    "title": "Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Clinical Query Understanding",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current RAG methods primarily rely on textual data, lacking integration of heterogeneous clinical modalities such as audio recordings or imaging, which limits medical NLP accuracy and robustness for complex patient queries.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap of multimodal data integration by extending retrieval to combined text, audio, and imaging sources, inspired by cross-disciplinary developments like PodGPT. This enables richer context and improved clinical decision support, a key underexplored frontier in medical NLP.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a multimodal RAG architecture that indexes and retrieves multimodal clinical data (transcribed doctor-patient dialogues, lung sound recordings, X-rays) via specialized encoders feeding into a unified vector space. The LLM generator leverages multimodal retrieved embeddings through adaptive fusion layers to produce accurate, context-aware clinical text outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble multimodal clinical datasets (text plus audio, imaging), such as COPD patient data with therapist notes. 2. Develop modality-specific encoders (CNN for images, Wav2Vec for audio, transformers for text). 3. Build unified retrieval system over fused embeddings. 4. Train multimodal RAG LLM with cross-modal attention layers. 5. Evaluate on multimodal clinical question answering and diagnostic explanation tasks with metrics: accuracy, multimodal relevance, and trustworthiness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Patient coughs recorded during session, chest X-ray attachedâ€”what is likely diagnosis?\" Output: Precise clinical diagnosis with referenced audio and imaging evidence integrated into narrative, enhancing trust.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If fusion reduces generation quality, try late fusion strategies or modality dropout to identify bottlenecks. Incorporate clinician-in-the-loop validation to iteratively improve modality weighting."

To enhance feasibility, explicitly incorporate plans for data access and anonymization, phased prototyping with clinician-in-the-loop studies early to assess real-world utility, and robustness testing of multimodal fusion under data modality dropouts or noise typical in clinical environments. Addressing these points will strengthen the scientific soundness and practical viability of the experimentation pipeline without overly vague assumptions about data availability or system readiness for clinical deployment at the outset, which is critical in medical AI innovation contexts. This will mitigate risks of stalled progress due to underappreciated domain-specific constraints and improve overall project feasibility and impact trajectory early on within the plan section of the proposal.

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty rating 'NOV-COMPETITIVE', the proposal should explicitly leverage and integrate relevant globally linked concepts such as vision-language models, medical report generation, and intelligent decision-making to enhance differentiation and impact. For instance, propose adapting state-of-the-art vision-language approaches to improve interpretability and trust in clinical outputs, or integrate context-aware NLP techniques with retrieval-augmented LLMs to better handle domain-specific complexity and ambiguity. Embedding intelligent decision-making frameworks with multimodal retrieval could boost clinical relevance by enabling proactive suggestions or uncertainty quantification. Anchoring the approach firmly in these connected AI advances will fortify its novelty and help position it competitively in the rapidly evolving multimodal medical NLP research landscape. Concrete incorporation of such multidisciplinary ideas should be explicitly articulated and operationalized as part of method design or evaluation to elevate scientific contribution and practical significance.
