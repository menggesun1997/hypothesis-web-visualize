        "title": "Federated Clinical-Power Dispatch LLM Tuning for Privacy and Robustness",
        "Problem_Statement": "Integrating LLMs into domains like power dispatch and biomedical NLP faces challenges in privacy, efficiency, and robustness when fine-tuning on sensitive, heterogeneous data from multiple sources. Traditional centralized fine-tuning incurs privacy risks and inefficiencies.",
        "Motivation": "This idea directly addresses internal gaps (a) scalability, (c) privacy in deployment, and external gap leveraging federated learning methods combined with semantic knowledge tuning to enable decentralized, privacy-preserving LLM adaptation for domain-specific tasks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a federated learning framework where multiple domain entities (e.g., hospitals, power plants) collaboratively train an LLM. The method incorporates semantic knowledge tuning to infuse domain expertise efficiently. Model updates are aggregated with differential privacy guarantees to protect sensitive data. A multi-task objective balances general language understanding with domain-specific task accuracy and robustness.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect federated datasets from biomedical text and power dispatch logs. 2. Use a pre-trained LLM as base. 3. Implement federated semantic knowledge tuning (FedSKT). 4. Baselines: centralized fine-tuning and vanilla federated tuning without knowledge injection. 5. Evaluate on domain task accuracy, robustness under domain shifts, privacy leakage metrics, and training efficiency.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Power dispatch instruction text with embedded sensor data references. Expected Output: Accurate, robust task-relevant summary with no sensitive info leakage. Input: Clinical notes for diagnosis prediction. Expected Output: High-accuracy prediction maintaining patient data privacy.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated semantic tuning struggles with convergence, fallback to hybrid semi-federated approaches where smaller sub-models are tuned locally and ensembled. Alternatively, reduce model size or incorporate knowledge distillation to improve stability."

        "title": "Human-Centered Adaptive LLM Training Using Brain-Computer Interface Feedback",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks lacks dynamic human-in-the-loop optimization, leading to rigid models that may not align well with end-user needs and real-time task complexity.",
        "Motivation": "Tackles internal gap (b) interpretability and robustness issues, and external gap bringing in human-centered computing advances from brain-computer interfaces to optimize LLM interaction and training protocols, enhancing real-time adaptation and human-machine synergy.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design an adaptive LLM fine-tuning loop regulated by real-time human cognitive and affective states measured via non-invasive brain-computer interface sensors. The system dynamically adjusts learning rates, parameter focus, and interaction modalities based on user mental workload and feedback signals. This feedback-guided training improves model robustness and interpretability tailored to individual user contexts.",

Evaluate improvements in user satisfaction, task success rate, model adaptation speed, and robustness under complex scenarios.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Real-time domain-specific query posed by operator with EEG monitoring. Output: Adaptively generated response minimizing hallucinations and aligned with cognitive load. E.g., if user is stressed, model simplifies explanations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If BCI feedback signals prove noisy or low-quality, fallback to user explicit feedback or physiological proxies like heart rate variability. Alternatively, simulate feedback signals with proxy datasets to refine controller."
