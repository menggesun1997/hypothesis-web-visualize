        "title": "Multimodal Human-in-the-Loop Bias Auditing for Clinical LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs adapted to biomedical domains exhibit persistent biases that adversely affect decision-making across diverse patient subgroups, particularly in clinical settings. Existing bias auditing tools lack integration of domain expert feedback during the model lifecycle, limiting effective bias identification and mitigation.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the internal gap of insufficient human-in-the-loop mechanisms and the external gap of embedding health professionals' perspectives within AI pipelines, as identified in the Research Landscape. By integrating direct stakeholder engagement from clinicians in a structured, multimodal bias auditing framework, it innovates beyond current static bias evaluation methods.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a human-in-the-loop multimodal bias auditing system combining clinical textual notes, medical images, and LLM outputs. The system engages health professionals via interactive dashboards that highlight potential bias signals detected from model outputs and input data distributions. Clinicians provide real-time annotations on bias relevance and severity, which are encoded and fed back to adjust model fine-tuning dynamically through continual learning protocols. The framework also incorporates patient subgroup metadata for granular bias tracking and iterative interpretability modules to explain model rationale.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect diverse biomedical datasets with patient subgroup annotations including clinical notes and associated images (e.g., MIMIC-IV, CheXpert). 2) Fine-tune a foundation LLM on biomedical data. 3) Implement the bias signal detection engine based on statistical disparities and representational analyses. 4) Build a clinician-facing interface for bias feedback. 5) Conduct iterative human-in-the-loop fine-tuning cycles leveraging clinician annotations. 6) Evaluate bias reduction using fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity difference, equalized odds) on held-out subgroups, alongside clinical relevance assessed through expert surveys.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical text describing a chest X-ray report referencing symptoms in an elderly female patient subgroup. Model output initially underestimates pneumothorax risk for elderly women. After clinician bias annotation via the system highlighting subgroup underprediction, the model updates its risk estimation. Output: Adjusted risk prediction reflecting appropriate pneumothorax risk for elderly female patients, increasing fairness and clinical trustworthiness.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time clinician feedback proves logistically challenging, simulate human-in-the-loop annotations using synthetic expert knowledge bases and retrospective bias labels. Alternatively, enhance model interpretability modules to allow automated bias explanations facilitating self-correction without immediate human input."

        "title": "Stakeholder-Integrated Co-Design Framework for Fair Biomedical LLM Pipelines",
        "Problem_Statement": "While co-design principles for AI pipelines exist, there is a lack of concrete frameworks that embed perspectives from health professionals and patients systematically into the design and deployment of large biomedical LLMs to ensure fairness and interpretability.",
        "Motivation": "This proposal specifically addresses the opportunity to integrate stakeholder engagement frameworks derived from 'health professionalsâ€™ perspectives' and 'patient attitudes' with co-design principles (a high-potential innovation opportunity). The novelty lies in formalizing a systematic, iterative co-design methodology involving multi-stakeholder participation along the entire AI development lifecycle for fairness optimization.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Introduce an iterative co-design framework that structures participation from healthcare providers, patients, AI developers, and ethicists through modular workshops, surveys, and collaborative design sessions. Incorporate these inputs into adaptive LLM pipeline components including data curation, bias audit checkpoints, and interpretability layers. The framework features a feedback-driven fairness scoring system that dynamically adjusts model training objectives according to stakeholder priorities. It also integrates scenario-based simulations to evaluate real-world impact of design choices and refinements before deployment.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Identify biomedical LLM application domain (e.g., clinical decision support). 2) Recruit representative stakeholders including clinicians, patients, AI researchers, and bioethicists. 3) Develop co-design curriculum and data collection instruments. 4) Conduct initial workshops to capture fairness concerns and priorities. 5) Implement pipeline adaptations incorporating stakeholder inputs. 6) Run scenario-based model evaluations for fairness (both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback). 7) Iterate the process through multiple development cycles. 8) Compare model fairness and trust metrics against standard AI development pipelines without co-design integration.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Stakeholder feedback revealing concerns about underrepresentation of minority patient symptoms leading to misdiagnoses. Output: Adapted LLM training datasets enhanced with targeted minority subgroup data and updated interpretability modules highlighting symptom relevance, demonstrated to improve fairness metrics and stakeholder trust scores.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If stakeholder engagement participation is limited, use case studies and literature mining to proxy stakeholder concerns. Alternatively, implement a pilot on a smaller scale focusing on only health professionals or patients initially before scaling to include all stakeholders."

        "title": "Science Journalism-Informed Transparency Layers for Biomedical LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Biomedical AI ecosystems lack robust transparency and bias reporting mechanisms that draw on communication/media insights, resulting in insufficient public trust and ethical stewardship, especially in high-stakes clinical contexts.",
        "Motivation": "This project targets the external gap connecting 'artificial general intelligence' and 'AI ecosystem' to communication and media studies. The novelty is in fusing science journalism quality frameworks into AI model transparency architectures, enhancing public comprehension and trust while mitigating bias obfuscation in biomedical LLMs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design transparency layers inspired by best practices in science journalism, embedding narrative clarity, source credibility tagging, and uncertainty communication into LLM output explanations. Develop a bias reporting standard whose format and dissemination emulate high-quality science journalism techniques, including contextualizing findings with analogies, impact narratives, and expert quotes. Integrate these layers into biomedical AI interfaces enabling clinicians and patients to access layered explanations co-created with communication specialists.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Analyze exemplary science journalism pieces to extract narrative and transparency principles. 2) Build explanation templates for biomedical LLM outputs incorporating these principles. 3) Implement bias reporting protocols structured as digestible, multi-level reports (technical to layman). 4) Conduct user studies with medical professionals and patient groups to assess interpretability, trust, and perceived fairness. 5) Compare with standard explanation techniques using metrics such as comprehension scores, trust ratings, and bias detection accuracy.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM-generated clinical recommendation for treatment with known subgroup efficacy disparities. Output: Accompanying transparency layer explaining recommendation rationale with lay-friendly narratives highlighting known biases, uncertainties, and expert opinions in accessible language improving user understanding and trust.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If specialized transparency layers are too complex for real-time system integration, fall back to generating post-hoc science journalism-style reports. Alternatively, employ automated summarization techniques constrained by audience expertise level to approximate this effect."

        "title": "Bioethics-Guided Fairness Auditing for Smart Hospital AI Systems",
        "Problem_Statement": "Fairness auditing of large foundation models in clinical settings is fragmented, with poor integration of organizational, legal, and bioethical dimensions intrinsic to smart hospital workflows and electronic health records (EHRs). This limits model generalizability and acceptance.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the external gap between 'AI ecosystem' and 'care system', this research innovates by embedding bioethical principles and hospital organizational policies directly into fairness auditing tools tailored for smart hospital AI deployment. It goes beyond purely technical bias metrics by fusing institutional constraints, patient care pathways, and legal governance into AI fairness assessments.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a bioethics-guided fairness auditing framework that semantically integrates smart hospital policies, patient rights legislation, and clinical care pathways with foundation model evaluations. The framework uses ontology-based representation of organizational norms linked with EHR data and model predictions to detect fairness violations that are both statistically and ethically significant. It enables real-time auditing coupled with actionable recommendations for model adjustments or deployment constraints within hospital AI ecosystems.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate datasets including EHRs, clinical AI outputs, and hospital policy documents. 2) Formalize ontologies representing bioethical and organizational principles relevant to fairness. 3) Implement an auditing engine coupling statistical fairness metrics with ontology-driven ethical assessments. 4) Test framework on clinical decision-making LLM applications within simulated smart hospital settings. 5) Validate ability to detect fairness lapses that violate both quantitative and qualitative criteria. 6) Collect domain expert feedback on framework utility and impact.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM clinical decision output recommending a treatment biased against patients from a minority demographic. The framework identifies disparity and flags violation of hospital non-discrimination ethics policy. Output: Fairness audit report detailing the bias, conflicting organizational norms, and recommendations for model retraining or deployment restrictions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If ontology integration proves too complex, employ rule-based proxies of bioethical principles or expert-in-the-loop assessments. Alternatively, focus on modular auditing components that incrementally incorporate organizational aspects into existing statistical audits."

        "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Experimental Platform for Fairness Benchmarking in Clinical LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Benchmarks for evaluating fairness and bias mitigation in clinical LLMs lack incorporation of social, communicative, and organizational dimensions essential for holistic assessments, leading to partial evaluations that miss real-world impact nuances.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the novel external gaps involving communication, media studies, and organizational aspects, this idea proposes a cross-disciplinary experimental platform combining social science-informed metrics with technical fairness measures for richer evaluations, expanding beyond the isolated biomedical AI tradelines.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create an open experimental platform integrating quantitative fairness metrics, human-subject evaluation modules (e.g., stakeholder surveys, trust indexes), and organizational policy simulation tools. The platform supports plug-and-play evaluation of biomedical LLMs, aggregating technical, social, and ethical fairness indicators. It uses modular architecture enabling integration of media feedback analysis (e.g., misinformation spread), clinical workflow embedding effects, and patient-centered interpretability outcomes.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Define comprehensive fairness and bias metrics embracing technical performance, social perception, and organizational compliance. 2) Assemble datasets and simulation environments capturing clinical workflows and media dissemination scenarios. 3) Implement interfaces for stakeholder engagement data collection. 4) Benchmark multiple clinical LLMs using the platform. 5) Publish open benchmarks and toolkits for community use. 6) Validate improvements in holistic fairness when models are optimized according to platform feedback.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Evaluation of LLM-generated clinical alerts in a smart hospital context combined with simulated media report dissemination and patient trust surveys. Output: Multi-dimensional fairness report highlighting technical accuracy, stakeholder trust levels, and misinformation risks informing model refinement.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If stakeholder engagement data collection is limited, use simulated proxies based on literature-informed social models. If media analysis modules underperform, focus on clinical and organizational fairness assessments initially before expanding."
