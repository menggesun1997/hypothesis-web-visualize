        "title": "Federated Privacy-Optimized Lightweight LLM Architectures for Scalable Local Healthcare Networks",
        "Problem_Statement": "Deploying large LLMs within secure, resource-constrained local healthcare networks remains challenged by the trade-offs among model size, latency, and strict privacy regulations. Existing solutions relying on oversized models or cloud connectivity fail to meet diverse hospital IT infrastructure constraints and data sovereignty requirements, hindering scalable adoption in privacy-sensitive clinical environments.",
        "Motivation": "Building on the identified internal gap of lack of efficient local LLM deployment in healthcare and external opportunities in privacy preservation, this work elevates the problem by integrating federated learning with lightweight, privacy-optimized LLM architectures. This approach enables secure, collaborative model adaptation across heterogeneous healthcare networks without compromising data sovereignty or requiring cloud access. By systematically addressing computational feasibility, auditability, and adversarial resilience tailored for varied hospital IT environments, the proposal advances beyond compression-only methods toward a scalable, sustainable solution with enhanced novelty and clinical impact.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular LLM architecture pipeline combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (adapters, LoRA), progressive model compression (quantization, distillation), and local differential privacy (LDP) layers designed for resource-constrained healthcare edges. This pipeline is integrated within a federated learning framework supporting privacy-preserving collaborative updates and federated personalization using hospital-specific clinical data without data sharing. Audit logging and robust security controls are embedded and validated under realistic healthcare adversarial threat models, including anomaly and DDoS attack detection. Knowledge graph-enhanced task-specific fine-tuning is incorporated to boost interpretability and clinical relevance. APIs are designed for latency-optimized, secure clinical workflow integration, adaptable to diverse hospital IT stacks. The method concretely characterizes performance, privacy, and security trade-offs, prioritizing realistic deployability and compliance with healthcare regulations.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Benchmark selection: choose pretrained biomedical LLMs and establish hospital IT infrastructure profiles representing diverse resource availability and security policies.\n2. Define quantitative metrics and thresholds: latency under 200 ms for typical queries, LDP privacy budget ε ≤ 1.0, model accuracy degradation ≤ 3% post-compression, audit log tampering detection rate ≥ 95%, and adversarial robustness under simulated threat scenarios.\n3. Implement progressive compression with adapters, LoRA, quantization, and distillation, measuring model accuracy, latency, and memory across representative hardware.\n4.

Analyze fallback scenarios with hybrid edge-local server architectures and propose deployment decision criteria based on quantitative thresholds.\n11. Plan timeline with iterative 3-month sprints, including pre-deployment feasibility assessments, midterm security audits, and final validation demonstrating readiness for clinical pilot deployments.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multi-institution clinical note datasets partitioned across simulated hospitals requiring automatic ICD coding.\nExpected Output: Locally generated, accurate ICD codes within 200 ms latency per note, with encrypted audit trail entries ensuring tamper-proof access records, preserved across federated updates with privacy budget ε ≤ 1.0 and no raw data exchange.\nAdversarial Scenario: Simulated DDoS attack on local network triggers detection and mitigation within acceptable thresholds, preserving system availability.\nFederated Learning Scenario: Hospital-specific model personalization achieves ≥ 5% performance gain over non-personalized baseline without privacy budget violations and maintains compliance with healthcare data regulations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If local LDP integration degrades accuracy or latency beyond thresholds, or robustness validation fails, we will adopt a hybrid federated architecture splitting inference between lightweight edge models and a secure on-premises local server cluster.

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is comprehensive but lacks concrete details on measurement criteria and technical feasibility metrics, especially regarding integration with diverse hospital IT infrastructures. It would be beneficial to explicitly define performance thresholds for latency and privacy compliance, specify how local differential privacy layers will be quantitatively evaluated, and concretely address scalability challenges within real-world constrained environments before pilot deployment. Clarify fallback criteria quantitatively and timeline estimates to better support feasibility assessment and resource planning, ensuring experiments realistically map onto typical hospital IT and regulatory environments without reliance on unspecified infrastructure changes or assumptions about IT readiness levels. This will improve confidence in experimental validity and practical deployability in diverse healthcare settings, making the overall plan more scientifically sound and operationally feasible, particularly as local deployment constraints vary significantly across hospitals worldwide. Also, elaborate on how audit logging and security layers will be validated under realistic adversarial scenarios or security threat models relevant to healthcare data environments, ensuring robustness beyond functional tests alone in Step 3 and 5. Strengthening the experimental plan with these actionable technical evaluations will help validate core assumptions and method feasibility essential for clinical adoption and impact realization in privacy-sensitive healthcare workflows.  This should be prioritized before further architectural development to identify key bottlenecks and adaptation needs early on in the research lifecycle, well aligned with the stated motivation for local network deployments with strict privacy and resource constraints.  Please revise the experiment plan to systematically incorporate these feasibility-focused evaluation aspects to justify methodological soundness and realistic healthcare deployment potential comprehensively.  This detailed expansion addresses a critical feasibility gap central to the project's success and clinical impact potential in protected healthcare network environments, helping future reviewers and adopters build trust in the solution's real-world viability and readiness for integration with sensitive clinical infrastructures and regulatory standards beyond prototype-level demonstration."

          "feedback_content": "Given the idea's novelty status as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the tightly-focused healthcare local deployment domain, integrating federated learning (FL) with the proposed privacy-optimized lightweight architectures could substantially enhance the idea's impact and novelty. Specifically, adopting federated personalization methods can enable collaborative model improvement across multiple local healthcare networks without sharing sensitive data externally, addressing both privacy and scalability concerns identified. Combining FL with differential privacy layers already proposed can create a robust privacy-preserving training and update mechanism, allowing continual model adaptation to local clinical needs while maintaining strict data sovereignty and auditability. This integration aligns with globally linked concepts like 'federated learning', 'privacy preservation', and 'federated personalization' and leverages trends in distributed healthcare AI to differentiate the approach significantly from existing lightweight compression-only works. Furthermore, incorporating knowledge graphs or task-specific fine-tuning using federated updates might boost interpretability and domain alignment, enhancing clinical decision support system integration benefits. Incorporating this federated distributed learning perspective earlier in the design, even if as part of the fallback or future direction, will help emphasize scalability, long-term maintenance, and cross-institution learning advantages. This targeted suggestion directly addresses competitive novelty challenges by proposing a clear, feasible augmentation leveraging global research trends, potentially elevating the work's significance, relevance, and adoption in state-of-the-art privacy-aware healthcare AI solutions. Please consider refining the proposed method and experimental plan to explore federated learning frameworks compatible with the lightweight LLM compression and privacy constraints outlined."
