    "title": "Cognitive Psychology-Informed Prompt Engineering for Robust Automated Essay Scoring",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM-based automated essay scoring systems show high variability influenced by prompt sensitivity and hyperparameters like temperature, yielding inconsistent scoring that poorly aligns with human evaluators, especially on factors like empathy and trustfulness of content.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the internal gap of unreliable multi-dimensional NLP tasks and the external gap highlighting underexplored cognitive psychology insights, this project synergizes psychological theories of human writing performance into prompt design and evaluation metrics to improve score reliability and human-model alignment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a prompt engineering framework grounded in cognitive and computational psychology principles including working memory constraints, concept structuring, and emotional tone recognition. Develop a multidimensional scoring rubric embedding criteria for empathy, ethical reasoning, and trust signals. Use reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) calibrated on psychometric assessments to tune prompts. Incorporate an explainability module that justifies each score dimension through psychologically meaningful features extracted from essays.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate essay datasets annotated with traditional scores plus psychological dimensions (e.g., empathy, trust). \n2. Develop baseline prompt templates and evaluate scoring variability.\n3. Construct cognitive theory-informed prompts emphasizing psychological aspects.\n4. Train scoring LLMs with RLHF using human psychometric judgments.\n5. Compare scoring reliability and human alignment versus baselines.\n6. Perform ablation studies of prompt components related to cognitive factors.\n7. Validate on new unseen datasets and real educational settings.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Student essay on climate change emphasizing ethical responsibility.\nExpected Output: Scores reflecting content accuracy, persuasive argumentation, empathy for affected communities, and trustworthiness of claims, accompanied by explanations mapping sections of the essay to each score category.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If RLHF does not improve reliability, experiment with ensemble models incorporating specialized smaller networks for each dimension. Alternatively, explore adversarial prompt tuning to reduce sensitivity and stabilize outputs across temperature settings."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is generally well-structured but lacks concrete details and contingency measures that ensure scientific rigor and practical feasibility. For instance, the plan suggests annotating essay datasets with psychological dimensions such as empathy and trust, but it does not specify the annotation protocols, inter-annotator agreement targets, or the scalability of such annotations given the subjective nature of these dimensions. Additionally, steps involving RLHF tuned on psychometric assessments are ambitious and complex; the plan should include pilot studies or simpler interim validation checkpoints to mitigate risk. To improve feasibility, specify protocols for annotation quality control, clarify the scale and source of datasets, outline resource requirements for RLHF training, and include fallback evaluation strategies before deploying on real educational settings. Providing realistic timelines and resource estimates will also strengthen feasibility confidence and increase chances of successful validation in practice. The current plan reads high-level and aspirational rather than pragmatic and resource-aware, which is critical for execution in this competitive space. This feedback targets the Experiment_Plan section for enhanced scientific and practical rigor prior to implementation to ensure robust outcomes and reproducibility in such a novel framework integrating cognitive psychology and NLP scoring rigorously at scale.

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and the project's multidisciplinary nature, the idea can significantly increase its impact and distinctiveness by explicitly integrating legal and ethical frameworks such as the Artificial Intelligence Act or Digital Services Act into the design of the scoring rubric and explainability module. Incorporating compliance with human rights law and ethical AI principles would enhance trustworthiness and societal relevance, especially since essay scoring touches on evaluation fairness and bias mitigation. Further, grounding the model's evaluation and prompt design not only in cognitive psychology but also in regulatory mandates about transparency and fairness will create a robust alignment between AI capabilities and societal/legal expectations. This integration can open avenues for the system to support educational practices aligned with legal duty and educational equity mandates. Leveraging globally linked concepts such as 'Artificial Intelligence Act', 'human rights law', and 'enhance educational practices' is thus recommended to broaden impact and novelty while addressing real-world AI governance challenges in automated evaluation. This feedback targets the Proposed_Method and Test_Case_Examples sections by recommending cross-disciplinary expansion to substantially elevate impact and distinctiveness within the competitive landscape.
