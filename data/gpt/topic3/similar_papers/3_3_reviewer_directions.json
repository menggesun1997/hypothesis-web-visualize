    "title": "Bioethics-Guided Fairness Auditing for Smart Hospital AI Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Fairness auditing of large foundation models in clinical settings is fragmented, with poor integration of organizational, legal, and bioethical dimensions intrinsic to smart hospital workflows and electronic health records (EHRs). This limits model generalizability and acceptance.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the external gap between 'AI ecosystem' and 'care system', this research innovates by embedding bioethical principles and hospital organizational policies directly into fairness auditing tools tailored for smart hospital AI deployment. It goes beyond purely technical bias metrics by fusing institutional constraints, patient care pathways, and legal governance into AI fairness assessments.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a bioethics-guided fairness auditing framework that semantically integrates smart hospital policies, patient rights legislation, and clinical care pathways with foundation model evaluations. The framework uses ontology-based representation of organizational norms linked with EHR data and model predictions to detect fairness violations that are both statistically and ethically significant. It enables real-time auditing coupled with actionable recommendations for model adjustments or deployment constraints within hospital AI ecosystems.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate datasets including EHRs, clinical AI outputs, and hospital policy documents. 2) Formalize ontologies representing bioethical and organizational principles relevant to fairness. 3) Implement an auditing engine coupling statistical fairness metrics with ontology-driven ethical assessments. 4) Test framework on clinical decision-making LLM applications within simulated smart hospital settings. 5) Validate ability to detect fairness lapses that violate both quantitative and qualitative criteria. 6) Collect domain expert feedback on framework utility and impact.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM clinical decision output recommending a treatment biased against patients from a minority demographic. The framework identifies disparity and flags violation of hospital non-discrimination ethics policy. Output: Fairness audit report detailing the bias, conflicting organizational norms, and recommendations for model retraining or deployment restrictions.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If ontology integration proves too complex, employ rule-based proxies of bioethical principles or expert-in-the-loop assessments. Alternatively, focus on modular auditing components that incrementally incorporate organizational aspects into existing statistical audits."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-MECHANISM",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed method relies heavily on ontology-based integration of diverse normative sources (bioethical principles, organizational policies, legislation) with statistical fairness metrics to audit clinical AI models. However, the mechanism for harmonizing heterogeneous and potentially conflicting norms, and how these influence concrete fairness violation detection and actionable recommendations, is not clearly articulated. Clarify the semantic integration process, conflict resolution strategies, and the interpretability of combined ethical and statistical signals to strengthen soundness and usability of the framework, especially for real-time deployment in hospital settings where decisions must be transparent and justifiable. Provide illustrative examples of how ontology-driven ethical assessments quantitatively alter audit outcomes relative to pure statistical audits, to make the mechanism more concrete and convincing in context of clinical workflow constraints and legal risks (e.g., non-discrimination laws). That is critical for building trust and adoption in high-stakes smart hospital AI environments. This improvement will ensure the framework's technical foundation and ethical reasoning are robust, credible, and practically implementable at scale in complex real-world settings, beyond conceptual appeal alone. Targeted elaboration on this core mechanism is thus urgently needed for the work's soundness and clarity to reach premier conference standards (e.g., NeurIPS or ACL).

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan is comprehensive but ambitious, involving curation of multiple datasets (EHRs, clinical AI outputs, policy docs), ontology formalization, engine implementation, and evaluation under simulated hospital settings with expert feedback. However, this plan underestimates the extreme challenges of assembling and harmonizing clinical EHR data with legal and organizational documents while preserving patient privacy and regulatory compliance. Specifically: 1) Accessing sufficiently large and representative EHR datasets with suitable labels and demographic metadata is highly non-trivial; 2) Formalizing ontologies that accurately represent nuanced bioethical and hospital policies requires extensive interdisciplinary collaboration and iterative validation; 3) Simulated hospital settings may lack fidelity to capture real-world deployment complexity. These factors endanger timely and reproducible evaluation. To enhance feasibility, it is important to explicate concrete strategies for data access or synthetic data generation, plans for expert ontology curation workflows, and scalable simulation/testbed environments. Consider modularizing the experimentation focus into tractable intermediate milestones, such as initially auditing a subset of policies or thematic fairness dimensions, balancing methodological rigor with practical constraints. Addressing these feasibility constraints explicitly will increase confidence in deliverability and impact of the research, crucial for acceptance in top-tier venues with strong empirical standards.
