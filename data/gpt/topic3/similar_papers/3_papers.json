    "abstract": "Foundation Models (FMs) are gaining increasing attention in the biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem due to their ability to represent and contextualize multimodal biomedical data. These capabilities make FMs a valuable tool for a variety of tasks, including biomedical reasoning, hypothesis generation, and interpreting complex imaging data. In this review paper, we address the unique challenges associated with establishing an ethical and trustworthy biomedical AI ecosystem, with a particular focus on the development of FMs and their downstream applications. We explore strategies that can be implemented throughout the biomedical AI pipeline to effectively tackle these challenges, ensuring that these FMs are translated responsibly into clinical and translational settings. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of key stewardship and co-design principles that not only ensure robust regulation but also guarantee that the interests of all stakeholders-especially those involved in or affected by these clinical and translational applications-are adequately represented. We aim to empower the biomedical AI community to harness these models responsibly and effectively. As we navigate this exciting frontier, our collective commitment to ethical stewardship, co-design, and responsible translation will be instrumental in ensuring that the evolution of FMs truly enhances patient care and medical decision-making, ultimately leading to a more equitable and trustworthy biomedical AI ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Biases in medical artificial intelligence (AI) arise and compound throughout the AI lifecycle. These biases can have significant clinical consequences, especially in applications that involve clinical decision-making. Left unaddressed, biased medical AI can lead to substandard clinical decisions and the perpetuation and exacerbation of longstanding healthcare disparities. We discuss potential biases that can arise at different stages in the AI development pipeline and how they can affect AI algorithms and clinical decision-making. Bias can occur in data features and labels, model development and evaluation, deployment, and publication. Insufficient sample sizes for certain patient groups can result in suboptimal performance, algorithm underestimation, and clinically unmeaningful predictions. Missing patient findings can also produce biased model behavior, including capturable but nonrandomly missing data, such as diagnosis codes, and data that is not usually or not easily captured, such as social determinants of health. Expertly annotated labels used to train supervised learning models may reflect implicit cognitive biases or substandard care practices. Overreliance on performance metrics during model development may obscure bias and diminish a model's clinical utility. When applied to data outside the training cohort, model performance can deteriorate from previous validation and can do so differentially across subgroups. How end users interact with deployed solutions can introduce bias. Finally, where models are developed and published, and by whom, impacts the trajectories and priorities of future medical AI development. Solutions to mitigate bias must be implemented with care, which include the collection of large and diverse data sets, statistical debiasing methods, thorough model evaluation, emphasis on model interpretability, and standardized bias reporting and transparency requirements. Prior to real-world implementation in clinical settings, rigorous validation through clinical trials is critical to demonstrate unbiased application. Addressing biases across model development stages is crucial for ensuring all patients benefit equitably from the future of medical AI.",

    "abstract": "This manuscript serves as an introduction to a comprehensive 7-part review article series on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) and their current and future influence within pathology and medicine. This introductory review provides a comprehensive grasp of this fast-expanding realm and its potential to transform medical diagnosis, workflow, research, and education. Fundamental terminology employed in AI-ML is covered using an extensive dictionary. The article also provides a broad overview of the main domains in the AI-ML field, encompassing both generative and nongenerative (traditional) AI, thereby serving as a primer to the other 6 review articles in this series that describe the details about statistics, regulations, bias, ethical dilemmas, and ML-Ops in AI-ML. The intent of these review articles is to better equip individuals who are or will be working in an AI-enabled health care system.",

    "abstract": "Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies-such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks-to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows-namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity-critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent decision-making (IDM) is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to automate or augment decision processes. Modern IDM paradigms integrate advanced frameworks to enable intelligent agents to make effective and adaptive choices and decompose complex tasks into manageable steps, such as AI agents and high-level reinforcement learning. Recent advances in multimodal foundation-based approaches unify diverse input modalities-such as vision, language, and sensory data-into a cohesive decision-making process. Foundation models (FMs) have become pivotal in science and industry, transforming decision-making and research capabilities. Their large-scale, multimodal data-processing abilities foster adaptability and interdisciplinary breakthroughs across fields such as healthcare, life sciences, and education. This survey examines IDM's evolution, advanced paradigms with FMs and their transformative impact on decision-making across diverse scientific and industrial domains, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in building efficient, adaptive, and ethical decision systems.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) models, including Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT/GPT-4, have achieved unprecedented success in a variety of general domain tasks. Yet, when applied directly to specialized domains like medical imaging, which require in-depth expertise, these models face notable challenges arising from the medical field's inherent complexities and unique characteristics. In this review, we delve into the potential applications of AGI models in medical imaging and healthcare, with a primary focus on LLMs, Large Vision Models, and Large Multimodal Models. We provide a thorough overview of the key features and enabling techniques of LLMs and AGI, and further examine the roadmaps guiding the evolution and implementation of AGI models in the medical sector, summarizing their present applications, potentialities, and associated challenges. In addition, we highlight potential future research directions, offering a holistic view on upcoming ventures. This comprehensive review aims to offer insights into the future implications of AGI in medical imaging, healthcare, and beyond.",

    "abstract": "In the domain of using DL-based methods in medical and healthcare prediction systems, the utilization of state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) methodologies assumes paramount significance. DL has attained remarkable achievements across diverse domains, rendering its efficacy particularly noteworthy in this context. The integration of DL with health and medical prediction systems enables real-time analysis of vast and intricate datasets, yielding insights that significantly enhance healthcare outcomes and operational efficiency in the industry. This comprehensive literature review systematically investigates the latest DL solutions for the challenges encountered in medical healthcare, with a specific emphasis on DL applications in the medical domain. By categorizing cutting-edge DL approaches into distinct categories, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), long short-term memory (LSTM) models, support vector machine (SVM), and hybrid models, this study delves into their underlying principles, merits, limitations, methodologies, simulation environments, and datasets. Notably, the majority of the scrutinized articles were published in 2022, underscoring the contemporaneous nature of the research. Moreover, this review accentuates the forefront advancements in DL techniques and their practical applications within the realm of medical prediction systems, while simultaneously addressing the challenges that hinder the widespread implementation of DL in image segmentation within the medical healthcare domains. These discerned insights serve as compelling impetuses for future studies aimed at the progressive advancement of using DL-based methods in medical and health prediction systems. The evaluation metrics employed across the reviewed articles encompass a broad spectrum of features, encompassing accuracy, precision, specificity, F-score, adoptability, adaptability, and scalability.",

    "abstract": "Environmental health (EH) is a complex and interdisciplinary field dedicated to the examination of environmental behaviours, toxicological effects, health risks, and strategies for mitigating harmful environmental factors. Traditional EH research investigates correlations between risk factors and health outcomes through control variables, but this route is difficult to address complex EH issue. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology not only has accelerated the innovation of the scientific research paradigm but also has become an important tool for solving complex EH problems. However, the in-depth and comprehensive implementation of AI in the field of EH still faces many barriers, such as model generalizability, data privacy protection, algorithm transparency, and regulatory and ethical issues. This review focuses on the compound exposures of EH and explores the potential, challenges, and development directions of AI in four key phases of EH research: (1) data collection, fusion, and management, (2) hazard identification and screening, (3) risk modeling and assessment and (4) EH management. It is not difficult to see that in the future, artificial intelligence technology will inevitably carry out multidimensional simulation of complex exposure factors through multi-mode data fusion, so as to achieve accurate identification of environmental health risks, and eventually become an efficient tool for global environmental health management. This review will help researchers re-examine this strategy and provide a reference for AI to solve complex exposure problems.",
