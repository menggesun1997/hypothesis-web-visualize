    "Problem_Statement": "Most RAG implementations focus on English-language datasets, limiting NLP accuracy and clinical support for non-English speaking populations worldwide.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses an under-explored cross-lingual and domain adaptation gap by designing a multilingual RAG system integrating cross-lingual knowledge bases and adaptive prompt engineering targeting equitable clinical NLP globally.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a multilingual RAG architecture incorporating multilingual knowledge graphs and vector databases. Employ translation-aware retrieval pipelines and prompt templates tailored for language-specific clinical vernaculars, maintaining semantic alignment across languages to prevent hallucinations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect parallel clinical datasets in multiple languages. 2. Build multilingual KGs and embeddings. 3. Develop translation-aware retrieval modules. 4. Train bilingual/multilingual LLMs with aligned prompts. 5. Evaluate accuracy, hallucination rates, and clinical fidelity across languages.",

Additionally, the complexity and resource demands of building multilingual knowledge graphs and translation-aware retrieval modules need further elaboration to assess feasibility fully. I recommend augmenting the plan with concrete milestones, validation checkpoints for cross-lingual semantic alignment, and contingency steps for handling dataset scarcity or domain shifts in different languages to enhance scientific soundness and practical viability.\n\nTargeted section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating, the proposal could substantially benefit from integrating recent advances in zero-shot learning and contrastive learning to improve cross-lingual semantic alignment and reduce hallucinations. For instance, embedding contrastive learning objectives when training multilingual LLMs could enhance the model's ability to distinguish clinically relevant information across languages, improving retrieval and generation quality. Moreover, leveraging few-shot learning techniques on localized electronic health records or Named Entity Recognition datasets could help customize the system more effectively to specific clinical vocabularies and vernaculars, increasing impact and robustness. This cross-pollination with globally linked concepts can push the work beyond incremental novelty toward a more transformative contribution.\n\nTargeted section: Proposed_Method"
