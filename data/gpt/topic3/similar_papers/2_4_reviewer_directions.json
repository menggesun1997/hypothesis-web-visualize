    "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Cognitive Semantic Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current retrieval filtering does not leverage cognitive science-inspired semantic filters, limiting interpretability and relevance in medical NLP applications.",
    "Motivation": "Exploits the hidden bridge linking cognitive science and retrieval mechanisms by integrating cognitive semantic filtering layers based on human concept categorization and memory models to enhance retrieval precision and reduce irrelevant or hallucinated content.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a cognitive semantic filter module that scores candidate retrievals by semantic congruence with the prompt, guided by models of human semantic memory (e.g., spreading activation, semantic networks). Integrate this filtering step before generation in RAG pipelines for medical queries.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select behavioral therapy and medical Q&A datasets. 2. Implement semantic memory-inspired filter using graph traversal and embedding similarities. 3. Compare RAG with and without cognitive filtering. 4. Use metrics: retrieval precision, clinical relevance, hallucination rate. 5. Conduct user studies measuring interpretability and trust.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Explain usage of CBT techniques in anxiety.\" Output: Generation based only on tightly semantically filtered, relevant documents improving factuality and alignment with therapeutic concepts.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If filter is too restrictive, tune semantic thresholds or augment with learned similarity functions trained on expert annotations."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines integrating a cognitive semantic filter inspired by human semantic memory models (e.g., spreading activation, semantic networks), but it lacks sufficient detail about how these cognitive principles will concretely translate into computational procedures within the RAG pipeline. Clarify the precise algorithmic implementation (e.g., how graph traversal will be combined with embedding similarity scores) and how semantic congruence scoring balances between cognitive plausibility and computational efficiency. This clarity is needed to assess the methodâ€™s soundness and reproducibility reliably, especially in the medical domain where precision is critical and interpretability claims are made. Consider providing pseudocode or a diagram to strengthen the methodological exposition in the main proposal section 'Proposed_Method'. Also, explain how the filter avoids overly restrictive exclusion of relevant documents that may use varied terminologies or synonyms common in medical texts rather than only exact semantic fits, beyond just the Fallback_Plan tuning strategy. This mechanistic transparency is key for peer reviewers and practitioners assessing feasibility and impact potential in clinical NLP contexts, where filtering precision impacts trust and safety directly.  \n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict of NOV-COMPETITIVE, the idea can gain stronger impact and novelty by integrating recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) and multi-modal representation learning to enhance the cognitive semantic filter. Specifically, reformulate the semantic memory-inspired filter using graph neural networks operating over knowledge graphs constructed from medical ontologies and semantic networks. This allows learned, end-to-end optimized filtering rather than rule-based or fixed heuristic filtering. Additionally, incorporate joint latent spaces combining textual embeddings and structured domain knowledge (e.g., clinical concept embeddings), which leverages multi-modal representation learning paradigms to improve semantic congruence scoring beyond text-only similarity measures. These integrations would align with globally trending concepts like 'graph neural networks', 'multi-modal representation learning', and 'joint latent space'. Such refinement will boost the feasibility, interpretability, and precision of the filtering mechanism, improve downstream generation factuality, and distinguish the work from existing RAG filtering approaches, addressing the competitive novelty landscape effectively.\n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"
