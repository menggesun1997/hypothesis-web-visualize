    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence is set to revolutionize healthcare delivery by transforming traditional patient care into a more personalized, efficient, and proactive process. Chatbots, serving as interactive conversational models, will probably drive this patient-centered transformation in healthcare. Through the provision of various services, including diagnosis, personalized lifestyle recommendations, dynamic scheduling of follow-ups, and mental health support, the objective is to substantially augment patient health outcomes, all the while mitigating the workload burden on healthcare providers. The life-critical nature of healthcare applications necessitates establishing a unified and comprehensive set of evaluation metrics for conversational models. Existing evaluation metrics proposed for various generic large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a lack of comprehension regarding medical and health concepts and their significance in promoting patients’ well-being. Moreover, these metrics neglect pivotal user-centered aspects, including trust-building, ethics, personalization, empathy, user comprehension, and emotional support. The purpose of this paper is to explore state-of-the-art LLM-based evaluation metrics that are specifically applicable to the assessment of interactive conversational models in healthcare. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics designed to thoroughly assess the performance of healthcare chatbots from an end-user perspective. These metrics encompass an evaluation of language processing abilities, impact on real-world clinical tasks, and effectiveness in user-interactive conversations. Finally, we engage in a discussion concerning the challenges associated with defining and implementing these metrics, with particular emphasis on confounding factors such as the target audience, evaluation methods, and prompt techniques involved in the evaluation process.",

    "title": "Evaluating ChatGPT-4's Performance in Identifying Radiological Anatomy in FRCR Part 1 Examination Questions",
    "year": 2024,
    "citationCount": 4,
    "fieldCitationRatio": 0.0,
    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>  Radiology is critical for diagnosis and patient care, relying heavily on accurate image interpretation. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have raised interest in the potential of AI models to support radiologists, although robust research on AI performance in this field is still emerging. <b>Objective</b>  This study aimed to assess the efficacy of ChatGPT-4 in answering radiological anatomy questions similar to those in the Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR) Part 1 Anatomy examination. <b>Materials and Methods</b>  We used 100 mock radiological anatomy questions from a free Web site patterned after the FRCR Part 1 Anatomy examination. ChatGPT-4 was tested under two conditions: with and without context regarding the examination instructions and question format. The main query posed was: \"Identify the structure indicated by the arrow(s).\" Responses were evaluated against correct answers, and two expert radiologists (&gt;5 and 30 years of experience in radiology diagnostics and academics) rated the explanation of the answers. We calculated four scores: correctness, sidedness, modality identification, and approximation. The latter considers partial correctness if the identified structure is present but not the focus of the question. <b>Results</b>  Both testing conditions saw ChatGPT-4 underperform, with correctness scores of 4 and 7.5% for no context and with context, respectively. However, it identified the imaging modality with 100% accuracy. The model scored over 50% on the approximation metric, where it identified present structures not indicated by the arrow. However, it struggled with identifying the correct side of the structure, scoring approximately 42 and 40% in the no context and with context settings, respectively. Only 32% of the responses were similar across the two settings. <b>Conclusion</b>  Despite its ability to correctly recognize the imaging modality, ChatGPT-4 has significant limitations in interpreting normal radiological anatomy. This indicates the necessity for enhanced training in normal anatomy to better interpret abnormal radiological images. Identifying the correct side of structures in radiological images also remains a challenge for ChatGPT-4.",

    "abstract": "This review explores the role of prompt engineering in unleashing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Prompt engineering is the process of structuring inputs, and it has emerged as a crucial technique for maximizing the utility and accuracy of these models. Both foundational and advanced prompt engineering methodologies-including techniques such as self-consistency, chain of thought, and generated knowledge, which can significantly enhance the performance of models-are explored in this paper. Additionally, the prompt methods for vision language models (VLMs) are examined in detail. Prompt methods are evaluated with subjective and objective metrics, ensuring a robust analysis of their efficacy. Critical to this discussion is the role of prompt engineering in artificial intelligence (AI) security, particularly in terms of defending against adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs. Strategies for minimizing these risks and improving the robustness of models are thoroughly reviewed. Finally, we provide a perspective for future research and applications.",

    "abstract": "This review paper aims to serve as a comprehensive guide and instructional resource for researchers seeking to effectively implement language models in medical imaging research. First, we presented the fundamental principles and evolution of language models, dedicating particular attention to large language models. We then reviewed the current literature on how language models are being used to improve medical imaging, emphasizing a range of applications such as image captioning, report generation, report classification, findings extraction, visual question response systems, interpretable diagnosis and so on. Notably, the capabilities of ChatGPT were spotlighted for researchers to explore its further applications. Furthermore, we covered the advantageous impacts of accurate and efficient language models in medical imaging analysis, such as the enhancement of clinical workflow efficiency, reduction of diagnostic errors, and assistance of clinicians in providing timely and accurate diagnoses. Overall, our goal is to have better integration of language models with medical imaging, thereby inspiring new ideas and innovations. It is our aspiration that this review can serve as a useful resource for researchers in this field, stimulating continued investigative and innovative pursuits of the application of language models in medical imaging.",

    "abstract": "This review paper synthesizes the application of knowledge graphs (KGs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, based on two basic questions, as follows: what types of input data are available to construct these knowledge graphs, and what purpose the knowledge graph is intended to fulfill. We synthesize results from existing works to illustrate how diverse knowledge graph structures behave in different data availability settings with distinct application targets in AD research. By comparative analysis, we define the best methodology practices by data type (literature, structured databases, neuroimaging, and clinical records) and application of interest (drug repurposing, disease classification, mechanism discovery, and clinical decision support). From this analysis, we recommend AD-KG 2.0, which is a new framework that coalesces best practices into a unifying architecture with well-defined decision pathways for implementation. Our key contributions are as follows: (1) a dynamic adaptation mechanism that adapts methodological elements automatically according to both data availability and application objectives, (2) a specialized semantic alignment layer that harmonizes terminologies across biological scales, and (3) a multi-constraint optimization approach for knowledge graph building. The framework accommodates a variety of applications, including drug repurposing, patient stratification for precision medicine, disease progression modeling, and clinical decision support. Our system, with a decision tree structured and pipeline layered architecture, offers research precise directions on how to use knowledge graphs in AD research by aligning methodological choice decisions with respective data availability and application goals. We provide precise component designs and adaptation processes that deliver optimal performance across varying research and clinical settings. We conclude by addressing implementation challenges and future directions for translating knowledge graph technologies from research tool to clinical use, with a specific focus on interpretability, workflow integration, and regulatory matters.",

    "abstract": "This review examines the use of large language models (LLMs) in cancer, analysing articles sourced from PubMed, Embase, and Ovid Medline, published between 2017 and 2024. Our search strategy included terms related to LLMs, cancer research, risks, safeguards, and ethical issues, focusing on studies that utilized text-based data. 59 articles were included in the review, categorized into 3 segments: quantitative studies on LLMs, chatbot-focused studies, and qualitative discussions on LLMs on cancer. Quantitative studies highlight LLMs' advanced capabilities in natural language processing (NLP), while chatbot-focused articles demonstrate their potential in clinical support and data management. Qualitative research underscores the broader implications of LLMs, including the risks and ethical considerations. Our findings suggest that LLMs, notably ChatGPT, have potential in data analysis, patient interaction, and personalized treatment in cancer care. However, the review identifies critical risks, including data biases and ethical challenges. We emphasize the need for regulatory oversight, targeted model development, and continuous evaluation. In conclusion, integrating LLMs in cancer research offers promising prospects but necessitates a balanced approach focusing on accuracy, ethical integrity, and data privacy. This review underscores the need for further study, encouraging responsible exploration and application of artificial intelligence in oncology.",

    "year": 2024,
    "citationCount": 9,

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in natural language processing, computational linguistics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have propelled the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Automated Essay Scoring (AES), offering efficient and unbiased writing assessment. This study assesses the reliability of LLMs in AES tasks, focusing on scoring consistency and alignment with human raters. We explore the impact of prompt engineering, temperature settings, and multi-level rating dimensions on the scoring performance of LLMs. Results indicate that prompt engineering significantly affects the reliability of LLMs, with GPT-4 showing marked improvement over GPT-3.5 and Claude 2, achieving 112% and 114% increase in scoring accuracy under the criteria and sample-referenced justification prompt. Temperature settings also influence the output consistency of LLMs, with lower temperatures producing scores more in line with human evaluations, which is essential for maintaining fairness in large-scale assessment. Regarding multi-dimensional writing assessment, results indicate that GPT-4 performs well in dimensions regarding <i>Ideas</i> (QWK=0.551) and <i>Organization</i> (QWK=0.584) under well-crafted prompt engineering. These findings pave the way for a comprehensive exploration of LLMs' broader educational implications, offering insights into their capability to refine and potentially transform writing instruction, assessment, and the delivery of diagnostic and personalized feedback in the AI-powered educational age. While this study attached importance to the reliability and alignment of LLM-powered multi-dimensional AES, future research should broaden its scope to encompass diverse writing genres and a more extensive sample from varied backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Mapping the interactions between pharmaceutical compounds and their molecular targets is a fundamental aspect of drug discovery and repurposing. Drug-target interactions are important for elucidating mechanisms of action and optimizing drug efficacy and safety profiles. Several computational methods have been developed to systematically predict drug-target interactions. However, computational and experimental validation of the drug-target predictions greatly vary across the studies.\nAREAS COVERED: Through a PubMed query, a corpus comprising 3,286 articles on drug-target interaction prediction published within the past decade was covered. Natural language processing was used for automated abstract classification to study the evolution of computational methods, validation strategies and performance assessment metrics in the 3,286 articles. Additionally, a manual analysis of 259 studies that performed experimental validation of computational predictions revealed prevalent experimental protocols.\nEXPERT OPINION: Starting from 2014, there has been a noticeable increase in articles focusing on drug-target interaction prediction. Docking and regression stands out as the most commonly used techniques among computational methods, and cross-validation is frequently employed as the computational validation strategy. Testing the predictions using multiple, orthogonal validation strategies is recommended and should be reported for the specific target prediction applications. Experimental validation remains relatively rare and should be performed more routinely to evaluate biological relevance of predictions.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are sophisticated AI-driven models trained on vast sources of natural language data. They are adept at generating responses that closely mimic human conversational patterns. One of the most notable examples is OpenAI's ChatGPT, which has been extensively used across diverse sectors. Despite their flexibility, a significant challenge arises as most users must transmit their data to the servers of companies operating these models. Utilizing ChatGPT or similar models online may inadvertently expose sensitive information to the risk of data breaches. Therefore, implementing LLMs that are open source and smaller in scale within a secure local network becomes a crucial step for organizations where ensuring data privacy and protection has the highest priority, such as regulatory agencies. As a feasibility evaluation, we implemented a series of open-source LLMs within a regulatory agency's local network and assessed their performance on specific tasks involving extracting relevant clinical pharmacology information from regulatory drug labels. Our research shows that some models work well in the context of few- or zero-shot learning, achieving performance comparable, or even better than, neural network models that needed thousands of training samples. One of the models was selected to address a real-world issue of finding intrinsic factors that affect drugs' clinical exposure without any training or fine-tuning. In a dataset of over 700 000 sentences, the model showed a 78.5% accuracy rate. Our work pointed to the possibility of implementing open-source LLMs within a secure local network and using these models to perform various natural language processing tasks when large numbers of training examples are unavailable.",
