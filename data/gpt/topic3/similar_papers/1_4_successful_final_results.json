        "title": "Explainable Multimodal Fusion of Wearable Sensor and Visual Data for Robust LLM Decision Support in Safety-Critical Healthcare",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in robustly integrating and interpreting heterogeneous multimodal data—specifically textual, wearable sensor, and imaging inputs—in safety-critical healthcare environments, where transparent reasoning and resistance to noisy inputs are paramount.",
        "Motivation": "While prior works integrate multimodal inputs into LLMs using multi-headed attention or prototype-based explanations, they often lack explicit balancing between robustness and interpretability, especially with wearable sensor data fused alongside clinical texts and images. This gap is critical in healthcare, where explainability under uncertainty drives trust and adoption. Our approach innovatively incorporates wearable sensor-based human activity recognition as a complementary modality to clinical imaging and text, embedding domain-specialized rule extraction into intermediate reasoning layers. This fusion, coupled with explanation modules grounded in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and validated by domain experts, synergizes robustness and interpretability, advancing beyond existing competitive methods.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular architecture with four main components: (1) Modality Encoders — pretrained textual LLM layers, convolutional neural networks (CNN) for imaging, and transformer-based encoders for wearable sensor time-series capturing human activity recognition features; (2) Cross-Modal Fusion Module — a carefully designed multi-headed attention mechanism that performs hierarchical fusion with explicit noise-robustness regularization (e.g., adversarial noise injections during training) to enhance resilience; accompanied by schematic pseudocode and workflow diagrams detailed below; (3) Interpretable Reasoning Trace Module — integrates domain-specialized rule extraction trained via supervised and weakly-supervised approaches on annotated clinical cases, producing intermediate explanations represented as symbolic rules that map fused embeddings to decision rationales; this module’s outputs form transparent explanation paths; (4) Decision and Explanation Generator — combines reasoning traces with final predictions, returning both outputs and human-understandable rationales. We further incorporate prototype-based explanation declustering to benchmark and justify the choice of rule-based vs. attention-only methods. Robustness is quantified via explicit metrics on perturbed inputs, and interpretability via metrics derived from expert-validated explanation fidelity and comprehensibility. Comprehensive pseudocode and architectural flowcharts accompany the method to ensure reproducibility and clarity.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Domain Focus and Data Acquisition: Concentrate on the healthcare domain, securing collaboration with clinical partners and access to a standardized multimodal dataset comprising clinical text, medical imaging, and wearable sensor data for human activity recognition with synchronized annotations. 2. Data Preprocessing and Annotation: Preprocess and align modalities; annotate sensor events and imaging findings to support rule extraction training. 3. Model Development: Implement and train modality encoders; develop the proposed fusion and interpretable reasoning trace modules with robustness regularization strategies. 4. Baseline Comparisons: Compare with state-of-the-art unimodal LLMs, black-box multimodal fusions, and prototype-based explainers to empirically validate improvements. 5. Robustness Evaluation: Introduce controlled noise models—Gaussian noise on sensor inputs, simulated artifact corruptions on images, and syntactic perturbations in text—to measure resilience. 6. Interpretability Assessment: Conduct structured user studies involving clinicians who will rate generated explanations on transparency, trustworthiness, and utility. Quantify interpretability using metrics such as explanation fidelity, completeness, and user satisfaction scores. 7. Iterative Refinement and Fallbacks: Based on pilot results, if training fusion impedes convergence, pivot to late fusion via modality experts with separate explainers; or simplify interpretable module by integrating post-hoc attribution methods validated against clinical relevance. Timelines, resource allocations, and risk mitigation plans are detailed and scoped realistically to ensure feasibility within the project duration.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Case 1 Input: Patient clinical notes combined with simultaneous wearable sensor recordings (heart rate, motion data) and chest X-ray images. Output: Diagnostic suggestion (e.g., pneumonia suspicion) with an explanation tracing sensor anomalies (e.g., decreased activity), textual symptom correlations, and imaging features, clearly mapped with symbolic rules. Case 2 Input: Real-time text alerts and wearable sensor data from a patient at risk of cardiac events. Output: Personalized action recommendations with detailed rationale citing sensor irregularities, prior textual reports, and imaging history, supported by transparent intermediate reasoning traces suitable for clinical audit.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should multi-headed attention fusion prove unstable or fail to converge in training, shift to a late fusion approach assembling separate modality-specific experts whose outputs are combined via weighted voting or gating mechanisms. In the interpretable reasoning module, if domain-specialized rule extraction becomes too complex or data-hungry, fallback to prototype-based explanations integrated post-hoc through similarity mapping, or classical XAI techniques like SHAP or LIME adapted for each modality, ensuring minimal loss of interpretability. These fallbacks will preserve core goals of explainability and robustness with lower complexity and improved feasibility."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method, while ambitious in integrating multimodal data via multi-headed attention fusion and interpretable reasoning traces, lacks detailed clarity on how robustness and interpretability are concretely balanced or quantified within the architecture. For example, it is unclear how domain-specialized rule extraction modules are designed or trained, or how intermediate reasoning traces are validated. Providing a more precise architectural workflow, highlighting how each module contributes to robustness against noisy inputs and transparency for end users, would improve soundness and reproducibility of the approach. Consider including schematic diagrams or pseudocode to elucidate the fusion and explainer interactions, along with theoretical or empirical justifications for chosen mechanisms over strong baseline alternatives in the literature (e.g., prototype-based explanation methods or attention-only fusion). This clarity is essential for the community to assess and build upon the approach confidently and may prevent issues during experimentation or deployment in safety-critical environments like power systems or healthcare.

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is comprehensive but ambitious and leaves some practical feasibility questions open. For instance, the data collection/assembly step across two very different domains (power dispatch and clinical diagnostics) requires access to diverse, potentially sensitive, and high-quality multimodal datasets with synchronized sensor-text-image modalities, which may be challenging and time-consuming. Additionally, robustness testing via noisy inputs and interpretability evaluation via user studies are outlined but need more fleshing out on experimental protocols, e.g., what noise models will be used? How will interpretability scores be quantified and validated with real domain experts? Budgeting for iterative model training and fallback adaptations also seems optimistic given the multi-domain scope and complexity of the architecture. To improve feasibility, the authors should consider focusing on a single domain first, ensure access to domain partners and appropriate datasets up front, and define more precise, operationalized interpretability and robustness metrics. Clarifying timelines and resource requirements related to each experimental step would strengthen the plan's credibility and increase likelihood of successful execution.
