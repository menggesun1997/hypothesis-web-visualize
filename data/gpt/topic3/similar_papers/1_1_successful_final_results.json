        "title": "Human-Centered Adaptive LLM Training Using Multi-Modal Cognitive Feedback and Explainability for Enhanced Human-AI Synergy",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current domain-specific fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) often relies on static, offline methods that do not reflect real-time user cognitive and affective states, limiting adaptability, interpretability, and alignment with end-user needs. Additionally, emerging human-in-the-loop methodologies are challenged by noisy, modality-specific signals and lack explainability mechanisms that dynamically tailor interaction based on user mental workload and affect.",
        "Motivation": "While existing works explore LLM fine-tuning and human-in-the-loop models separately, our approach uniquely integrates multi-modal human cognitive feedback—including EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) signals supplemented with human-robot interaction (HRI) cues like eye-tracking and gesture recognition—to adaptively and transparently fine-tune LLMs in real time. This synthesis addresses interpretability, robustness, and user trust by dynamically adjusting both model parameters and explanation complexity in response to rich, cross-validated user state data. By building a rigorous, validated pipeline for signal processing, cognitive state decoding, and parameter mapping, we overcome key feasibility challenges and position the work beyond competitive novelty baselines with a unified framework for robust, explainable, human-centered AI in NLP and interactive agent contexts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel adaptive LLM fine-tuning framework regulated by a multi-modal human cognitive feedback loop, combining EEG-based BCI physiological signals and complementary human-robot interaction modalities (eye-tracking, gesture recognition) for enhanced robustness. The pipeline includes: (1) rigorous EEG preprocessing and artifact rejection leveraging state-of-the-art spike sorting and neural recording techniques, with concurrent behavioral data fusion to verify cognitive-affective state decoding accuracy; (2) quantitative metrics translating decoded mental workload and affective states into concrete hyperparameter adjustments such as dynamic learning rates, selective parameter focus, and interaction modality selection; (3) an explainability module that uses real-time user state data to modulate the complexity and style of model-generated explanations, improving interpretability and user trust; (4) iterative pilot studies and computational simulations using synthetic and proxy data to validate system stability and controller efficacy before full human trials; (5) expert collaboration with BCI and ML specialists to ensure rigorous signal-model integration protocols and fallback mechanisms employing physiological proxies like heart rate variability when BCI signals degrade. This integrated multi-sensor fusion approach uniquely enables robust, transparent, and context-aware adaptation of LLMs, thus positioning the work at the frontier of human-centered, explainable AI and human-AI interaction.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop and validate EEG preprocessing pipeline with artifact rejection and spike sorting modules, establishing signal-to-noise baselines using pilot data from domain experts. 2. Simultaneously collect multi-modal HRI data (eye-tracking, gestures) during NLP task performance to enable fusion-based cognitive state decoding and cross-validation. 3. Quantify relationships between decoded mental workload/affect and LLM hyperparameters through computational simulations, refining parameter update mappings. 4. Implement an adaptive controller integrating these mappings, dynamically adjusting fine-tuning processes and explanation complexity in a prototype interactive system. 5. Conduct controlled human-in-the-loop pilot studies with domain experts, measuring signal quality, system stability, user satisfaction, task success rates, and trust indicators. 6. Analyze control robustness and fallback strategies under signal noise or dropout conditions. 7. Iterate on system design with BCI and ML expert feedback to optimize empirical rigor and reproducibility, preparing for scale-up to realistic, time-sensitive deployment scenarios.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "- Input: Domain expert poses complex real-time query under EEG, eye-tracking, and gesture monitoring; mental workload inferred to be high and negative affect detected. Output: LLM dynamically simplifies explanations, reduces output complexity, and prioritizes key domain concepts while transparently showing rationale to reduce cognitive load.\n- Input: User exhibits low mental workload and positive affect signals combined with confirmatory gaze patterns. Output: Model increases interaction richness, offering deeper elaborations and alternative perspectives with detailed, tailored explanations enhancing user engagement.\n- Input: BCI signals degrade; system seamlessly compensates by increasing reliance on gesture and eye-tracking cues, and falls back to adaptive user explicit feedback mechanisms without disrupting interaction flow.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If EEG-based BCI signals prove too noisy or unstable in real time, the system will dynamically increase weighting of complementary modalities such as eye-tracking and gesture recognition from the human-robot interaction sensors to maintain reliable cognitive state decoding. Additionally, explicit user feedback channels and physiological proxies (e.g., heart rate variability) will be integrated as secondary fallback mechanisms. Synthetic and proxy dataset-driven simulations will continuously refine fallback and controller adjustments. Expert collaboration ensures fallback strategies are methodologically rigorous and that unstable or noisy real-time adjustments trigger safe gradual model adaptation policies to maintain system robustness and user trust while preserving interpretability and performance."

          "feedback_content": "The experiment plan could face significant practical challenges that may undermine feasibility. Recruiting domain experts with EEG-based BCI devices and reliably collecting clean cognitive load data in realistic NLP task interactions is complex and resource-intensive. Moreover, the protocol lacks details on validation of the BCI signal quality, artifact rejection, and how cognitive and affective states will be quantitatively integrated to dynamically adjust multiple training parameters (learning rates, parameter focus, interaction modalities). It is recommended to include intermediate validation steps for the BCI data pipeline, consider pilot studies to verify signal-to-noise ratio, and computational simulations to test the adaptive controller before deploying the full human-in-the-loop training loop. Also, clarify how user mental states directly inform concrete model parameter updates to enhance empirical rigor and reproducibility in this interdisciplinary setup, which currently risks being overly ambitious without detailed mitigation of these challenges. This enhancement will strengthen the confidence in scientific rigor and operational feasibility of the proposed experiments and training approach, crucial for delivering meaningful results in time-sensitive conference contexts and ensuring broad adoption potential in downstream applications involving human-AI synergy in NLP/LLMs environments.  This is critical to address prior to subsequent novelty or impact concerns given the system's multi-modal complexity and the known challenges in real-time BCI data usage in adaptive training loops for LLMs.  \n\nSuggested improvements: \n- Add precise methodology for EEG data preprocessing and cognitive state decoding. \n- Define quantitative metrics for how mental workload and affective feedback map onto training hyperparameters. \n- Pilot or synthetic data experiments prior to human trials.\n- Contingency planning if real-time adjustment is unstable or noisy. \n- Collaboration with BCI and ML experts for signal and model update protocols. \n\nThis approach will increase the likelihood of successful implementation and reliable empirical validation of the novel feedback-regulated LLM fine-tuning system with real-time human cognitive state input, positioning the work better for acceptance and downstream impact in competitive human-centered AI conferences or venues focused on LLM advancement and human-in-the-loop machine learning integrations.  \n\nNote: This feedback addresses feasibility rigor, which is a fundamental prerequisite preceding the further impact scaling or mechanism elaboration stages, thus is prioritized first in this review set.  \n\n\n\n"

This multi-modal approach could robustly complement noisy BCI data and align the system better with complex real-world human-centered environments.\n\nConcretely, these integrations could facilitate:\n- Real-time adjustment of explanation complexity triggered by detected user cognitive load or affective state.\n- Cross-modal feedback loops that validate and refine BCI-based signals with behavioral measures from other human-robot interaction sensors.\n- Broader applicability beyond NLP tasks toward interactive AI agents in multi-modal communication settings.\n\nThis cross-disciplinary synthesis not only addresses current feasibility and impact limitations but also carves a clearer novelty niche by combining adaptive LLM training with explainability and enriched human-AI interaction channels in a unified framework. It would make the research highly relevant to top-tier venues concerned with human-centered AI, explainability, and robust interactive systems, reinforcing scientific and practical value while differentiating the work from existing competitive baselines."
