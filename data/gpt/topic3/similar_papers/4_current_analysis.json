Core focus areas include managing large parameter sizes and leveraging deep learning-based architectures such as transformers, recurrent neural networks, and hybrid models. The dominant methods within this field encompass data distillation techniques to reduce model size without significant performance degradation, federated learning integration to enable privacy-preserving distributed model training, and hybrid self-attentive architectures enhancing contextual understanding and explainability. Thematic islands show a division between intrusion detection models (with emphasis on deep learning architectures), clinical information extraction (leveraging synthetic data distillation for scalable, cost-effective deployments), and challenges related to parameter size impacting task generalization and resource constraints. Bridge nodes like 'data distillation' and 'information extraction' illustrate efforts to connect model compression with practical extraction tasks, signaling a methodological focus on scaling down LLMs efficiently without loss of critical performance.",
