    "title": "Hybrid Actor–Critic Prompting Coupled with Real-Time Filtered Retrieval for Medical NLP",
    "Problem_Statement": "Separately applied advanced prompting and retrieval methods have not been systematically optimized together, leaving a gap in achieving high accuracy and interpretability in high-stakes medical NLP tasks.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap related to the under-explored integration of prompt engineering and retrieval strategies. Novelty lies in tightly coupling actor–critic style prompt optimization with a dynamically filtered retrieval process, leveraging the 'language model' bridge node for end-to-end system optimization.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a hybrid architecture where an actor module generates candidate prompts, a critic module evaluates generated outputs based on clinical fidelity, and a retrieval module filters and supplies contextually relevant domain documents in real-time. The language model is fine-tuned jointly using reinforcement learning to maximize accuracy and interpretability metrics concurrently.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use medical Q&A datasets, e.g., rheumatology and behavioral therapy clinical queries. 2. Implement actor–critic prompting algorithms integrated with a retrieval pipeline querying vector databases with semantic filters. 3. Baselines: separate RAG, prompt-only optimized LLMs. 4. Metrics: clinical accuracy, interpretability, retrieval precision, hallucination rate. 5. Evaluate on unseen clinical contexts and measure robustness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Explain side effects of common CBT medications.\" Output: Accurate explanation supported by filtered retrieval results, with clearly attributable knowledge and minimal hallucination, alongside interpretability rationale from critic feedback.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If joint training proves unstable, decouple training stages with meta-learning or curriculum learning. Alternatively, employ human evaluation to recalibrate critic reward signals."

          "feedback_content": "The problem statement assumes that a joint optimization of actor-critic prompting with real-time filtered retrieval will yield improved accuracy and interpretability in medical NLP tasks; however, it does not sufficiently justify why existing separate or sequential approaches fail or where the joint coupling specifically addresses critical shortcomings. Clarify and support these assumptions experimentally or theoretically to strengthen the soundness of the approach, particularly in a high-stakes domain like healthcare where errors carry significant risks, and accuracy trade-offs are sensitive to prompt/retrieval interplay nuances. Also, ensure that the assumption that clinical fidelity can be effectively captured by a critic module's reward signal is realistic and grounded in domain expertise or empirical validation frameworks that account for subtle clinical knowledge nuances and hallucination risks inherent in language models in medical contexts. Strengthening these assumptions would make the proposed methodology more credible and targeted to the unmet needs stated in the problem statement."

        {
          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The experiment plan appears comprehensive but could face feasibility challenges in the joint reinforcement learning (RL) setup, as RL is often unstable especially in combined actor-critic architectures with external retrieval components in medical NLP where labeled clinical fidelity feedback is scarce and expensive. The fallback plan to decouple training or rely on human evaluators is good but should be more explicitly detailed upfront with clear success/failure criteria. Additionally, clarify and justify the choice of datasets for clinical representativeness and the practical approach for retrieval filtering semantics and precision metrics in real-time settings. Without more concrete detail, the proposed method’s feasibility risks being undermined by unstable training, insufficient data for high-quality rewards, or mismatch in evaluation metrics that may fail to capture critical clinical accuracy and interpretability trade-offs. Propose more concrete steps to overcome these challenges, such as simulated environments or domain-expert-in-the-loop proxies early in training."
