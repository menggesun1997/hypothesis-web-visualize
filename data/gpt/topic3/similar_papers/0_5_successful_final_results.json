    "title": "Unified Evaluation Framework Incorporating Ethics and Trust Dimensions for Medical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing evaluation metrics for medical NLP models primarily focus on accuracy and neglect critical user-centered parameters such as ethics, empathy, and trustworthiness, resulting in deficient assessments that limit clinical adoption.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to internal gap #1 about insufficient evaluation metrics integrating user-centered factors, and the identified need for unified evaluation frameworks bridging fragmented methodologies centered on 'artificial intelligence,' 'natural language processing,' and 'AI performance.'",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a comprehensive evaluation framework combining quantitative NLP metrics (precision, recall), fairness audits, ethical compliance checks (e.g., bias, misinformation detection), and trust measures derived from user studies. The framework operationalizes these dimensions into standardized benchmarks for medical LLMs, supporting both simulated scenarios and real clinical conversations, complemented by open-source tooling for easy adoption.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Survey existing evaluation tools and user-centered parameters.\n2. Design multi-tier evaluation criteria with clear operational definitions.\n3. Develop datasets annotated for ethical and trust-related attributes.\n4. Implement automated and human-in-the-loop evaluation pipelines.\n5. Apply the framework to leading medical LLMs across tasks.\n6. Validate correlation between framework scores and physician acceptance.\n7. Release framework and benchmarks to the community.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM-generated response to a patient query containing ambiguous prognosis information.\nExpected Output: Evaluation scores reflecting content accuracy, ethical standards (non-misleading), empathy levels, and trust indicators, with detailed diagnostics highlighting potential issues.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If formalizing ethics/trust metrics proves difficult, start with proxy measures like bias audits and factuality checks. Gradually incorporate more complex human-centered assessments through iterative refinement."

        "title": "Unified Evaluation Framework Incorporating Ethics, Trust, and Technology Adoption Dimensions for Medical LLMs with Focus on Critical Mental Health Applications",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing evaluation metrics for medical NLP models largely emphasize accuracy and standard computational benchmarks, yet they insufficiently capture critical user-centered parameters such as ethics, empathy, trustworthiness, and technology acceptance—factors pivotal for meaningful clinical adoption, especially in sensitive domains like mental health care and suicide prevention.",
        "Motivation": "This work addresses internal gap #1 on insufficient evaluation frameworks integrating user-centered factors, and responds directly to the NOV-COMPETITIVE verdict by advancing beyond fragmented assessment approaches. By explicitly bridging evaluation metrics with global human-centered concepts—namely technology acceptance models, human-in-the-loop systems, and the unique ethical and trust challenges of mental health AI—we aim to deliver a distinctly impactful, clinically relevant framework. This integrated approach is designed to foster both rigorous benchmarking and enhanced real-world trust and uptake among diverse clinical populations, particularly mental health practitioners working in suicide prevention counseling.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a rigorous, multi-dimensional evaluation framework for medical LLMs that synthesizes traditional NLP metrics (precision, recall) with comprehensive ethical assessments (bias detection, misinformation, empathetic response quality), trustworthiness metrics informed by user studies, and explicit technology acceptance measures tailored for clinical adoption. The framework will incorporate insights from human-in-the-loop mental health systems and suicide prevention counseling to tailor ethics and trust criteria specific to high-stakes mental health contexts. This includes integration of validated survey instruments from technology acceptance models capturing clinician trust, perceived usefulness, and acceptance, as well as automated and manual assessments that reflect these dimensions. The framework will be operationalized through standardized benchmarks, specialty datasets, and open-source tooling to enable repeatable, multi-context evaluations, supporting both simulated and real clinical interactions with an emphasis on mental health applications.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Conduct comprehensive review of existing evaluation tools, ethics, trust, and technology acceptance models in medical AI, with emphasis on mental health and suicide prevention contexts.\n2. Design multi-tiered evaluation criteria including: NLP accuracy, ethical compliance (bias, misinformation, empathy), trustworthiness, and technology acceptance dimensions, with clearly operationalized and validated measurement instruments.\n3. Develop detailed annotation protocols for datasets capturing ethical and trust attributes, involving domain experts (clinicians, mental health specialists) to minimize subjectivity and annotator bias; employ iterative pilot annotation phases to train annotators and calculate inter-annotator agreement metrics ensuring reliability.\n4. Assemble specialized datasets incorporating simulated and real-world clinical dialogues in mental health scenarios, especially suicide prevention counseling, annotated according to the developed protocols.\n5. Build combined automated and human-in-the-loop evaluation pipelines incorporating NLP metrics, ethical and trust assessments, and clinician-centered technology acceptance surveys.\n6. Execute multi-phase user studies with diverse healthcare professionals, focusing on mental health practitioners, to validate correlations between framework scores and physician acceptance, perceived trust, and real-world uptake; implement phased milestones and remote, scalable study designs to manage resource constraints.\n7. Iteratively refine the framework based on feedback and empirical results.\n8. Publicly release the framework, annotated datasets, and tooling to encourage community adoption and further validation across domains.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM-generated supportive counseling response to a patient presenting suicidal ideation.\nExpected Output: A multi-dimensional evaluation report detailing: (a) accuracy and clinical relevance, (b) ethical compliance including non-judgmental, empathetic language, (c) trustworthiness indicators informed by both automated signal detection and clinician ratings, and (d) technology acceptance metrics reflecting mental health professional willingness to adopt based on standardized TAM surveys. Detailed diagnostic feedback highlights any detected ethical concerns, trust violations, or acceptance barriers.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If formalizing complex ethics and trust annotations proves infeasible, prioritize proxy measures such as bias audits, factuality checks, and automated empathy scoring, while developing lightweight, structured clinician feedback collection mechanisms. Incrementally incorporate technology acceptance surveys in successive study phases to gradually build validation evidence. Employ phased milestones and modular tooling to maintain forward progress under resource constraints."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan covers a comprehensive and well-structured approach, several key feasibility challenges require attention. Specifically, developing datasets annotated for ethical and trust attributes (Step 3) is notoriously difficult due to subjective interpretations, potential annotator bias, and scarcity of gold standards. It would strengthen the plan to include detailed annotation protocols, inter-annotator agreement strategies, and consideration of domain expert involvement to ensure quality. Additionally, validating correlations between framework scores and physician acceptance (Step 6) may require extensive user studies with diverse clinical populations, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. Specifying contingency plans or phased milestones to address these logistical constraints would enhance the plan's practicality and increase confidence in eventual successful framework deployment. Please clarify these points in the Experiment_Plan section to improve feasibility robustness and operational clarity."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty was rated as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the field is highly active, a strong way to boost impact and distinctiveness is to explicitly integrate relevant concepts from the linked globally-connected domains, such as technology acceptance models and human-in-the-loop systems in mental health care and suicide prevention contexts. For instance, adapting trust and ethics evaluation criteria tailored to critical applications like suicide prevention counseling could both deepen the framework's relevance and demonstrate measurable clinical impact. Furthermore, including metrics that assess the system's uptake and acceptance by mental health professionals in real-world scenarios would concretely link ethics and trustworthiness to technology adoption. Embedding these global concepts into the Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan sections can differentiate the framework by bridging evaluation with critical real-world human-centered outcomes, making the contribution more compelling for premier conference audiences."
