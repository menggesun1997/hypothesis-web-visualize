    "title": "Personalized Prompting-Retrieval Loops with Reinforcement Learning for Clinical Chatbots",
    "Problem_Statement": "Static prompting and retrieval methods do not adapt to individual patient interaction patterns, reducing clinical NLP system effectiveness and user trust.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gaps by creating a personalized prompting-retrieval architecture that dynamically adapts via RL based on patient response signals, inspired by human-computer interaction findings, enabling optimized dialogue paths and retrieval relevance per user.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Architect a closed-loop system where an RL agent optimizes prompts and retrieval queries based on user engagement metrics, clinical correctness feedback, and dialogue context. The system personalizes both prompt templates and knowledge retrieval in real-time to maximize clinical accuracy and user satisfaction.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect dialogue datasets with behavioral therapy sessions including user feedback. 2. Model RL environment with states as dialogue context, actions as prompt/retrieval strategy adjustments, rewards as clinical accuracy and engagement. 3. Compare personalized system to static baselines. 4. Evaluate via clinical accuracy, dialogue coherence, and user satisfaction scores.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Series of patient questions about insomnia with user indicated confusion on standard answers. Output: Adaptive prompt and retrieval responses tailored to patient's knowledge and emotional state improving clarity and treatment adherence.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If RL convergence is slow or unstable, apply offline RL or incorporate supervised fine-tuning from expert-curated dialogues."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method outlines a high-level closed-loop system using reinforcement learning (RL) to personalize prompts and retrieval dynamically. However, the core mechanism lacks clarity in several key areas: how exactly will user engagement metrics and clinical correctness feedback be quantified and integrated as reward signals? How will the system balance potentially competing objectives, such as maximizing clinical accuracy versus user satisfaction? Detailed specification of state and action spaces, as well as the strategy for incorporating multi-turn dialogue context into the RL agent's decision-making, is missing. Making these central components explicit will greatly improve the soundness and reproducibility of the method proposal, which currently reads as conceptually promising but underspecified for rigorous evaluation and replication. Please elaborate these technical details with precise definitions and methodological justifications to ensure the approach is both logically and practically coherent. This will strengthen confidence in the feasibility and validity of the RL-based optimization approach for clinical chatbot personalization proposed here, beyond a generic architectural sketch of closed-loop adaptation via RL agents. Targeted elaboration or preliminary examples of the underlying model components would be valuable additions to this section."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "While the step-by-step experiment plan is broadly sound, it currently under-specifies feasibility and scientific rigor aspects that are critical for successful validation. For instance, the plan lacks detail on how the behavioral therapy dialogue datasets will be obtained or constructed and if such datasets include rich, reliable user feedback signals necessary for RL reward modeling. It also does not explicate how clinical accuracy and user satisfaction will be objectively measured with validated metrics or gold standards, which is essential given the clinical setting. Moreover, the experiment plan does not address potential confounders like variability across patient populations or session lengths and gives no indication of sample size or statistical power considerations. Furthermore, fallback plans for RL training difficulties are mentioned but lack concrete experimental protocols, evaluation criteria, or benchmarks. To make this plan scientifically feasible and robust, more detailed experimental design and evaluation protocols should be incorporated, including data sourcing, metric definitions, baseline configuration, handling of ethical concerns, and clear criteria for success/failure. This added rigor will increase the likelihood of meaningful, reproducible results demonstrating the methodâ€™s stated benefits."
