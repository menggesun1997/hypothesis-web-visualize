    "title": "Science Journalism-Informed Transparency Layers for Biomedical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Biomedical AI ecosystems lack robust transparency and bias reporting mechanisms that draw on communication/media insights, resulting in insufficient public trust and ethical stewardship, especially in high-stakes clinical contexts.",
    "Motivation": "This project targets the external gap connecting 'artificial general intelligence' and 'AI ecosystem' to communication and media studies. The novelty is in fusing science journalism quality frameworks into AI model transparency architectures, enhancing public comprehension and trust while mitigating bias obfuscation in biomedical LLMs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design transparency layers inspired by best practices in science journalism, embedding narrative clarity, source credibility tagging, and uncertainty communication into LLM output explanations. Develop a bias reporting standard whose format and dissemination emulate high-quality science journalism techniques, including contextualizing findings with analogies, impact narratives, and expert quotes. Integrate these layers into biomedical AI interfaces enabling clinicians and patients to access layered explanations co-created with communication specialists.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Analyze exemplary science journalism pieces to extract narrative and transparency principles. 2) Build explanation templates for biomedical LLM outputs incorporating these principles. 3) Implement bias reporting protocols structured as digestible, multi-level reports (technical to layman). 4) Conduct user studies with medical professionals and patient groups to assess interpretability, trust, and perceived fairness. 5) Compare with standard explanation techniques using metrics such as comprehension scores, trust ratings, and bias detection accuracy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM-generated clinical recommendation for treatment with known subgroup efficacy disparities. Output: Accompanying transparency layer explaining recommendation rationale with lay-friendly narratives highlighting known biases, uncertainties, and expert opinions in accessible language improving user understanding and trust.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If specialized transparency layers are too complex for real-time system integration, fall back to generating post-hoc science journalism-style reports. Alternatively, employ automated summarization techniques constrained by audience expertise level to approximate this effect."

        "title": "Science Journalism-Informed Transparency Layers for Biomedical LLMs with Adaptive, Context-Aware Personalization",
        "Problem_Statement": "Biomedical AI ecosystems lack robust, interpretable transparency and bias reporting mechanisms that effectively bridge insights from communication and media studies with advanced AI techniques. This shortfall limits public trust and ethical stewardship, particularly in high-stakes clinical contexts where subgroup biases can impact treatment recommendations and patient outcomes.",
        "Motivation": "While prior efforts enhance transparency in biomedical LLMs, our approach uniquely integrates science journalism quality frameworks with adaptive AI technologies to create personalized, context-aware transparency layers. By combining narrative clarity and credible bias reporting with cutting-edge generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), our method enables dynamic tailoring of explanations to diverse user groups (clinicians, patients) and clinical complexities. This fusion uniquely addresses the NOV-COMPETITIVE landscape by advancing beyond static transparency into scalable, user-adaptive, and evidence-grounded communication, thereby substantially strengthening trust, comprehension, and ethical governance in biomedical AI.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose to design multi-layered transparency architectures inspired by best practices in science journalism, embedding narrative clarity, source credibility tagging, and uncertainty communication. These layers will be dynamically generated and tailored through GPT-based AI assistance models fine-tuned with RLHF to adapt explanation granularity, style, and content to individual user expertise and situational context (e.g., clinician vs. patient, clinical scenario complexity). We will integrate real-time information retrieval modules that enrich LLM outputs with up-to-date, validated scientific evidence, ensuring explanations are both trustworthy and contextually grounded. Bias reporting standards will be formatted as multi-level reports blending technical detail with lay analogies and expert quotes, co-created with communication specialists. This adaptive system will be integrated into biomedical AI interfaces to empower clinicians and patients with comprehensible, personalized transparency, enhancing fairness perception and informed decision-making.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Decompose exemplary science journalism into narrative and transparency principles; iteratively prototype explanation templates in collaboration with communication experts. 2) Develop GPT-based AI assistance models fine-tuned with RLHF to dynamically customize transparency layers per user profiles and complexity levels, integrating multi-modal communication styles. 3) Implement context-aware information retrieval pipelines to augment explanations with latest validated biomedical literature during output generation. 4) Construct bias reporting protocols hierarchically structured for multi-level comprehension, co-designed with domain experts and communication specialists. 5) Recruit diverse patient cohorts representing varied demographics alongside a stratified clinician sample across specialties and experience for user studies, ensuring inclusivity and representativeness. 6) Conduct iterative usability and interpretability evaluations with active feedback loops involving communication specialists to refine prototypes before wider deployment. 7) Evaluate transparency layers across varied clinical contexts (e.g., diagnostic recommendations, treatment options with known subgroup biases) using quantitative metrics (comprehension scores, trust ratings, bias detection accuracy) and qualitative analyses focused on fairness perception and impact on decision-making. 8) Comparative benchmarking against existing explanation methods to substantiate superiority and real-world applicability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An LLM-generated clinical treatment recommendation for a patient subgroup with documented efficacy disparities. Output: A dynamically tailored, multi-level transparency layer providing a lay-friendly narrative explaining the recommendation rationale, highlighting known biases and uncertainties contextualized with relevant up-to-date scientific findings retrieved in real-time. The explanation includes expert quotes and analogies suitable for patient understanding, with a more technical version accessible to clinicians. User feedback channels enable iterative refinement of explanation style and content, increasing trust and comprehension across stakeholder groups.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time adaptive transparency layers prove computationally intensive or technically challenging for integration, we will revert to generating post-hoc, science journalism-style reports customized by audience type using batch-processed GPT summarizations constrained by user expertise. Additionally, we will employ automated summarization and information retrieval techniques to simulate real-time contextual augmentation within resource limits, ensuring feasible deployment pathways while maintaining explanatory quality and accessibility."

Additionally, the plan should specify criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of transparency layers across varying clinical contexts and complexity levels. Incorporating iterative prototyping with active feedback loops from communication specialists could further ensure practical integration and usability before broader deployment. Clarifying these methodological details will enhance overall feasibility and scientific rigor of the evaluation phase, ensuring the approach can be realistically implemented and assessed in real-world biomedical AI environments, especially in high-stakes use cases like treatment recommendations involving subgroup biases. This will help pre-empt practical obstacles and provide stronger evidence for impact claims in clinical settings. Target these refinements in the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section for concreteness and robustness of validation methods and participant diversity strategies."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty screening labeled this work as NOV-COMPETITIVE — a new combination in a crowded space — a promising way to enhance impact and distinctiveness is to integrate cutting-edge generative techniques such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) with reinforcement learning from human feedback to dynamically tailor transparency layers at an individual user level (e.g., clinicians versus patients). Incorporating AI assistance modules that adaptively select or summarize explanations could improve scalability and personal relevance. Additionally, leveraging information retrieval to contextually augment model explanations with up-to-date scientific evidence dynamically linked during interaction can further boost trustworthiness and groundedness. Embedding these global AI advancements will help differentiate the work substantially by creating context-aware, user-customized transparency informed by real-time scientific content, amplifying both novelty and practical impact.
