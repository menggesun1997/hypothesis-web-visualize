    "title": "Adaptive Prompt Generation via Cognitive Load Modeling for Clinical Explanation Tasks",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs' prompt sensitivity and temperature hyperparameter variability cause inconsistent performance in generating clinical explanations, affecting reliability and user trust in decision support.",
    "Motivation": "Targets internal issue of prompt sensitivity and external opportunity to integrate computational psychology insights on cognitive load and human processing into prompt design, aiming at human-model alignment and robustness particularly in healthcare explanation contexts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive prompt generation system that dynamically adjusts prompt complexity based on modeled cognitive load metrics derived from prior user interaction data and task difficulty. Use reinforcement learning to optimize prompt templates, balancing informativeness, cognitive ease, and linguistic clarity. Implement evaluation mechanisms responsive to variations in human cognitive states and preferences.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect clinical explanation datasets annotated with user cognitive load indicators (e.g., response time, comprehension).\n2. Analyze effects of prompt style and temperature on explanation quality and user burden.\n3. Design cognitive load modeling algorithms to predict optimal prompt formulation.\n4. Train adaptive prompt generator using RL.\n5. Evaluate on automated medical explanation benchmarks and human user studies.\n6. Benchmark against static prompt strategies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Request for explanation of MRI findings related to brain tumor.\nExpected Output: A tailored explanation balancing medical detail with cognitive simplicity, adapting to user expertise and cognitive capacity, verified through user comprehension tests.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cognitive load estimation is unreliable, fall back to heuristic prompt templates stratified by user expertise levels. Alternatively, try feedback-driven online learning to refine prompts."
