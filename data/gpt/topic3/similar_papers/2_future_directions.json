        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel RAG framework incorporating a semantic alignment layer that maps retrieved documents and prompt contexts into a shared semantic embedding space inspired by Alzheimer's disease KGs. This alignment enables precise contextual fusion between retrieved data and generation input, reducing hallucinations. The approach involves constructing a behavior therapy-specific knowledge graph to guide retrieval, and incorporating dynamic semantic consistency checks during generation.",
