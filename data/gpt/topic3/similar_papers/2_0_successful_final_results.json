    "Problem_Statement": "Current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods in behavioral therapy encounter hallucination issues and lack robust domain-specific fidelity, limiting accuracy in critical patient queries.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap in hallucination and domain fidelity by integrating semantic alignment concepts from Alzheimer's knowledge graph frameworks, a hidden bridge from cognitive science knowledge graph architectures, thereby improving medical NLP reliability in behavioral therapy contexts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel RAG framework incorporating a semantic alignment layer that maps retrieved documents and prompt contexts into a shared semantic embedding space inspired by Alzheimer's disease KGs. This alignment enables precise contextual fusion between retrieved data and generation input, reducing hallucinations. The approach involves constructing a behavior therapy-specific knowledge graph to guide retrieval, and incorporating dynamic semantic consistency checks during generation.",

Construct a domain-specific knowledge graph from validated therapy guidelines and literature. 3. Implement semantic alignment module using graph embeddings. 4. Train and evaluate the RAG system versus standard RAG and vanilla LLM baselines. 5. Use metrics: domain-specific accuracy, hallucination rate, BLEU, and clinical relevance scores. 6. Conduct ablation studies on alignment component.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What are effective techniques for insomnia management in CBT-I?\" Expected Output: A medically accurate, contextually supported explanation citing therapy techniques aligned with knowledge graph evidence, without hallucinated claims.",

        "title": "Domain-Adapted Semantic Alignment Enhanced RAG for Intelligent Behavioral Therapy NLP with Patient Safety Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods for behavioral therapy NLP suffer from hallucinations and lack robust domain-specific semantic fidelity, which limits their reliability and clinical usability in sensitive patient interactions. While semantic alignment approaches demonstrated efficacy in Alzheimer's knowledge graph (KG) contexts, their direct application to behavioral therapy NLP is challenged by fundamental differences in domain knowledge structures, terminologies, and clinical workflows. This calls for a carefully adapted semantic alignment strategy explicitly tailored to behavioral therapy's unique ontology and clinical nuances, to ensure accurate information retrieval and generation that supports safe and evidence-based behavioral health advice.",
        "Motivation": "To overcome existing limitations in behavioral therapy NLP, we aim to develop a novel RAG framework that advances domain fidelity and hallucination reduction through a semantic alignment paradigm adapted specifically for behavioral therapy knowledge structures and clinical contexts. Unlike direct transplant of Alzheimer's KG methods, we ground our approach in psychological theories and therapy-specific ontologies, enabling nuanced semantic embedding that respects behavioral domain complexity. Furthermore, to elevate clinical impact and novelty beyond competitive baselines, we propose integrating this framework within an intelligent clinical decision support system that incorporates real-time patient safety validation and personalization via electronic health record (EHR) contextualization. This synthesis of semantic alignment, patient safety informed retrieval, and personalized contextualization represents a substantial innovation poised to transform behavioral therapy NLP with real-world clinical utility and translational readiness.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-component RAG framework entailing: (1) Construction of a comprehensive behavioral therapy-specific knowledge graph, aligned dynamically with clinical guidelines, psychological theories, and therapy ontologies to capture domain semantics more faithfully than prior Alzheimer-centric models. (2) Adaptation of semantic alignment methods through graph embeddings and contrastive learning tailored to behavioral therapy terminology and hierarchical knowledge patterns, thereby optimizing retrieval context fusion to minimize hallucinations. (3) Integration of patient safety rules derived from therapy protocols as real-time semantic consistency and risk mitigation checks within generation pipelines to automatically flag or refine potentially unsafe outputs. (4) Incorporation of electronic health record (EHR) data for patient-specific contextualization, enabling personalized therapy information retrieval and response generation. (5) Embedding this system architecture within an intelligent decision-making support framework designed for clinical deployment, featuring dynamic feedback loops informed by process mining of therapy sessions to iteratively improve model safety and accuracy. Collectively, these innovations extend RAG from static QA to a context-aware, safety-conscious behavioral therapy assistant aligned with advanced information systems engineering principles.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Gather and preprocess behavioral therapy clinical datasets including CBT-I transcripts, therapy guidelines, and anonymized EHRs for patient contextual features. 2. Construct and iteratively refine a behavioral therapy knowledge graph incorporating psychological theories and clinician-validated ontologies. 3. Develop and validate semantic alignment embedding modules using contrastive learning, specifically tuned to the therapy domain's knowledge characteristics. 4. Engineer and integrate patient safety validation layers that apply domain safety constraints during generation, informed by guidelines and session process mining. 5. Implement retrieval-augmented generation models incorporating domain-adapted semantic alignment, patient safety filters, and patient-specific EHR contextualization. 6. Conduct comprehensive evaluation against baselines (standard RAG, vanilla LLMs) using metrics including domain-specific accuracy, hallucination rate, clinical relevance, BLEU, and safety violation incidence. 7. Perform ablation studies isolating semantic alignment, safety validation, and personalization effects. 8. Prototype a clinical decision support interface and conduct expert usability assessment for translational readiness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Given a patient with chronic insomnia and mild anxiety recorded in their EHR, what CBT-I techniques are recommended to improve sleep hygiene safely?\" Expected Output: A clinically accurate, personalized explanation incorporating validated CBT-I techniques referenced in the behavioral therapy knowledge graph, contextualized to the patientâ€™s anxiety condition, and adhering to patient safety rules (e.g., avoiding contraindicated advice), with citations to guidelines and no hallucinated content.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If domain adaptation of semantic alignment yields limited improvement, explore alternative embedding strategies such as graph neural networks with domain-specific pretraining or generative adversarial networks for semantic consistency. Should patient safety integration pose implementation challenges, we will incrementally introduce human-in-the-loop review mechanisms and active learning to refine safety validation iteratively. If EHR contextualization proves sensitive or technically constrained, layered anonymized synthetic data generation will support personalization experiments while safeguarding privacy, ensuring robustness of personalization approaches before real-world deployment."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that semantic alignment methods from Alzheimer's knowledge graphs directly translate to behavioral therapy NLP requires stronger justification. Alzheimer's disease knowledge graphs and behavioral therapy domains differ in terminology, knowledge structure complexity, and clinical context. Clarify how underlying semantic models and graph embeddings effectively generalize across these distinct biomedical subdomains to ensure relevance and efficacy, or consider adapting the alignment method specifically to behavioral therapy characteristics rather than direct transplant from Alzheimer's KG techniques. This will strengthen confidence in foundational assumptions driving the approach's novelty and success potential within the target domain, mitigating risk of domain mismatch or oversimplification of semantic capture in clinical NLP generation tasks prone to hallucinations. Provide references or preliminary validation if available to substantiate this cross-domain semantic transfer assumption thoroughly in your motivation and proposed method sections. This aspect is critical before deep system development to avoid foundational soundness pitfalls that may impact downstream feasibility and impact claims for the therapy-specific RAG system proposed.
