    "title": "Cross-Domain Semantic Knowledge Transfer for Zero-Shot Robustness in Sensitive Domains",
    "Problem_Statement": "Zero-shot LLMs struggle with robustness and hallucinations on domain-sensitive tasks lacking labeled data, limiting their practical utility in biomedical, regulatory, or operational scenarios.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gaps (d) hallucination and accuracy issues by innovatively transferring semantic knowledge from structured clinical decision support systems and power dispatch ontologies into the zero-shot inference pipeline, enhancing reliability with minimal tuning.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a semantic knowledge embedding module derived from curated domain ontologies and CDSS rules that interfaces with the LLM during zero-shot inference. This module constrains generation via contextual priors and logical consistency checks to reduce hallucinations and improve task accuracy without domain-specific fine-tuning.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate ontologies and decision rules from healthcare and power dispatch standards. 2. Develop knowledge embedding and logical constraint layer. 3. Integrate with a base LLM zero-shot inference engine. 4. Compare with baseline zero-shot LLMs and fine-tuned variants. 5. Metrics: hallucination rate, domain task accuracy, logical consistency scores, user trust ratings.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Regulatory text summarization in finance domain with no labeled data. Expected Output: Summary adhering strictly to regulatory rules with no fabricated details. Input: Biomedical question answering. Output: Accurate answers consistent with clinical guidelines.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If integration with knowledge embeddings reduces model fluency, explore hybrid pipeline architectures with a post-processing logical consistency verifier. Alternatively, collect small labeled datasets and partially fine-tune guided by semantic constraints."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method needs clearer elaboration on how the semantic knowledge embedding module will effectively interface with the large language model at zero-shot inference time. Specifically, the integration mechanism by which ontology-derived constraints and CDSS rules modulate or constrain LLM output is insufficiently described. Clarify whether this involves architectural modification, input prompting strategies, or intermediate representation fusion, and provide more reasoning on how logical consistency checks are operationalized without fine-tuning. This clarity is critical to assess soundness and reproducibility of the method, especially given the complexity of constraining generative LLMs in real time without domain-specific tuning or latency bottlenecks. Consider adding a formal schematic or pseudocode to improve rigor and transparency in the methodology section of the proposal, ensuring the approach is well-justified and technically feasible at scale in sensitive domains with strict accuracy needs and zero-shot constraints. This foundational mechanistic clarity will strengthen confidence in both the theoretical and practical viability of the approach across biomedical and regulatory contexts described in the Problem_Statement and Test Cases sections.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan requires improvements in experimental rigour and feasibility assessment. While the high-level steps are broadly sensible, the plan lacks detail on how domain ontologies and decision rules will be quantitatively evaluated for quality and coverage prior to embedding. It is also unclear what baseline LLMs will be used, how zero-shot conditions are strictly defined, and what specific datasets or benchmarks will be applied to measure hallucination rates and logical consistency scores in domain-sensitive scenarios like biomedical and regulatory text. Recommend specifying exact data sources, evaluation metrics (with operational definitions and thresholds), and methods of user trust assessment (including participant selection and criteria) to ensure scientific reproducibility and robustness. Additionally, clarify contingency thresholds that determine when fallback plans activate, including minimal labeled data requirements and fine-tuning protocols. This detailed experiment planning is essential to convincingly demonstrate feasibility and expected gains over strong baselines given the competitive nature of this research area and the critical safety concerns in the target domains.\n\n"
