    "title": "Multimodal Human-in-the-Loop Bias Auditing for Clinical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs adapted to biomedical domains exhibit persistent biases that adversely affect decision-making across diverse patient subgroups, particularly in clinical settings. Existing bias auditing tools lack integration of domain expert feedback during the model lifecycle, limiting effective bias identification and mitigation.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the internal gap of insufficient human-in-the-loop mechanisms and the external gap of embedding health professionals' perspectives within AI pipelines, as identified in the Research Landscape. By integrating direct stakeholder engagement from clinicians in a structured, multimodal bias auditing framework, it innovates beyond current static bias evaluation methods.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a human-in-the-loop multimodal bias auditing system combining clinical textual notes, medical images, and LLM outputs. The system engages health professionals via interactive dashboards that highlight potential bias signals detected from model outputs and input data distributions. Clinicians provide real-time annotations on bias relevance and severity, which are encoded and fed back to adjust model fine-tuning dynamically through continual learning protocols. The framework also incorporates patient subgroup metadata for granular bias tracking and iterative interpretability modules to explain model rationale.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect diverse biomedical datasets with patient subgroup annotations including clinical notes and associated images (e.g., MIMIC-IV, CheXpert). 2) Fine-tune a foundation LLM on biomedical data. 3) Implement the bias signal detection engine based on statistical disparities and representational analyses. 4) Build a clinician-facing interface for bias feedback. 5) Conduct iterative human-in-the-loop fine-tuning cycles leveraging clinician annotations. 6) Evaluate bias reduction using fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity difference, equalized odds) on held-out subgroups, alongside clinical relevance assessed through expert surveys.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical text describing a chest X-ray report referencing symptoms in an elderly female patient subgroup. Model output initially underestimates pneumothorax risk for elderly women. After clinician bias annotation via the system highlighting subgroup underprediction, the model updates its risk estimation. Output: Adjusted risk prediction reflecting appropriate pneumothorax risk for elderly female patients, increasing fairness and clinical trustworthiness.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time clinician feedback proves logistically challenging, simulate human-in-the-loop annotations using synthetic expert knowledge bases and retrospective bias labels. Alternatively, enhance model interpretability modules to allow automated bias explanations facilitating self-correction without immediate human input."

        "title": "Multimodal Human-in-the-Loop Bias Auditing for Clinical LLMs with Global Health Integration and Clinician Engagement Protocols",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language models (LLMs) adapted for biomedical domains continue to exhibit persistent biases adversely impacting clinical decision-making across diverse patient subgroups, especially in underrepresented populations. Existing bias auditing tools often lack robust human-in-the-loop mechanisms that actively integrate domain expert feedback during the model lifecycle, and rarely consider global health disparities such as nutritional and socioeconomic factors influencing population health heterogeneity. This gap limits effective, equitable bias detection and mitigation in clinical AI systems deployed in varied settings worldwide.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing persistent biases in clinical LLMs requires advancing beyond static evaluation methods by incorporating dynamic, expert-driven bias identification and mitigation frameworks that are grounded in both local clinical realities and global health disparities. This research builds upon internal gaps in human-in-the-loop feedback integration by embedding comprehensive clinician engagement protocols addressing operational feasibility, and externally by leveraging partnerships with global health organizations like the International Union of Nutritional Sciences. By aligning bias auditing with global nutritional and socioeconomic disparities, this approach aims to significantly elevate fairness, generalizability, and translational impact of clinical AI across diverse international populations. This dual focus uniquely positions our framework to outpace current competitive baselines, enhancing clinical trustworthiness and policy relevance in heterogeneous health ecosystems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel multimodal human-in-the-loop bias auditing system for clinical LLMs integrating textual clinical notes, medical imaging, and patient metadata enriched with globally informed health determinants such as nutritional status and socioeconomic indicators. A core innovation is embedding a rigorous clinician engagement methodology encompassing clinician recruitment strategies, scheduling protocols sensitive to workload constraints, initial usability testing of interactive bias annotation dashboards, and iterative pilot studies to calibrate bias annotation standards and improve annotation efficiency. The system will also incorporate active learning techniques to prioritize samples for clinician review, minimizing clinician burden while maximizing informative feedback. Importantly, our framework integrates datasets and guidelines from the International Union of Nutritional Sciences, enabling auditing and interpretation modules to detect and validate biases relative to global nutritional and demographic disparities. Clinicians contribute real-time annotations highlighting bias relevance and severity, which feed into a continual learning fine-tuning loop dynamically adjusting model parameters. Iterative interpretability modules provide transparent explanations contextualized by international health standards to facilitate cross-national applicability and policy alignment. This tightly coupled human-in-the-loop and global health integration advances novelty by collectively addressing clinical operationalization challenges and extending auditing breadth to vital global health equity dimensions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble diverse biomedical datasets (e.g., MIMIC-IV, CheXpert) enriched with patient subgroup metadata incorporating nutritional and socioeconomic variables aligned with International Union of Nutritional Sciences frameworks. 2) Establish clinician partnerships across specialties and institutions, develop structured recruitment pipelines, and conduct workload-sensitive scheduling to ensure sustained engagement. 3) Design and conduct iterative usability testing of the clinician annotation dashboard, including pilot annotation sessions to refine interface design and calibrate shared bias definitions and severity scales. 4) Implement active learning-based sample prioritization to streamline annotation workload. 5) Fine-tune foundation LLMs on biomedical data and integrate continual learning protocols incorporating clinician feedback. 6) Embed global health-guided bias detection modules leveraging international nutritional standards for cross-validation. 7) Conduct full-scale iterative human-in-the-loop fine-tuning cycles with continuous monitoring of clinician feedback quality and engagement. 8) Evaluate bias reduction rigorously via statistical fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity difference, equalized odds) on clinically relevant subgroups, complemented by expert surveys assessing clinical trustworthiness and interpretability informed by global health disparity annotations. 9) Document operational feasibility findings regarding clinician recruitment, engagement, and annotation workload to guide future deployments.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A clinical text report from an elderly female patient subgroup with chest X-ray images and socioeconomic metadata indicating low nutritional status as defined by international guidelines. Initial model output underestimates pneumothorax risk in this subgroup. Through the annotation dashboard, clinicians flag this underprediction bias, particularly emphasizing global nutritional factors not previously considered. The active learning system escalates similar cases for review, and the continual learning process incorporates this feedback updating the model. Output: Revised risk prediction that appropriately accounts for pneumothorax risk in elderly female patients with nutritional vulnerabilities, reflecting improved fairness and alignment with both clinical and global health standards, thereby enhancing clinical trust and applicability across diverse patient populations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time clinician engagement presents unforeseen logistical limitations, we will pivot to an enhanced simulation strategy combining synthetic expert annotations grounded in validated knowledge bases enriched by international nutritional and socioeconomic standards. Additionally, we will intensify automated bias interpretability modules that incorporate global health data proxies enabling model self-correction suggestions without immediate human input. Pilot studies will inform the balance between simulated and live expert feedback to maintain rigor while adapting to practical constraints encountered during deployment."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan, while thorough in detailing data collection, model fine-tuning, bias detection, and iterative clinician feedback, lacks discussion about practical challenges in recruiting, engaging, and retaining domain experts (clinicians) for real-time interactive bias annotation. Real-time human-in-the-loop feedback in clinical settings may face logistical and calibration issues, including alignment on bias definitions and time constraints on busy professionals. To increase feasibility, the experimental plan should explicitly incorporate strategies for clinician recruitment, scheduling, annotation interface usability testing, and contingency protocols beyond the fallback plan, such as active learning to minimize clinician burden or pilot studies validating the annotation process prior to full-scale iteration cycles. Clarifying these operational details will strengthen confidence in executing the plan realistically and under resource constraints without compromising rigor or clinician goodwill, which is crucial for success in human-centered clinical AI research. Targeting this will ensure the method’s real-world applicability and scalability in clinical environments, beyond purely technical feasibility demonstrated through datasets and model metrics alone. This critique targets the 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' section for enhancing scientific soundness and practical feasibility of the human-in-the-loop paradigm implementation in clinical settings.  \n\n---\n\n[SUGGESTION: Incorporate explicit clinician engagement methodology, usability studies, and stepwise pilot evaluations into the experiment plan to address operational feasibility gaps on human-in-the-loop feedback implementation.]"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the conceived multimodal human-in-the-loop bias auditing system tailored for clinical LLMs, a strong avenue to amplify both impact and novelty is the integration of global health perspectives, especially from large-scale international bodies like the International Union of Nutritional Sciences. Their guidelines and data on nutritional disparities affecting diverse populations could serve as a valuable external validation layer for detected biases or a source to extend the bias auditing framework to cross-national demographic and health variance. This can catalyze generalization of the approach beyond individual hospital systems and offer a benchmark for equitable AI-driven clinical decision support under varied nutritional, socioeconomic, and ethnic contexts worldwide. Embedding such globally-linked biomedical knowledge and stakeholder standards into the human-in-the-loop feedback loops or interpretability modules enriches the auditing rigor and translational value, positioning the research in a more competitive niche with tangible, far-reaching clinical policy implications. This suggestion directly relates to broadening the framework’s scope and grounding it in globally relevant health disparities, addressing dynamic clinical needs collaboratively with international scientific communities, which is highly valued in premier conferences and critical funding bodies.  \n\n---\n\n[SUGGESTION: Collaborate with or incorporate frameworks from internationally recognized bodies such as the International Union of Nutritional Sciences to enhance bias auditing robustness, domain relevance, and demonstrate wider impact beyond local clinical settings.]"
