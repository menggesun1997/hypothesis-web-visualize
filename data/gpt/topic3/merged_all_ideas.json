        "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) exhibit sensitivity to minimal prompt design variations, leading to inconsistent and unreliable measurements of bias and hallucination tendencies across tasks and contexts.",
        "Motivation": "While prior research has explored prompt perturbations for bias detection, there remains a critical gap in building a systematic, interpretable, and reproducible framework that can algorithmically generate controlled prompt variants embedding diverse bias contexts and reliably aggregate output variability for comprehensive bias and hallucination quantification. Addressing this gap is crucial especially given the competitive nature of novelty in prompt-centric evaluations, demanding a principled integration of meta-evaluation and user-centric tools to enhance diagnostic precision, reproducibility, and practical utility across LLMs of varying scales.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an end-to-end Dynamic Prompt Engineering framework featuring three core components: (1) a hybrid prompt perturbation generator utilizing both rule-based linguistic templates and learned transformation models fine-tuned on bias-laden corpora to produce systematic, parameterized bias-contextual prompt variants—embedding political, personality, and social biases explicitly encoded via interpretable control tokens; (2) a meta-evaluation module that employs statistical measures such as Jensen-Shannon divergence and calibration error on LLM outputs to quantify robustness, bias strength, and hallucination rates by comparing probabilistic outputs across prompt variants, while hallucination detection leverages known factuality benchmarks combined with calibrated confidence thresholds; and (3) an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) inspired by intelligent decision-making systems that allows researchers to visualize variance patterns, configure perturbation scopes, and iteratively refine prompt generation driven by quantitative diagnostic scores. This modular design facilitates reproducibility through open algorithmic specifications and APIs compatible with varied LLM platforms, ranging from moderate (e.g., GPT-3 Ada) to large-scale models (e.g., GPT-4), enabling consistent bias and hallucination evaluation with improved task completion rates and interpretability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select diverse LLMs: GPT-3 Ada, GPT-3 Davinci, GPT-4 via OpenAI API, and open-source LLaMA 2 (7B and 13B) using Hugging Face pipelines to ensure broad architecture coverage. 2) Construct bias-contextual prompt transformation rules including substitution, negation, and style shift templates, augmented by a learned paraphrase generator trained on identified biased/unbiased sentence pairs to create controlled perturbations embedding political and personality bias tokens. 3) Define metrics: output variance assessed by semantic embedding cosine distances and Jensen-Shannon divergence on token distributions; bias shifts quantified using preset lexicon-based sentiment scores and political leaning classifiers; hallucination rates measured via factuality comparison on established knowledge benchmarks (e.g., FEVER) and cross-checked with confidence calibration errors. 4) Deploy human annotation studies with 30 expert annotators specialized in sociolinguistics and ethics, labeling a stratified 1000-output sample subset for bias presence and hallucination validity, using inter-annotator agreement (Cohen’s kappa > 0.75) to ensure consistency. 5) Integrate observational data into meta-evaluation module via a weighted aggregation algorithm prioritizing stable diagnostic signals iteratively enhancing prompt perturbation parameters via Bayesian optimization until convergence in bias variance reduction or hallucination detection improvement, defined as a >10% increase in detection accuracy from baseline. 6) Conduct pilot studies to calibrate perturbation intensity thresholds to balance diagnostic noise and signal across tasks including multi-class classification and commonsense reasoning. 7) Utilize the GUI for visualizing experiment progress, enabling hypothesis-driven prompt refinements and downstream evaluation of improved task completion rates. 8) Document failures and refine fallback protocols, including backoff to minimal perturbation templates when noise overwhelms signal per quantitative criteria.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "A politically charged prompt about climate policy is transformed into variants embedding left-leaning, right-leaning, and neutral bias tokens via the hybrid perturbation system, with the LLM outputs analyzed for sentiment polarity shifts measured against baseline responses. Another example involves injecting personality style shifts (e.g., authoritative vs. empathetic tone) into customer service queries, assessing hallucination continuity across response variants using FEVER factual benchmarks. The GUI enables visualization of output distributions, highlighting variance spikes correlating with bias injection points and providing interactive filtering by prompt type and model scale.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic prompt perturbations generate excessive noise compromising interpretability, implement a controlled reduction of perturbation scope by constraining parameter space via reinforcement learning with reward signals tied to diagnostic signal-to-noise ratio metrics obtained in pilot phases. If hallucination detection accuracy remains insufficient, incorporate complementary approaches such as external knowledge retrievers or ensemble factuality verifiers. Additionally, introduce thresholds for prompt variant acceptance based on calibrated variance limits triggering automated fallback to conservative prompt sets. Throughout, user feedback collected via the GUI will guide manual overrides and prompt refinement cycles, ensuring practical robustness and adherence to evaluation objectives."

Unlike prior hybrid human-LLM pipelines, we introduce a structured feedback-driven loop that leverages advanced bias detection classifiers alongside a novel semantic interoperability framework for cross-cultural and political nuance awareness. By incorporating automatic evaluation protocols inspired by question-answering and document retrieval metrics, our approach offers superior scalability, cost-efficiency, and bias control, setting a new standard for dataset curation in politically charged NLP domains.",

This pipeline emphasizes semantic interoperability and cultural awareness to improve annotation fairness across diverse political contexts.",

Dataset Selection: Choose 3 politically sensitive NLP datasets (e.g., hate speech, opinion mining, political stance detection), each containing at least 10,000 unlabeled samples including sensitive content from multiple cultural and political contexts.\n2. Preliminary Feasibility Study: Perform zero-shot annotation on a representative subset (e.g., 2,000 samples) using GPT-4; conduct detailed error analysis stratifying types of annotation faults and bias patterns.\n3. Bias Classifier Development: Train semi-supervised political bias detection models using existing limited labeled data (around 1,000 samples) augmented with cultural awareness embeddings; validate classifier performance using cross-validation and external benchmarks.\n4. Hybrid Annotation Pipeline Execution:\n   a. Apply zero-shot LLM annotation on full dataset.\n   b.

        "Fallback_Plan": "If LLM zero-shot annotations exhibit an overall accuracy below 70% or bias classifier false negatives exceed 15% after two prompt calibration iterations, we fallback to a semi-supervised active learning strategy. This strategy involves iterative human annotation prioritized exclusively on samples either flagged as biased or with ambiguous LLM confidence scores, thereby minimizing annotation expenses. Crowd annotators will be guided by detailed annotation guidelines enhanced with culturally-aware instructions to improve label consistency.

By bridging principles from cognitive neuroscience and state-of-the-art RL techniques for generative AI, this approach offers a superior, fine-grained reliability metric reflecting dynamic reasoning capabilities beyond static accuracy scores. The integration of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for perturbation generation and variational autoencoders (VAEs) for latent cognitive state inference further enhances robustness and interpretability, representing a novel synthesis advancing AI capabilities evaluation.",

These signals—operationalizing fatigue and bias—are inferred via latent variable models (e.g., VAEs) trained on proxy cognitive data (e.g., error patterns, response times), and directly influence the reward shaping mechanism to penalize or reward reasoning paths reflecting cognitive states. Additionally, adversarial input perturbations are generated via GAN-based modules to systematically stress-test reasoning stability. This framework leverages actor-critic RL algorithms to optimize performance metrics incorporating (1) final answer accuracy, (2) intermediate reasoning trace coherence, and (3) cognitive state consistency scores. The method uniquely formalizes fatigue and bias as continuous latent variables integrated into reward shaping, enabling precise, mechanistic interpretation and benchmarking of LLM reasoning under neurocognitive constraints—advancing beyond prior work lacking such integrated, biologically-inspired RL reward architectures.",

Current models are optimized primarily for task accuracy and context-dependent generation, often yielding fluctuating or superficial personality expressions influenced by prompt phrasing, task demands, or randomness. Without rigorous disambiguation between genuine personality trait signals and confounding stylistic or contextual variations, existing embedding probes risk misinterpretation and undermine the validity of benchmarking efforts aimed at social cognition metrics.

This enhanced approach promotes scientific rigor and interpretability, positioning the work as a pioneering effort in embedding-based personality assessment for LLMs. Moreover, expanding probe applicability to dynamic natural language query systems and personalized dialogue agents offers transformative potential for adaptive AI-human interaction, elevating both research relevance and practical impact in a competitive NLP landscape.",

We will develop training-based adaptation modules that calibrate probes across diverse LLM architectures and fine-tuning regimes to enhance generalizability and robustness. Embedding probes will be validated against human personality assessment datasets and linked to multi-dimensional linguistic feature sets, enabling interpretable, multidimensional trait extraction.

These are encoded as structured features.\n\n2. **Ontological Explanation Conditioning:** Dedicated domain ontologies encapsulating explanation preferences, narrative styles, and user profile requirements (clinicians, lawyers) guide explanation style and content. Ontologies interface via knowledge graphs accessible to the generation module.\n\n3. **Transformer-based Explanation Generator with Fusion Layers:** A transformer LLM augmented with specialized fusion layers integrates discourse features, ontological knowledge embeddings, and real-time user interaction signals (e.g., eye gaze fixation and saccades) captured via multi-sensor fusion frameworks. Fusion layers modulate attention and explanation content dynamically.\n\n4. **User Interaction Feedback Loop:** Eye-tracking and interaction metrics feed back to the explanation generator to iteratively refine explanation granularity and saliency, forming an intelligent tutoring system tailored to the user's cognitive load and attentional state.\n\n5. **Processing Pipeline and Data Flow:** Inputs first undergo discourse parsing and ontology mapping; the resulting feature set and user interaction data are fused into the LLM's internal representations during explanation generation.

        "Problem_Statement": "Current factual consistency assessment methods in domain-specific NLP either rely solely on Natural Language Inference (NLI) or on probabilistic noisy channel models, missing out on their complementary strengths. Moreover, existing hybrid approaches lack explicit mechanisms to fuse semantic entailment signals with error likelihood estimations, reducing interpretability and robustness—especially when detecting nuanced hallucinations across diverse biomedical and clinical texts. Additionally, synthetic data generation to train such models often inadequately simulates realistic hallucination patterns, limiting model generalization and robustness under domain shift.",
        "Motivation": "Although prior works propose combining NLI and noisy channel modeling for factuality evaluation, they often overlook the need for an explicit, interpretable fusion mechanism and rigorous synthetic data grounded on expert-validated error taxonomies, which are critical for tackling the brittleness of existing models in highly specialized domains. Addressing this internal gap with a principled fusion approach and the external gap related to realistic error synthesis and robust evaluation distinguishes our proposal. By integrating insights from human-computer interaction on gating mechanisms and software engineering best practices for modular design, our hybrid model aims to surpass baseline approaches, ensuring practical applicability and superior domain-adaptive factual consistency assessment.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an explicit fusion framework where NLI entailment scores and noisy channel probabilities interact via a learnable gating mechanism modeled as a sigmoid-activated neural network component. Formally, given input claim c and generated summary s, the noisy channel model computes P(s|c,e) conditioned on error hypotheses e (e.g., paraphrase, omission, hallucination) derived from a domain-specific error taxonomy. Concurrently, an NLI model provides entailment score E(c,s). We define the fused factual consistency score F(c,s) as:\n\nF(c,s) = G(E(c,s)) * P(s|c,e) + (1 - G(E(c,s))) * (P(s|c,e))\n\nwhere G() is the learned gating function modulating the contribution of each component, ensuring interpretable, adaptive integration. The noisy channel's error hypotheses are informed by structured ontologies specific to biomedical and clinical domains. \n\nTraining proceeds end-to-end on synthesized data generated from carefully curated domain corpora, where synthetic noisy outputs are produced using error simulation functions parametrized from an expert-validated hallucination taxonomy, balancing frequency across error modes to avoid bias. Supervision uses a combination of known error mode labels and factual consistency annotations, enabling multi-task learning to stabilize training. This modular design facilitates human-computer interaction for model interpretability and debugging via software engineering best practices.",

This score discriminates subtle hallucination cases such as omission (missing patient context) or factual distortion (wrong medication), which standalone models may misclassify.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If end-to-end training proves unstable, we will employ a staged training approach: separately train NLI and noisy channel models, then learn the gating function post hoc using calibration datasets. We will also explore simpler fusion methods such as weighted linear interpolation with weights learned via domain-adaptive regression.

(3) Adaptive Augmentation Selector — An explicit algorithmic policy (detailed in pseudo-code below) dynamically triggered by domain shift signals governs selection among a predefined augmentation library tailored to domain characteristics (e.g., synonym replacement weighted by knowledge graph semantic distances, contextual embedding perturbations constrained by domain ontologies). The selector integrates IoT context signals encoded as attribute vectors (e.g., device type, location) that modulate augmentation probability distributions while preserving privacy through attribute-based access control. (4) Human-in-the-Loop Refinement — Domain experts intermittently provide targeted feedback on augmentation quality at federated nodes through privacy-compliant interfaces, while fallback reinforcement learning-based reward models simulate feedback during sparse expert availability, ensuring continuous augmentation policy optimization.

        "title": "Cross-Domain Ethical Metric Transfer from Biomedical to Legal NLP Benchmarking with Explainable AI and Human-in-the-Loop Validation",
        "Problem_Statement": "While biomedical NLP ethical metrics have matured focusing on patient privacy and safety, direct application to legal NLP neglects critical domain-specific ethical nuances such as legal confidentiality, interpretive risks, and compliance with normative legal standards. The biomedical and legal domains differ substantially in data types, ethical priorities, and regulatory frameworks, undermining naive transferability. Therefore, a grounded theoretical and empirical framework is essential to rigorously identify overlapping and divergent ethical principles, enabling principled adaptation of biomedical ethical evaluation metrics to legal NLP. This approach must incorporate explainability and human-centered validation to ensure meaningful ethical assessment rather than simplistic reweighting.",
        "Motivation": "Existing ethical evaluation benchmarks primarily target biomedical NLP, with limited exploration of their adaptability to legal NLP, where ethical risks are equally impactful but differently manifested. This gap limits the development of standardized cross-domain ethical metrics and hinders consistent evaluations across domains. Our work advances novelty by proposing a knowledge-graph-enhanced framework integrating domain-specific ethical ontologies from both biomedical and legal fields, combined with explainable AI techniques and few-shot learning to adapt pretrained language models ethically. Leveraging human-in-the-loop protocols and rigorous empirical validation, we aim to pioneer a robust, interpretable, and transferable ethical metric framework that navigates complex normative divergences while fostering alignment with socially critical legal NLP tasks such as contract summarization and compliance checking.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We will first construct a comprehensive bilingual ethical knowledge graph synthesizing ethical principles, constraints, and normative criteria from biomedical and legal literature and standards, supported by scholarly grounding and expert input. Using this graph, we will map overlaps and divergences via ontology alignment and thematic clustering to clarify transferability boundaries. We will design an explainable AI evaluation framework that integrates these semantic insights with pretrained, retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs), enhanced by few-shot learning (FSL) approaches to induce domain-specific ethical reasoning without exhaustive re-training. Ethical metrics will be instantiated as composite scores incorporating confidentiality preservation, interpretive fidelity, and normative compliance, validated through a human-in-the-loop multi-stage evaluation involving domain experts and manual annotation protocols. Multi-task learning will be operationalized by joint training on curated biomedical and legal NLP datasets, leveraging augmented ethical labels derived from the knowledge graph and pilot feedback to tune metric weights. This comprehensive approach explicitly clarifies and justifies metric transferability, ensures explainability, and systematically evaluates ethical compliance in challenging real-world legal NLP scenarios.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Literature survey and formal construction of biomedical and legal ethical ontologies; 2) Development and alignment of a cross-domain ethical knowledge graph incorporating domain experts from biomedical ethics, legal ethics, and NLP; 3) Dataset curation involving public biomedical NLP benchmarks and new legal NLP datasets (e.g., contract summarization, compliance check corpora) annotated via expert consensus guidelines for ethical attributes; 4) Implementation of retrieval-augmented pretrained LLMs fine-tuned with few-shot learning to capture domain-specific ethical nuances guided by the knowledge graph; 5) Quantitative evaluation using task accuracy metrics (e.g., macro F1-score) alongside newly developed explainable ethical compliance scores; 6) Qualitative human-in-the-loop validation with domain experts conducting manual evaluations assessing confidentiality, interpretive correctness, and compliance risks; 7) Iterative refinement of metrics and model training informed by pilot results, ablation studies, and error analysis; 8) Comparative benchmarking against domain-specific ethical rule-based baselines and non-adapted biomedical metrics to demonstrate empirical effectiveness and transferability benefits.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Evaluate and summarize legal risks in the new contract clause while ensuring confidentiality and interpretive accuracy.\" Expected Output: Text summary omitting sensitive client information, presenting risks without misleading or oversimplifying interpretations, with an ethical compliance score supported by explanation components highlighting detected privacy preservation and risk assessment fidelity. Additional test cases involve assessing compliance in identifying misleading contract statements and preserving privileged communication references ethically.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If transfer via knowledge graph and few-shot methods shows limited practicality, fallback includes development of lightweight modular ethical metrics combining core universal ethical principles (e.g., confidentiality, harm avoidance) with domain-specific rule sets encoded explicitly for legal NLP tasks. We will also explore expanding human-in-the-loop feedback cycles to refine these metrics iteratively. Alternatively, focusing on holistic explanation-driven evaluation frameworks for legal NLP without direct metric transfer, utilizing explainability as the central ethical evaluation scaffold, will be pursued to maintain impact while mitigating transfer assumptions risk."

Ethical evaluation confirms compliance with patient privacy regulations by excluding sensitive data from retrieval. Conflict resolution prioritized ethics to remove unverified sources.\"",

Conflict resolution strategies prioritize factual accuracy with adjustable weighting allowing stakeholders to calibrate α and β for context-sensitive trade-offs.\n\n2) **Ethical Annotation Schema & Scoring:** Develop a fine-grained annotation schema incorporating ethical subdimensions such as misinformation avoidance, bias mitigation, privacy preservation, and harmful content detection. Ethical scores use weighted heuristics and neural classifiers trained on curated biomedical ethical challenge datasets, producing continuous compliance values.\n\n3) **Multimodal Data Integration:** Extend retrieval mechanisms to incorporate both text and visual medical data (e.g., radiology images, charts) leveraging vision-language models. Retrieval-augmented LLMs are fine-tuned to jointly reason over heterogeneous inputs with the composite metric guiding training.\n\n4) **Applied Tasks & Evaluation:** Apply framework to large-scale, complex medical QA datasets with multimodal inputs and intelligent decision-making workflows.

However, joint optimization attempts suffer from unclear justifications regarding their superiority over sequential or separate methods, and lack rigorous grounding in clinical fidelity assessment. Moreover, capturing nuanced clinical knowledge and minimizing hallucinations remain significant challenges, as existing reward signals for reinforcement learning often fail to incorporate domain-expert insights comprehensively. This research addresses the critical unmet need for a robust, clinically grounded integration of prompt optimization and retrieval filtering that explicitly models and validates the interplay between generated outputs and retrieved medical evidence, ensuring safer, more accurate, and interpretable NLP models in healthcare.",

Unlike existing methods that treat retrieval and prompting as independent or loosely coupled modules, our approach leverages model-based deep reinforcement learning with a clinician-in-the-loop proxy reward system, simulating domain expert feedback to more realistically and reliably guide the learning process. This integration addresses core challenges of accuracy, hallucination reduction, and interpretability trade-offs in medical NLP, offering a fundamentally more competitive and representative solution suited for safety-critical healthcare applications.

To overcome sparse clinical reward signals, the critic's reward function is bootstrapped using a clinician-in-the-loop simulated environment that employs surrogate metrics grounded in clinical decision support rules and gradient boosted tree models pre-trained on small but high-quality labeled datasets.

By bridging the gap between isolated NLP fairness frameworks and integrated multimodal clinical AI fairness stewardship, it aims to pioneer novel methodological contributions with broad applicability and translational impact in medical AI fairness research.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel, modular Cross-Domain Multimodal Pipeline Fairness Framework (CDMPFF) explicitly designed for clinical AI systems that process heterogeneous data types (clinical notes, imaging, structured EHR data). The framework decomposes the clinical AI pipeline into interconnected stages: Data Acquisition (multimodal sources), Data Preprocessing (domain-specific normalization and feature extraction), Representation Learning (using joint embedding techniques combining transformers for text and convolutional neural networks for imaging), Inference (task-specific predictive modeling), and Decision Support Actions (clinical recommendations or alerts).\n\nKey methodological innovations include:\n\n1. **Stage-Specific Bias Detection Algorithms:** We design and instantiate novel bias detection methods aligned to each pipeline stage and modality—e.g., intersectional subgroup performance metrics combining demographic attributes with imaging-derived features, calibration error disparities in phenotype prediction models, and pipeline-wide bias attribution via counterfactual perturbation techniques. These diagnostics leverage domain-adapted fairness metrics (e.g., clinical equal opportunity adjusted by patient risk profiles).\n\n2. **Integrated Bias Mitigation Interventions:** Each pipeline stage incorporates tailored mitigation algorithms—such as adversarial debiasing during joint representation learning, fairness-aware loss functions calibrated for clinical risks, and constrained optimization algorithms enforcing compliance with healthcare regulations (HIPAA, FDA guidelines). Mitigation strategies are designed to operate synergistically across modalities and stages, implemented via a coordination protocol enabling feedback propagation and tradeoff balancing.\n\n3. **Clinical Expert-In-The-Loop Feedback Integration:** We embed interactive feedback mechanisms whereby clinical experts can review bias diagnostics outputs via an explainable interface, input corrections, and validate mitigation outcomes. This human-in-the-loop design drives iterative refinement of fairness interventions, enriched by compliance constraints enforced via policy-driven automated checks.\n\n4. **Deployment-Aware Pipeline Orchestration:** The framework integrates monitoring modules that continuously track fairness metrics in operational clinical environments, enabling dynamic adjustment of mitigation algorithms responsive to data distribution shifts, evolving compliance requirements, and emergent biases.\n\nWe provide detailed algorithmic workflows and modular pseudocode for each stage, illustrating data flows, bias detection computations, mitigation application, expert feedback incorporation, and compliance enforcement, ensuring mechanistic transparency and replicability. This design distinctively advances prior ML fairness taxonomies by concretely adapting and extending them for complex, multimodal clinical AI pipelines under realistic deployment constraints, positioning CDMPFF as a transformative solution for trustworthy healthcare AI.",

Existing approaches often rely on monolithic taxonomies that inadequately capture jurisdictional variations and evolving norms, threatening both the validity and practical relevance of legal-ethical compliance guidance. This research therefore aims to develop a modular bias taxonomy explicitly designed to accommodate multiple legal frameworks—such as GDPR (EU), US civil rights laws, and other selected global statutes—and culturally contextual ethical principles. This scalable design enables precise, actionable guidance tailored per jurisdiction or domain, ensuring that NLP data augmentation respects nuanced legal boundaries and ethical diversity to mitigate systemic biases responsibly.",

This fusion of legal, ethical, and technical rigor addresses the competitive landscape by offering a dynamic, extensible, and granular approach to bias mitigation compliant with regionally diverse laws and ethical norms. It deepens societal relevance and technical novelty, fostering broader adoption and safer NLP applications worldwide.",

From this, derive compliance criteria modularized by jurisdiction and ethical context. Next, map these criteria onto dataset construction techniques—such as counterfactual generation and minority oversampling—via an extensible taxonomy with clearly delineated modules per region and ethical stance, facilitating maintainability and future updates. To operationalize the taxonomy, integrate automated, real-time compliance checking embedded within NLP data augmentation pipelines, powered by pre-trained language models fine-tuned to detect potential legal or ethical violations in synthetic data generation. Furthermore, implement adaptive machine unlearning methods to dynamically excise data elements identified as non-compliant or bias-inducing post-augmentation. This integrated framework thus enforces the taxonomy dynamically, ensuring both legal and fairness constraints are satisfied throughout the data lifecycle. Iterative co-design with multidisciplinary legal and ethical experts ensures both validity and applicability.",

Conduct iterative legal expert review sessions at defined milestones (e.g., post-taxonomy design, post-experimental evaluation) using structured decision protocols to validate compliance assessments and refine taxonomy modules.\n7. Evaluate the efficacy of integrated machine unlearning to erase identified non-compliant or bias-inducing augmentations and measure resulting impact on both legal compliance and fairness metrics.\n8.

Data Lineage Mapping: Analogous to biological sample provenance, we construct detailed lineage graphs encoding demographic and linguistic feature metadata (e.g., dialectal phonetic patterns, syntactic variants) stratified by minority subgroups. This lineage informs augmentation ancestry constraints to avoid spurious or out-of-distribution samples.  \n\n2. Sequence Authenticity Scoring: Inspired by microbial sequence authenticity assessments, we devise a multi-metric authenticity score combining language model perplexity (fine-tuned on subgroup-specific corpora), syntactic-semantic coherence measures, and fairness-impact heuristics. These authenticity scores act as continuous filters rejecting unrealistically generated augmentations.  \n\n3. Taxonomic Diversity Preservation: Mirroring microbial taxonomic diversity metrics, we define diversity indices across linguistic feature sets (e.g., lexical, phonological, syntactic) to guide augmentation diversity thresholds, ensuring expanded samples enrich rather than collapse minority subgroup linguistic variability.  \n\n4. Adaptive Augmentation Filters: An algorithmic framework dynamically combines lineage constraints, authenticity thresholds, and diversity indices via weighted optimization. This adaptive filter decides which synthetic samples to accept, iteratively calibrated by fairness metrics feedback (e.g., subgroup parity, equalized opportunity).  \n\n5. Counterfactual Generation Engine: Using a hybrid ML/linguistic rule-based generator enhanced by deep learning language models conditioned on subgroup metadata and controlled via the above filters, we produce counterfactual linguistic variants reflecting authentic minority dialectal traits without amplifying known biases.  \n\nWe provide detailed pseudo-code and algorithmic descriptions for each pipeline component, specifying input/output data formats, filter parameterization, and integration with fairness auditing modules, establishing a reproducible and scalable framework suitable for large, socially sensitive NLP datasets (e.g., Jigsaw, Bias in Bios).

Ablation Study Design: Systematically isolate and test the effect of each biological measure mapping (Lineage, Authenticity, Diversity) by removing one filter at a time and observing impacts on fairness and linguistic authenticity.  \n4. Metric Definition: Define quantitative metrics including:  \n- Fairness: subgroup parity gaps, equalized odds difference, counterfactual fairness metrics.  \n- Linguistic Authenticity: subgroup-specific perplexity reduction, syntactic-semantic coherence scores, and human-rated fluency via crowdsourcing with standardized guidelines and inter-annotator agreement measured via Cohen’s Kappa.  \n- Bias Amplification: measure bias leakage or exaggeration through calibrated bias classifiers.  \n- Computational Cost: record augmentation runtime, filter overhead, and scalability measures.  \n5.

Experimental Runs: Conduct experiments comparing the full pipeline, each ablated variant, and baselines; report mean and confidence intervals with statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests, bootstrap CIs).  \n7. Scalability Assessment: Evaluate pipeline runtime and effects on large-scale datasets with millions of instances, profiling bottlenecks and adaptive filter dynamics.  \n8. Fallback Plan Testing: Implement and evaluate the expert-curated linguistic rules combined with statistical resampling fallback; empirically contrast with full biological pipeline to assess trade-offs in fairness, interpretability, and runtime.  \n9.

Each augmented sentence passes the adaptive filter thresholds for lineage consistency (originates from confirmed AAVE data points), authenticity (low perplexity on AAVE fine-tuned language model), and diversity (linguistic variety across augmentations).  \nOutcome: The augmentation improves classification fairness metrics on subgroup-specific labels (e.g., reduces false negatives for toxicity detection) while maintaining high linguistic authenticity validated statistically and by human annotators. No amplification of group bias is detected via bias leakage analysis.  \nAdditional Test: Synthetic minority examples generated for Bias in Bios dataset produce realistic, legally compliant augmentations reflecting professional demographic traits without unrealistic or biased exaggerations.",

        "Problem_Statement": "Existing fairness benchmarks for clinical large language models (LLMs) predominantly focus on isolated technical metrics, neglecting the intertwined social, communicative, and organizational dimensions that substantially influence real-world fairness outcomes. This fragmentation leads to partial evaluations that fail to capture the complex, contextualized fairness issues emerging in clinical AI deployments.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work establishes technical fairness metrics and some social evaluations separately, integrating these heterogeneous dimensions into a unified, actionable platform remains an open research challenge. Our proposal addresses this gap by systematically harmonizing technical, social, communicative, and organizational fairness measures into a modular platform, leveraging federated natural language processing (NLP) methodologies to respect data privacy and foster broader collaboration. This approach not only pushes beyond incremental biomedical AI benchmarks but innovatively reconciles multi-domain fairness into coherent, validated insights, thus overcoming novelty competitiveness limitations of isolated methods and enabling intelligent decision-making for clinical AI governance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular experimental platform that quantitatively harmonizes heterogeneous fairness dimensions through a structured metric ontology and conflict resolution framework grounded in social science theory and technical standards. The core methodological innovations include: (1) a taxonomy-driven metric harmonization layer that maps and aligns technical fairness metrics (e.g., accuracy parity, bias amplification) with social perception indicators (e.g., trust indices from stakeholder surveys), communicative risk assessments (e.g., misinformation propagation scores via NLP-based media analysis), and organizational policy adherence simulations; (2) conflict detection and resolution mechanisms employing weighted multi-criteria decision analysis to resolve incompatible signals; (3) use of federated learning approaches for privacy-preserving aggregation of diverse stakeholder data and media textual sources from distributed clinical and media partners; and (4) incremental validation pipelines verifying interpretability and ecological validity through stepwise pilot modules. These modules initially focus on integrating clinical workflow embedding and stakeholder trust, extending progressively to media dynamics and organizational policy simulations. The platform incorporates intelligent decision-making support by synthesizing composite fairness scores to guide biomedical LLM refinements. This design explicitly ensures interpretability, conflict transparency, and extensibility, surpassing traditional fairness evaluations by bridging cross-disciplinary gaps.",

Statistical fairness metrics are contextually augmented with semantic ethical assessments, where conflicts among norms trigger transparent, rule-based prioritization and rationale generation to support interpretable audit outputs. This method quantifiably adjusts fairness violation scores by weighting or overriding statistical signals based on normative conflicts. For example, if a statistical bias violates both non-discrimination law and hospital ethics, the framework escalates the severity score and generates specific rectification recommendations, explaining their legal and ethical basis. Real-time audit reports feature justifiable decisions reconciling conflicting norms, facilitating trust and regulatory compliance in complex smart hospital environments.

By explicitly grounding our approach in cognitive science theories of human-computer interaction and iterative learning, we hypothesize that semantic prompt refinement driven by domain experts will outperform fully automated prompt methods under these data imbalance conditions, boosting both accuracy and user trust. This HITL approach complements and extends automated tuning baselines with principled expert-guided corrections, addressing gaps in software engineering contexts unfulfilled by existing work.

We extend traditional analogy from neural network-based parametric design to parametric prompt design, learning and updating prompt parameters with each HITL feedback iteration. Computational resource use is optimized via focused query selection and prompt update heuristics to balance accuracy and complexity. To quantify human factors impact, we operationalize \"human trust indices\" by combining multiple validated measures: perceived system reliability (System Usability Scale), trust calibration questionnaires adapted for interactive AI, and behavioral trust proxies such as time spent reviewing and feedback conformity rates.

        "Problem_Statement": "Current Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) employ deterministic attention mechanisms that inadequately capture the underlying stochastic temporal dependencies and arrival dynamics inherent in sequential data. This limitation hampers their ability to maintain sequence fidelity and adaptively allocate computational resources, especially under efficiency constraints and noise perturbations.",
        "Motivation": "While existing LLM attention mechanisms focus on static similarity scoring, they do not explicitly model temporal stochasticity in input sequences, a gap palpable in domains like biomedical sequencing and financial time series. By integrating Markovian Arrival Processes (MAPs), a probabilistic framework traditionally used in modeling event arrivals in stochastic systems, into Transformer attention, we introduce a novel, dynamic, and theoretically grounded attention mechanism. This approach offers a fundamentally new probabilistic interpretation and control of attention distributions, facilitating both improved sequence fidelity and computational efficiency. Furthermore, by blending concepts from semantic extraction and neural ordinary differential equations, our method enriches the model's temporal and semantic context awareness, distinguishing it from prior competitive approaches.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a MAP-guided attention mechanism that parameterizes attention weights as stochastic arrival rates modulated by learned Markovian states representing context-dependent sequence dynamics. Formally, at each attention head, the unnormalized attention score between query q_i and key k_j is defined as S_{ij} = \\lambda_{ij} \\cdot \\exp( (q_i \\cdot k_j^T) / \\sqrt{d_k} ), where \\lambda_{ij} is the MAP-derived stochastic arrival rate defined by the current Markovian state transitions. The MAP is modeled as a continuous-time Markov chain with states representing latent arrival intensities; its transition probability matrix and state-dependent arrival rates are parameterized as differentiable neural modules trained end-to-end via backpropagation. We normalize attention weights using a MAP-modulated softmax: \\alpha_{ij} = \\frac{\\lambda_{ij} \\exp( (q_i \\cdot k_j^T) / \\sqrt{d_k} )}{\\sum_{m} \\lambda_{im} \\exp( (q_i \\cdot k_m^T) / \\sqrt{d_k} )}. Furthermore, to enforce computational efficiency, we define a dynamic inference-time pruning threshold \\tau based on the MAP arrival probabilities; attention weights below \\tau are pruned, effectively ignoring low-probability dependencies. This threshold can be adaptively learned or scheduled during inference. The entire MAP layer integrates gradient flow through stochastic states using the reparameterization trick combined with neural ordinary differential equations to model continuous state dynamics, ensuring stable training.

Conventional federated learning faces communication inefficiencies and struggles with non-IID data distributions, while data distillation has yet to be fully leveraged in this context.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses internal gaps around privacy, data scarcity, and federated learning limitations, and exploits the hidden bridge between clinical data distillation and cybersecurity datasets, by integrating privacy-preserving synthetic data distillation into federated intrusion detection training frameworks for resource-constrained edge devices.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel framework combining federated learning with locally generated synthetic data distillation. Each client distills its sensitive local intrusion detection dataset into a compressed, privacy-preserving synthetic dataset via generative models guided by differential privacy. These synthetic datasets are communicated instead of raw data or gradients, improving communication efficiency and privacy. The central server aggregates distilled synthetic data summaries to train a global intrusion detection model. The approach incorporates adaptability to heterogeneous client distributions and models parameter size constraints through lightweight hybrid transformer-RNN architectures tailored for edge deployment.",

        "title": "Adaptive Federated Reinforced Synthetic Data Distillation for Privacy-Preserving IoT Intrusion Detection under Heterogeneous Non-IID Conditions",
        "Problem_Statement": "Deploying large-scale, privacy-aware intrusion detection systems for IoT networks involves unique challenges owing to highly heterogeneous, non-IID data distributions, stringent privacy constraints on sensitive local data, communication bottlenecks, and limited computational resources on edge devices. Traditional federated learning approaches struggle to ensure robust global model convergence and adaptability under these conditions, especially given the evolving nature of IoT traffic as temporal sequences and emerging attack behaviors. Additionally, while synthetic data distillation can reduce communication overhead and protect privacy, systematic mechanisms to aggregate diverse, privacy-budgeted synthetic datasets for stable federated training are lacking. Therefore, there is a critical need for an adaptive federated learning framework that integrates privacy-preserving synthetic data distillation with temporal anomaly detection and dynamic reinforcement learning-based client optimization to tackle non-IID data heterogeneity, resource constraints, and evolving intrusion patterns in IoT environments.",
        "Motivation": "This work seeks to advance privacy-aware federated intrusion detection by addressing two key gaps: (1) the absence of rigorous mechanisms to harmonize heterogeneous synthetic distilled datasets aggregated under diverse privacy budgets ensuring stable and unbiased global model training in non-IID, resource-constrained IoT settings; and (2) the under-explored potential of leveraging time-series anomaly detection and reinforcement learning to dynamically adapt federated learning strategies per client context and temporal traffic patterns. By integrating these elements, our approach extends beyond existing federated synthetic data distillation methods to produce a novel, efficient, and resilient intrusion detection framework tailored to next-generation IoT edge-AI deployments. This integration uniquely enhances privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and detection robustness, positioning the work competitively within current research frontiers and demonstrating broad applicability for resilient cybersecurity in distributed systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel Adaptive Federated Reinforced Synthetic Data Distillation (AFR-SDD) framework combining the following elements: (1) Locally at each edge client, sensitive intrusion detection datasets—modeled as temporal sequences—are distilled into compact, privacy-preserving synthetic datasets using generative time-series anomaly detection models integrated with differential privacy mechanisms. Clients maintain heterogeneous, bounded privacy budgets adjusted dynamically via a client-side reinforcement learning (RL) agent, which optimizes the trade-off between privacy, synthetic data quality, and resource consumption by observing local intrusion pattern changes and resource availability over time. (2) To address heterogeneity and non-IID distributions, the central server employs a formalized synthetic data aggregation mechanism that 1) weights incoming synthetic datasets based on estimated generative quality and privacy budgets, 2) filters potential biases/noise using robust statistical aggregation and representation alignment techniques, and 3) incrementally updates a global intrusion detection model using a hybrid lightweight transformer-RNN architecture optimized for time-series data. This ensures model convergence and stability despite client variability. (3) The global model updates and policies from the central server are transmitted back to clients; the clients’ RL agents use these insights to refine local synthetic data distillation parameters adaptively, enabling context-aware, temporally sensitive federated learning cycles. This closed-loop dynamic synergy enables efficient, privacy-preserving, and scalable intrusion detection suited for diverse IoT environments with constrained communication and compute budgets.",

The RL agent adjusts local differential privacy parameters and synthetic data generation quality in real-time based on resource availability and anomaly detections. The distilled synthetic time-series datasets, anonymized and compressed, are transmitted to the central server. Output: The federatedly trained global intrusion detection model—updated through robust aggregation of heterogeneous synthetic datasets—achieves high detection accuracy (>95%) for known and emerging attacks, maintains strong privacy guarantees (formal DP bounds), reduces communication overhead by >50% compared to gradient sharing, and adapts dynamically to changing IoT network traffic patterns. The model runs efficiently on resource-limited edge devices, enabling real-time flagging of malicious activities across distributed nodes while preserving user privacy and system scalability.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If synthetic data distillation yields inferior detection performance due to generative quality limitations or RL optimization convergence issues, fallback strategies include: (1) Hybrid communication schemes combining distilled synthetic data with compressed gradient or model update summaries, augmented by robust privacy-preserving data augmentation techniques to enhance representativeness. (2) Employ secure multi-party computation for aggregated model updates to reinforce privacy without synthetic data dependency. (3) Simplify RL agents to heuristic-based privacy-utility tuning or pre-defined schedules; (4) Refine privacy budgets and generative model architectures through targeted hyperparameter tuning informed by detailed privacy leakage and performance audits until stability and accuracy targets are met. Debugging will focus on privacy budget exactness, generative model fidelity, and aggregation mechanism correctness, with fallback to more classical federated learning paradigms as necessary to maintain privacy-compliant detection capabilities under resource constraints."
