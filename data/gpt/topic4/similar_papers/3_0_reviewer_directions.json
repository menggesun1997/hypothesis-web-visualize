    "title": "Community-Driven Privacy Adaptive LLMs for Urdu-speaking Telehealth Users",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM privacy-preserving methods lack cultural sensitivity and transparency, limiting adoption within Urdu-speaking healthcare communities, especially in telehealth contexts where linguistic diversity and data privacy must be balanced.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the internal gap of limited customization and transparency in LLMs for equitable healthcare adoption, while leveraging the external gap spotlighting community-based participatory research and privacy preservation for low-resource languages like Urdu.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a participatory framework that co-designs LLM fine-tuning pipelines integrating community feedback loops with privacy-preserving federated learning techniques. This integrates culturally-aware privacy policies and localized paraphrase detection to dynamically adapt privacy-utility trade-offs. The architecture allows community representatives to guide data usage policies, ensuring transparency and equitable LLM behavior for Urdu telehealth users.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect Urdu health dialogue datasets via community consent. 2. Fine-tune existing LLMs using federated learning with adaptive compression techniques. 3. Implement feedback modules for community participants to evaluate privacy and utility. 4. Compare against baseline LLMs without participatory design on metrics: privacy leakage, accuracy in paraphrase detection, and user trust surveys. 5. Perform ablation on privacy policies' transparency effects.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient message in Urdu mentioning a sensitive health condition. Expected output: LLM generates responses preserving privacy (e.g., redacting identifiers while maintaining medical relevance). User feedback indicates improved trust and cultural appropriateness compared to standard models.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated learning shows limited convergence, fallback to secure multi-party computation for model updates; if community feedback integration delays training, use simulated community preferences or proxy cultural metrics."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a participatory framework integrating community feedback loops with federated learning and adaptive privacy policies. However, the mechanism needs clearer technical elaboration: it is unclear how community representatives' inputs are operationalized within the LLM fine-tuning pipeline. Specifically, the pipeline should explicitly describe how feedback influences the federated learning updates, privacy budget allocation, and paraphrase detection models. Clarifying this interaction between community input and model adaptation will strengthen the soundness and replicability of the approach, ensuring transparent mapping between cultural privacy requirements and technical model behavior adjustments. Consider including concrete algorithmic steps or architectural diagrams to resolve this ambiguity in the method design section (Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan includes data collection, federated fine-tuning, community feedback, and evaluation metrics. However, federated learning for low-resource languages like Urdu in telehealth settings can be highly challenging due to limited data availability, network constraints, and convergence issues. The fallback to secure multi-party computation is a sound alternative but may introduce scalability bottlenecks. It is recommended to strengthen the experimental feasibility by clearly detailing how community consent and participant recruitment will be operationalized at scale, and including preliminary empirical or simulation evidence indicating expected convergence rates and communication overheads for federated training in this context. This will improve the methodological feasibility and increase confidence in the proposed experiment plan's practicality."
