    "title": "Culturally Sensitive Privacy Metrics for Dynamic User Control in LLM Healthcare Applications",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current privacy metrics applied in LLMs do not reflect cultural variations in privacy expectations, reducing trust and equitable technology adoption in diverse linguistic groups like Urdu speakers in telemedicine.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap of limited transparency and customization in privacy-preserving LLM pathways by embedding culturally informed privacy metrics and personalized control mechanisms, a novel sociotechnical approach.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a culturally adaptive privacy scoring system that maps community-driven privacy concerns into formal privacy budget parameters for LLM training/inference. Integrate a user-facing control panel that allows patients to specify privacy preferences influencing local model behavior dynamically, mediated through continuous learning to balance privacy-utility trade-offs respecting cultural norms.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Conduct participatory studies to elicit privacy norms from Urdu-speaking communities. 2. Formalize cultural privacy metrics translating qualitative inputs into quantitative privacy parameters. 3. Implement adaptive LLM inference controlled by these metrics. 4. Evaluate via simulated telehealth sessions measuring privacy preservation, model utility, and user satisfaction.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User marks certain health topics as highly sensitive. Expected output: LLM response generation excludes sensitive information with enhanced obfuscation, validated by user trust ratings.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cultural privacy preferences cannot be reliably quantified, fallback to region-based heuristic privacy profiles; if adaptive control degrades model utility, implement post-hoc sanitization layers."

          "feedback_content": "The 'Proposed_Method' outlines a culturally adaptive privacy scoring system and a user-facing control panel dynamically influencing LLM inference, yet it lacks sufficient clarity and detail on how community-driven qualitative privacy concerns will be rigorously and reproducibly transformed into formal privacy budget parameters. Additionally, the integration of continuous learning to balance privacy-utility trade-offs respecting cultural norms is ambitious but underspecified. Providing a clear, principled algorithmic description or framework describing the mapping from cultural inputs to privacy parameters and how feedback loops with the LLM inference operate is essential to substantiate the soundness of the approach and enable reproducibility and comparison with existing privacy methods in LLMs. This would strengthen the theoretical grounding and practical implementation roadmap significantly, reducing ambiguity in core mechanisms and assumptions underlying this sociotechnical method, and thereby improving confidence in its feasibility and evaluation criteria. Please elaborate the mechanism with pseudocode or formal definitions where possible, and clarify assumptions about community input reliability, granularity, and representation within the privacy framework to solidify this key contribution point (Proposed_Method). This clarity is crucial as cultural metrics for privacy are conceptually rich and complex, demanding thoughtful formalization to translate them effectively for LLM privacy control applications in healthcare contexts where user trust is paramount.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' logically progresses from participatory elicitation of cultural privacy norms to quantitative metric formalization and adaptive LLM integration, culminating in telehealth simulation evaluations. However, it lacks important details essential for feasibility and reproducibility: How will participants for elicitation be recruited and sampled to ensure representative, unbiased privacy norm data in Urdu-speaking communities? How will qualitative data be systematically coded and validated to guarantee reliable translation into quantitative privacy parameters? What are the criteria for measuring ‘privacy preservation’, ‘utility’, and ‘user satisfaction’ in the telehealth simulations, and how will these be balanced or traded off in evaluation metrics? The plan should also specify validation methodologies such as inter-rater reliability in coding, ethics and consent protocols for participatory studies, baselines and control conditions for LLM adaptivity experiments, and power analyses to estimate needed sample sizes. Given the novelty and sociotechnical complexity, pilot studies should be explicitly mentioned to test initial assumptions on parameter mappings and control panel usability. Articulating these methodological details will increase confidence in the plan’s feasibility and scientific rigor and aid in transparent, reproducible validation of cultural privacy metrics in healthcare LLM applications (Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and the rich sociotechnical nature of the work, leveraging globally-linked concepts could strongly boost impact and novelty. Specifically, integrating principles from 'human-centered computing' and 'human-computer interaction research' can deepen the design of the user-facing control panel by incorporating adaptive interface adaptation and design interaction techniques, improving accessibility and trust across linguistic and cultural diversity. Additionally, linking with 'intelligent agents' and 'intelligent computing' concepts could allow the system to proactively suggest privacy settings based on learned user behavior and contextual cues, thereby simplifying user effort and enhancing transparency. Finally, drawing from 'application of AI' and 'healthcare innovation' could support collaboration with clinical stakeholders in iterative co-design, ensuring not only technical feasibility but also ethical and practical deployment in telemedicine settings. Explicitly embedding cross-disciplinary methods and evaluation frameworks from these domains will augment the important contribution of culturally grounded privacy metrics, enabling the research to stand out within a competitive field and advance socially responsible AI for healthcare."
