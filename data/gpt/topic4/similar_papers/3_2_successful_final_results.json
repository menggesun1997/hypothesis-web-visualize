    "Problem_Statement": "There is a gap in frameworks that integrate multimodal linguistic data (text, voice) from culturally diverse populations securely into LLM training while preserving privacy and localization in healthcare delivery.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the internal gap on real-world validation of privacy-preserving methods beyond text-only datasets, focusing on cross-modal, culturally tailored datasets; bridges gaps in telemedicine multilingual data collection and privacy.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a federated learning pipeline where multi-modal data (spoken Urdu, written health notes) are locally preprocessed to extract linguistic features and anonymized embeddings, encrypted for secure aggregation. The LLM fine-tuning adapts to each modality distinctly with privacy budgets controlling contribution per participant. Incorporate culturally relevant prompts via participatory design.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multimodal datasets from Urdu-speaking patients (audio + text). 2. Implement on-device pre-processing pipelines for anonymization. 3. Train federated LLMs with privacy budgets. 4. Measure downstream health dialog task accuracy, privacy leakage, and cross-modal coherence. 5. Compare to centralized and unimodal training baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient query recorded via voice in Urdu along with typed health history. Expected output: Accurate multi-modal response supporting clinical decision with zero recovery of raw identifiable data.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated learning multi-modal fusion is unstable, separately train modality-specific sub-models with ensemble fusion; if privacy budget constraints reduce accuracy excessively, explore adaptive privacy budget allocation per modality."

        "title": "Multi-Modal Privacy-Aware Federated LLM Framework with Detailed Mechanisms for Culturally Tailored Health Communication in Urdu-Speaking Telemedicine Populations",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current frameworks lack rigorous and fully specified methodologies for securely integrating multimodal linguistic data (text and voice) from culturally diverse, resource-constrained populations into large language model (LLM) training pipelines, while ensuring stringent privacy preservation, clinical utility, and localization in healthcare delivery—especially for telemedicine involving Urdu speakers. This gap impedes effective, culturally tailored AI-driven health communication that respects patient privacy and heterogeneous device capabilities.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work explores federated learning and privacy in healthcare LLMs, few concretely address multi-modal fusion with rigorous privacy budgeting across modalities, heterogeneous device constraints, and cultural tailoring through participatory design—all within a unified, transparent, and reproducible framework. Our approach advances the state-of-the-art by explicitly detailing model architecture, privacy-preserving transformations, and federated aggregation mechanisms for voice-text fusion under privacy constraints, fulfilling the urgent need for trustworthy AI that enhances telemedicine quality in underserved linguistic communities. Incorporation of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for medical text analysis and convolutional neural networks for audio feature extraction integrates intelligent computing methods directly applicable to clinical dialog, improving diagnostic and communication efficacy.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a federated learning architecture integrating modality-specific encoders and a shared LLM backbone fine-tuned with encrypted, anonymized embeddings under strict privacy budgets. Specifically: \n\n1. Local preprocessing extracts modality-specific features—CNN-based mel-spectrogram embeddings for voice and transformer-based contextual embeddings for text—using lightweight on-device models optimized for resource-constrained hardware. \n2. Anonymization employs differential privacy mechanisms (e.g., Gaussian noise addition calibrated per modality) to obfuscate sensitive identifiers while preserving clinical semantics essential for downstream tasks. \n3. Privacy budgets are adaptively allocated per modality based on utility-impact curves derived from preliminary sensitivity analyses, ensuring balanced contribution without compromising privacy guarantees. \n4. Modality fusion on-device conducts feature alignment via cross-modal attention modules facilitating coherent embeddings before secure aggregation.\n5. Federated averaging aggregates encrypted updates using secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols with communication compression techniques to reduce overhead.\n6. Participatory design integrates continual culturally relevant prompt refinement via iterative expert and patient feedback loops, quantitatively benchmarked by alignment scores and user acceptability metrics to tailor model responses.\n\nWe include detailed architecture diagrams and pseudo-code illustrating the local-to-global training flow, privacy transformation pipelines, and fusion modules to ensure reproducibility and soundness.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Patient Recruitment & Ethical Compliance: Partner with healthcare institutions and community leaders in Urdu-speaking regions ensuring culturally sensitive informed consent and ethical approvals.\n2. Data Collection: Acquire a diverse multimodal dataset (targeting 1000+ participants) comprising voice queries and typed health notes covering varied clinical contexts.\n3. On-Device Implementation: Deploy optimized CNN and transformer encoders on representative low-end devices for benchmarking preprocessing latency, energy consumption, and anonymization efficacy.\n4. Federated Training: Train the multi-modal LLM with adaptive privacy budgets using secure aggregation over a 12-week period, simulating real-world communication delays and dropout rates.\n5. Evaluation Metrics & Analysis:\n   - Clinical accuracy: Precision and recall on downstream dialog understanding and decision support tasks.\n   - Privacy leakage: Empirically assess via membership inference attacks and evaluate empirical privacy loss metrics.\n   - Communication overhead & scalability: Measure MPC protocol runtime and data transmission volumes.\n   - Cultural tailoring: Use quantitative alignment metrics and user acceptability surveys collected in iterative prompt refinements.\n6. Comparison Baselines: Centralized multi-modal training, unimodal federated models for text and audio separately, and state-of-the-art non-federated privacy-preserving LLMs.\n7. Failure Recovery & Robustness: Simulate data heterogeneity, device failures, and privacy budget overruns with defined fallback mechanisms (modality-specific sub-model ensembles).\n8. Project Timeline & Resources: Detailed Gantt chart covering recruitment, development, training, and evaluation phases with resource allocation including computational and human expertise.\n\nAll experiment steps leverage best practices in medical text analysis, activity recognition from audio, and human emotion detection for nuanced clinical dialog modeling.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Case 1 Input: A voice-recorded Urdu patient symptom query describing chest pain variations combined with typed notes on medical history.\nExpected Output: An accurate, contextually relevant multi-modal response providing clinical decision support without any recoverable personally identifiable information (PII), demonstrated by differential privacy metrics and attack resistance tests.\n\nCase 2 Input: Multimodal health dialog inputs with colloquial Urdu expressions and code-switching.\nExpected Output: Culturally sensitive and linguistically tailored LLM-generated advice validated through user acceptability scores and alignment to expert feedback.\n\nCase 3 Input: Partial-input scenarios with missing modality (e.g., only text or audio).\nExpected Output: Modality-fused system degrades gracefully via ensemble fallback models, maintaining privacy budgets and clinical utility within defined thresholds.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the integrated multimodal federated fusion proves unstable or computationally prohibitive on resource-constrained devices, we will: \n\n1. Develop modality-specific federated sub-models (text-only and audio-only) trained independently with optimized privacy budgets.\n2. Employ ensemble fusion strategies at the server-side, combining independent predictions while respecting privacy constraints.\n3. Explore dynamic adaptive privacy budget allocation informed by real-time utility metrics to balance accuracy and privacy.\n4. Incorporate transfer learning from well-resourced languages or modalities to bootstrap under-resourced ones.\n5. Increase use of secure hardware enclaves or edge-cloud hybrid computations if on-device preprocessing is insufficient.\nThese fallback adaptations will be rigorously benchmarked against defined accuracy, privacy leak, and cultural acceptability criteria to ensure objective evaluation and retention of clinical relevance."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a federated learning pipeline combining multi-modal data with privacy budgets and participatory design. However, the core mechanism of how modality-specific fine-tuning integrates with federated aggregation and privacy controls remains vague. Clarify how the privacy budget is allocated across modalities, how anonymized embeddings preserve clinical utility without leaking sensitive info, and the technical flow from local preprocessing to global LLM updates. Providing a detailed architecture diagram or pseudo-code will strengthen soundness and reproducibility evaluation. Address potential challenges like voice-text feature alignment and modality fusion within federated constraints explicitly in the proposal to validate feasibility assumptions more robustly while ensuring privacy guarantees are upheld effectively at scale and in heterogeneous cultural settings. This clarity is vital to justify the approach's technical soundness beyond conceptual novelty and determine precise risk-benefit tradeoffs, which are critical here due to health data sensitivity and multi-modal complexity involved in federated LLM adaptation for telemedicine contexts to diverse patient populations such as Urdu speakers with cultural tailoring requirements now described at a high level only but needing concrete mechanistic explication for peer validation and impact assessment accuracy confirmation on downstream clinical tasks under privacy constraints. Recommending elaboration on the exact federated learning model architecture, privacy-preserving transformation methods, and modality fusion techniques as concrete method descriptions in the updated proposal document is necessary to elevate the study from a promising conceptual framework to a fully vetted scientific method with adequate technical rigor for implementation and community replication attempts at a premier conference standard level. See this as critical for validating the study's internal logic consistency, methodological rigor, and also safeguarding patient data trustworthiness during experimentation and real-world deployment phases envisaged in the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan and Test_Case_Examples sections, as insufficient detail here could undermine feasibility judgments and potential real-world translational success despite the innovative idea locus in a highly competitive research landscape where many works exist on federated and privacy-preserving LLM training but rarely for multi-modal culturally localized telemedicine applications incorporating participatory design, making explicit the method's novelty and concrete soundness fundamentals paramount for credibility and impact evaluations here, to retain the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty forecast and avoid rejection on technical grounds despite a timely and socially valuable research topic being tackled comprehensively otherwise but only superficially specified methodologically presently in the proposal."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan proposes multimodal Urdu patient data collection, local anonymization, federated training with privacy budgets, and evaluation against centralized and unimodal baselines. However, it lacks concrete operational details critical for feasibility, such as specifics on patient recruitment strategy respecting cultural ethics, data quantity and diversity needed for robust model training, practical limitations of on-device preprocessing capabilities (especially for potentially computationally intensive anonymization and embedding extraction on resource-constrained devices common in targeted demographics), and precise metrics and methodologies for privacy leakage assessment. It is important to specify the secure aggregation protocols envisaged, communication overheads, potential data heterogeneity effects, and failure recovery mechanisms in federated learning scenarios expected. Also, how the participatory design will concretely influence prompt engineering or cultural tailoring and how these will be quantitatively measured or benchmarked should be detailed to ensure scientific rigor and reproducibility. These clarifications are essential to confirm the plan's scientific robustness, technological feasibility, and ethical robustness, particularly considering patient privacy in health data contexts and resource variability in Urdu-speaking telemedicine users. Without these, the experiment plan risks being overly optimistic or underspecified, threatening both implementation success and the validity of impact claims. Adding a timeline, projected resource needs, and fallback experimental setups with predefined evaluation criteria for precision, recall, privacy leak rates, and user acceptability in culturally tailored health communication scenarios will better scaffold feasibility and increase confidence in the practical viability of the framework with realistic constraints."
