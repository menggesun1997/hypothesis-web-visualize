    "title": "Multimodal Federated Language Adaptation with Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current FL approaches focus on unimodal biomedical data and ignore the challenge of adapting multilingual foundation models on diverse data modalities under privacy constraints.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses critical gap of lacking cross-modal adaptation methods in federated contexts, leveraging hidden bridges from multimodal distillation and cross-lingual transfer learning.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Propose a federated multimodal distillation framework where unimodal client models (text, image, signal) locally learn modality-specific representations and distill knowledge into a shared multilingual FM server model via encrypted soft-label transmissions. Language adaptation happens through auxiliary language embeddings fused with modality representations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Collect paired multimodal biomedical datasets (clinical text, diagnostic images) across multiple languages. Use LLaMa variants augmented with modality encoders. Compare to unimodal FL baselines without distillation. Evaluate on cross-modal entity recognition and diagnosis support tasks, measuring privacy preservation and linguistic adaptation quality.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical text in French with corresponding X-ray images; Output: Federated model predicting diagnosis improved by cross-modal distillation respecting language diversity and data privacy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If distillation is ineffective, explore hierarchical FL hierarchy separating modalities or fallback to modality-agnostic language adaptation."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a federated multimodal distillation framework with encrypted soft-label transmissions and auxiliary language embeddings to fuse modality and language information. However, the mechanism for securely aligning unimodal representations across heterogeneous modalities and languages is underspecified. Details on how knowledge distillation effectively preserves privacy while maintaining cross-modal and cross-lingual alignment, especially given the encrypted soft labels, are missing. Clarify how encryption affects the fidelity of distillation, and how modality and language embeddings are integrated without leakage or performance degradation. Providing a more explicit technical description or schematic of these interactions will strengthen soundness and the feasibility of implementation at scale in realistic federated environments, particularly in biomedical domains with strict privacy constraints and diverse modalities like clinical text and images. This is critical to dispel doubts about the core mechanism's viability and security trade-offs in this complex multimodal federated setting (Proposed_Method)."

However, the plan lacks concrete detail on dataset availability, preprocessing pipelines for heterogeneous modalities and languages, and the integration approach for auxiliary language embeddings. Given the difficulty of assembling multilingual, multimodal biomedical datasets, the plan should incorporate a clearer strategy for data sourcing, handling distributional heterogeneity, privacy-preserving data simulation (if real data is limited), and baseline comparisons. Also, metrics to evaluate privacy preservation, linguistic adaptation quality, and cross-modal distillation effectiveness must be explicitly listed. Without these refinements, it risks being impractical and under-evaluative. Strengthening the experimental rigor with publicly available biomedical multimodal datasets or well-justified synthetic alternatives will enhance feasibility and confidence in results (Experiment_Plan)."

By addressing computational constraints and communication costs in federated learning across hospital edge nodes, your method could simultaneously push the frontier of biomedical NLP and federated vision-language modeling under practical constraints. Moreover, incorporating structured electronic health records (EHR) as a complementary modality could broaden impact and demonstrate applicability to comprehensive biomedical data fusion. Such integration aligns with the growing demand for privacy-preserving, scalable multimodal healthcare AI and may elevate the proposal from NOV-COMPETITIVE to a more differentiated contribution (overall proposal)."
