    "title": "Transparent Human-AI Co-Designed Fairness Evaluation for Multilingual LLM Pipelines",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current bias evaluation frameworks for multilingual LLMs lack transparency, scalability, and human oversight, failing to integrate psychological implicit bias tests with fairness metrics in a coherent pipeline.",
    "Motivation": "This proposal targets internal gaps around scalable, transparent frameworks for bias mitigation with human-in-the-loop co-design, aligning with Opportunity 2 by synthesizing psychological implicit bias detection and multimodal fairness evaluation for sensitive multilingual applications.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular fairness evaluation platform that combines LLM word association implicit bias tests with fairness metrics adapted from multimodal mental health analyses. The platform incorporates interactive visualizations and human expert feedback loops to iteratively refine bias detection and mitigation. Co-designed workflows enable ethicists and domain experts to steer evaluation priorities according to cultural and linguistic contexts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multilingual LLMs and relevant datasets in sensitive domains. 2) Implement psychological-inspired implicit bias tests and multimodal fairness metrics as modular components. 3) Integrate human-in-the-loop interfaces for feedback and transparency. 4) Conduct user studies with ethicists and AI developers. 5) Measure improvements in bias detection sensitivity and stakeholder trust metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM embeddings tested for association biases with ethnic or gendered terms across languages. Output: Transparent bias scores with human annotations indicating false positives or cultural nuances.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If human co-design is resource-intensive, fallback to semi-automated bias report generation with extensive documentation and guidelines for ethical oversight."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed modular fairness evaluation platform combines psychological implicit bias tests with multimodal fairness metrics adapted from mental health analyses but lacks a detailed explanation of how these diverse metrics will be coherently integrated technically and conceptually within multilingual LLM pipelines. Clarify the data flow, interoperability of components, and how human feedback iteratively influences bias detection refinement at a granular level to strengthen the method's clarity and soundness. Additionally, explicitly state how cultural and linguistic contexts are operationalized within the co-designed workflows to avoid vague assumptions about human-in-the-loop efficacy and relevance across languages and cultures, which is critical given the multilingual focus of the study. This will help reviewers and future users understand and reproduce the system effectively, improving the soundness of the proposal’s mechanism section (Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_content": "To enhance novelty and impact beyond the competitive core area of bias evaluation, consider integrating methodologies from computational political science and information retrieval to expand the platform’s use case. For example, embedding retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or multi-agent system simulations could allow the platform to evaluate how biases influence downstream decision-making in socio-political or security-related applications. This could situate the research within broader practical contexts, such as monitoring misinformation or hate speech propagation in multilingual environments, linking with the listed globally-linked concepts and providing concrete, scalable evaluation outputs that appeal to interdisciplinary stakeholders and augment the platform’s originality and impact potential."
