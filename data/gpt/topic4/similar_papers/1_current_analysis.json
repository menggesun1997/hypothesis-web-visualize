The volume explores a wide range of applied contexts, such as digital linguistic injustice, critical digital literacy, digital learning, digital publishing, low-resourced, minoritised or endangered languages in a digital space, and multilingual historical intertextuality. These discussions are situated within wider work on language technologies, language documentation, and international (in particular European) language-based infrastructure creation. Drawing on both primary and secondary research, this four-part book features 13 diverse case studies of infrastructural projects, pedagogical resources, computational models, interface building, and publishing initiatives in a range of languages, including Arabic, French, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, German, Spanish, Bengali, Hindi, Malayalam, and Tamil. All the debates are contextualised within a wider cultural frame, thus bridging the gap between the linguistic focus of the multilingual initiatives and wider discussion of cultural criticism in DH. Multilingual Digital Humanities recognises the digital as a culturally situated and organic multilingual entity embedding past, present, and future worlds, which reacts to and impacts on institutional and methodological frameworks for knowledge creation. It is essential reading for students, scholars, and practitioners working in digital humanities and digital studies.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Text, Speech, and Dialogue, 25th International Conference, TSD 2022, Brno, Czech Republic, September 6–9, 2022, Proceedings', 'abstract': 'This book constitutes the proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Text, Speech, and Dialogue, TSD 2022, held in Brno, Czech Republic, in September 2022.

The fabric of the EU linguistic landscape comprises 24 official languages and over 60 regional and minority languages. However, language barriers still hamper communication and the free flow of information. Multilingualism is a key cultural cornerstone of Europe, signifying what it means to be and to feel European. Various studies and resolutions have found a striking imbalance in the support of Europe’s languages through technologies, issuing a call to action. Following an introduction, the book is divided into two parts. The first part describes the state of the art of language technology and language-centric AI and the definition and metrics developed to measure digital language equality. It also presents the status quo in 2022/2023, i.e., the current level of technology support for over 30 European languages. The second part describes plans and recommendations on how to bring about digital language equality in Europe by 2030. It includes chapters on the setup and results of the community consultation process, four technical deep dives, an overview of existing strategic documents and an abridged version of the strategic agenda and roadmap. The recommendations have been prepared jointly with the European community in the fields of language technology, natural language processing, and language-centric AI, as well as with representatives of relevant initiatives and associations, language communities and regional and minority language groups. Ensuring appropriate technology support for all European languages will not only create jobs, growth and opportunities in the digital single market. Overcoming language barriers in the digital environment is also essential for an inclusive society and for providing unity in diversity for many years to come.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence, Special Sessions I, 20th International Conference', 'abstract': 'The present book brings together experience, current work, and promising future trends associated with distributed computing, artificial intelligence, and their application in order to provide efficient solutions to real problems.

The volume explores the ideological constructs behind MT as a labor-saving technology, how these constructs are embedded in both its development and social reception, and how they manifest in biased outputs. The chapters cover the cultural roots of translation automation, its legal and political implications, and the needs of various stakeholders. These stakeholders include lay users, Indigenous communities, institutions, educators, and professionals in an increasingly multicultural society. The book also addresses individuals who require translation daily with varying degrees of familiarity with their own translation needs and the tools available. Through critical engagement with the social impacts of MT, the book advocates for an epistemology of care to foster social equity and democratic values in technological progress. This book will interest scholars in translation studies, law, and sociotechnology, as well as practicing translators, policymakers, technologists, and activists seeking ethical and inclusive approaches to machine translation and technological development.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "current_research_landscape": "The core research cluster focuses on enabling multilingual, culturally aware language technologies that address digital linguistic injustice and support diverse languages, especially low-resourced and minoritized ones. Central themes include semantic processing of text, automatic dialogue systems, and speech generation within multilingual and digital humanities contexts. Methodologies revolve around computational models, interface building, language resource curation, and critical digital literacy frameworks. Digital language equality and multilingualism form a cultural and technical backdrop, with strong emphasis on language technologies' infrastructural and societal impact, as reflected in conference proceedings and strategic agendas.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite advances in multilingual NLP and digital language infrastructures, a significant internal gap concerns integrating linguistic typology knowledge explicitly into LLM training to better represent structural diversity across languages. The COVID-19 pandemic as a bridge node indicates intermittent disruptions in collaboration and dataset availability, limiting comprehensive language coverage. Additionally, critical digital literacies highlight a socio-technical gap — the mismatch between technology capabilities and user/community needs, especially for minoritized languages. External/Novel Gaps: Global second-order analyses reveal overlooked bridges linking 'processing of text' with digital literacy and health sciences, as well as distributed computing paradigms. Notably, the intersection of 'processing of text' and 'deadline' (timely resource allocation and model training) with distributed/fog-cloud infrastructures and deep reinforcement learning offers underexplored opportunities for scalable, adaptive LLM training with typological awareness. Moreover, links between linguistic processing and public health or education (digital and media literacy) hint at transdisciplinary potentials where linguistically informed NLP supports better societal outcomes, which is not yet leveraged locally.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Utilize advanced distributed computing and deep reinforcement learning methods (from 'processing of text' and 'deadline' hidden bridges) to design scalable LLM training frameworks that dynamically integrate typological features, overcoming low-resource language scarcity and infrastructural bottlenecks.\n\nOpportunity 2: Integrate frameworks from digital health literacy and educational pedagogies (emerging from 'processing of text' and 'critical digital literacies' bridge concepts) to co-develop linguistically typology-aware AI systems that improve accessible multilingual content generation and dialogue systems, fostering digital inclusion in vulnerable language communities.\n\nOpportunity 3: Leverage the COVID-19 pandemic as a socio-technical lens (bridge node) to model resilient collaborative language resource development pipelines that connect digital humanities and automatic dialogue system research, embedding ethical considerations from social translation impacts to enhance diverse LLM representations respecting cultural contexts."
