        "title": "Secure and Scalable Multimodal Federated Adaptation on Resource-Constrained Edge Devices with Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation for Biomedical AI",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing federated learning (FL) methods in biomedical AI predominantly handle unimodal data and overlook the challenges of adapting multilingual foundation models securely across heterogeneous and resource-constrained clinical edge devices that process diverse modalities such as clinical text, diagnostic images, and structured electronic health records (EHR). Privacy-preserving knowledge distillation across modalities and languages remains underexplored, particularly under strict encryption and resource constraints.",
        "Motivation": "Bridging this critical gap, our work focuses on a rigorous, scalable framework for federated multimodal and multilingual adaptation that explicitly addresses alignment and privacy in knowledge distillation under strict encryption, heterogeneous data distributions, and edge device computational limits. By integrating structured EHR data alongside unstructured clinical text and images, and tailoring Transformer-based language models for low-resource hospital edge nodes, we aim to push the frontier beyond existing unimodal or non-resource-aware approaches. This elevates the contribution from merely multimodal FL to a practically deployable, privacy-first, and widely applicable healthcare AI solution with enhanced linguistic and modality generalization.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a secured, modular federated distillation framework that aligns and fuses unimodal representations across modalities (clinical text, diagnostic images, EHR) and languages via a multi-stage approach: \n\n1. **Local Unimodal Model Training**: Each edge client trains modality-specific encoders incorporating lightweight Transformer-based backbones optimized for resource-constrained environments. Structured EHR features are encoded with tailored embedding modules capturing clinical semantics.\n\n2. **Encrypted Soft-Label Exchange with Homomorphic Encryption**: Clients generate soft-label outputs and project them into a privacy-respecting embedding space. These embeddings are encrypted using homomorphic encryption schemes to allow the central server to perform aggregation and cross-modal alignment without plaintext exposure, preserving data confidentiality.\n\n3. **Cross-Modal and Cross-Lingual Alignment Module**: The server employs a privacy-aware cross-modal distillation process using gated attention mechanisms that fuse encrypted modality embeddings with auxiliary language embeddings, ensuring secure and robust alignment.\n\n4. **Federated Multimodal Language Adaptation**: Language embeddings are learned jointly with modality representations, employing federated optimization that respects communication bandwidth constraints and computational limits, enabling effective multilingual adaptation.\n\n5. **Communication Optimization and Edge Deployment Strategies**: Employ model quantization, sparsification, and adjustable update frequencies to fit communication budgets and computational limits of clinical edge devices.\n\nThis methodological design is supported by a detailed schematic depicting secure embedding, encryption, and fusion pipelines to demonstrate feasibility and soundness in real-world biomedical federated environments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. **Dataset Curation and Simulation**: Assemble publicly available multimodal biomedical datasets such as MIMIC-CXR (chest X-rays with text reports), i2b2 clinical EHR records, and multilingual clinical note corpora (e.g., French and Spanish translations), harmonized to form multimodal triples per patient. Where datasets lack pairing or privacy constraints impede sharing, simulate realistic data distributions with synthetic EHR and imaging data using privacy-preserving generative models.\n\n2. **Preprocessing Pipelines**: Develop standardized modality-specific pipelines including tokenization for multiple languages, image normalization and augmentation, and clinical feature extraction from EHRs. Implement consistent modality alignment schemas.\n\n3. **Baseline Models**: Implement unimodal FL baselines and multimodal FL without encryption or with na√Øve distillation for comparative analysis.\n\n4. **Proposed Framework Implementation**: Deploy local modality encoders and encrypted soft-label generation on resource-constrained edge device simulators. Implement the encrypted federated aggregation server with cross-modal and cross-lingual alignment.\n\n5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Measure modality-specific and cross-modal accuracy for tasks like entity recognition (NER) in multilingual clinical text, diagnostic prediction from imaging and EHR fusion, and outcome prediction. Evaluate privacy preservation with formal privacy leakage metrics under encryption schemes. Assess linguistic adaptation quality via cross-lingual transfer gains and robustness. Measure communication cost, latency, and computational efficiency to validate edge feasibility.\n\n6. **Ablation Studies**: Test impacts of encryption parameters, embedding fusion strategies, and resource constraints on performance and privacy.\n\n7. **Statistical Validation**: Use cross-validation and significance testing to ensure robustness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: Input - Clinical note in French, X-ray image, and structured EHR entries from a hospital edge node. Output - Federated model predicts pneumonia diagnosis with improved accuracy through encrypted cross-modal distillation and multilingual adaptation.\n\nExample 2: Input - Spanish clinical text and associated cardiac ultrasound images plus EHR vitals on a resource-constrained edge device. Output - Federated model provides entity recognition and risk stratification with privacy guarantees and efficient communication.\n\nExample 3: Input - English clinical text and radiology image data at a hospital node with limited computing power; Output - Model update compressed and encrypted, enabling secure aggregation without leakage while maintaining performance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If homomorphic encryption overhead limits scalability, investigate hybrid secure aggregation methods combining differential privacy and cryptographic masking to balance privacy and efficiency. If cross-modal alignment under encryption proves ineffective, explore hierarchical federated learning where modalities are aligned at intermediate aggregation nodes before global fusion. If edge device constraints prove too stringent, consider offloading heavier computations to proximate fog nodes with secure channels. In all scenarios, modality-agnostic language adaptation fallback methods will be refined to maintain baseline multilingual federated learning utility."

However, the mechanism for securely aligning unimodal representations across heterogeneous modalities and languages is underspecified. Details on how knowledge distillation effectively preserves privacy while maintaining cross-modal and cross-lingual alignment, especially given the encrypted soft labels, are missing. Clarify how encryption affects the fidelity of distillation, and how modality and language embeddings are integrated without leakage or performance degradation. Providing a more explicit technical description or schematic of these interactions will strengthen soundness and the feasibility of implementation at scale in realistic federated environments, particularly in biomedical domains with strict privacy constraints and diverse modalities like clinical text and images. This is critical to dispel doubts about the core mechanism's viability and security trade-offs in this complex multimodal federated setting (Proposed_Method)."

However, the plan lacks concrete detail on dataset availability, preprocessing pipelines for heterogeneous modalities and languages, and the integration approach for auxiliary language embeddings. Given the difficulty of assembling multilingual, multimodal biomedical datasets, the plan should incorporate a clearer strategy for data sourcing, handling distributional heterogeneity, privacy-preserving data simulation (if real data is limited), and baseline comparisons. Also, metrics to evaluate privacy preservation, linguistic adaptation quality, and cross-modal distillation effectiveness must be explicitly listed. Without these refinements, it risks being impractical and under-evaluative. Strengthening the experimental rigor with publicly available biomedical multimodal datasets or well-justified synthetic alternatives will enhance feasibility and confidence in results (Experiment_Plan)."
