    "title": "Fog-Cloud Cooperative Framework for Typologically Diverse LLM Training",
    "Problem_Statement": "Scalable training frameworks for typology-enriched LLMs face infrastructural bottlenecks and lack integration with distributed computing paradigms to handle diverse language data at scale.",
    "Motivation": "Seizes the hidden bridge between 'processing of text' and 'distributed computing' paradigms from the gap analysis to build a novel fog-cloud hybrid architecture specialized in typology-aware LLM training, addressing infrastructural and deadline constraints (opportunity 1).",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a distributed training system where typology-specific submodules are processed in local fog nodes close to language data sources, enabling low-latency preprocessing and typology feature extraction. Cloud nodes handle global model aggregation and reinforcement learning-driven scheduling for resource allocation respecting deadlines. The system dynamically shifts workloads to optimize training efficiency and diversity representation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Prototype fog nodes with typology-aware feature extractors for a set of low-resource languages. 2. Integrate with cloud-based parameter server architecture. 3. Run timing, throughput, and model quality benchmarks comparing centralized vs fog-cloud setups. 4. Evaluate language representation improvement on downstream multilingual tasks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Text datasets in Navajo and Xhosa distributed across fog nodes in respective geographies; Expected Output: Efficient parallel processing and typology-sensitive model updates maintaining training deadlines.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If distributed scheduling is complex, begin with hybrid batch processing splitting based on language typology. Use simulation to ease deployment challenges."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a fog-cloud hybrid system with typology-specific submodules running on fog nodes and cloud nodes handling aggregation and RL-driven scheduling. However, the mechanism lacks clarity in key aspects: how typology-aware feature extractors are architected or integrated within the training pipeline, the specifics of communication protocols between fog and cloud nodes, and how reinforcement learning scheduling explicitly respects different language deadlines and resource constraints. A more detailed description of system components, their interactions, and the data/control flow would strengthen the soundness and credibility of the approach, making assumptions explicit rather than implied or high-level. Consider providing architectural diagrams and formal descriptions to improve clarity and rigor in this core section (Proposed_Method). This will also help reviewers and readers assess novelty and feasibility better, especially in a competitive area with existing similar distributed training frameworks said to be integrated with language diversity considerations.  \n\nFurthermore, it is unclear how the system addresses potential heterogeneity and instability of fog nodes and how these affect model convergence and deadline adherence. Addressing these issues would greatly improve the methodological robustness and credibility of the proposal's core mechanism."

While structured, the plan does not sufficiently consider obstacles related to distributed system deployment, such as network variability, fault tolerance, and real-world data heterogeneity across diverse language geographies.\n\nMoreover, the evaluation metrics focus on timing, throughput, and downstream representation improvement but do not explicitly include measures related to system stability, scheduling effectiveness under deadline constraints, or reinforcement learning scheduling efficiency. Also lacking is a plan for validating the complexity and scalability of the RL-based scheduler.\n\nIn addition, the benchmark comparisons need clarity: the 'centralized vs fog-cloud setups' baseline choice should be clearly motivated, and expected improvements should be quantified or hypothesized explicitly.\n\nTo increase feasibility and scientific soundness, the experiment plan should also incorporate simulated environments or staged rollout strategies considering real-world deployment challenges. Including ablation studies isolating the contributions of fog nodes and RL scheduling would clarify their respective impacts. Overall, refinement and enrichment of the experimental design are needed before practical implementation."
