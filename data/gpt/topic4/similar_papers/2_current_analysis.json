Foundation models such as ChatGPT, LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and multimodal patient interactions. The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges, and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs and FL, laying the groundwork for healthcare innovations.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Building an Ethical and Trustworthy Biomedical AI Ecosystem for the Translational and Clinical Integration of Foundation Models', 'abstract': 'Foundation Models (FMs) are gaining increasing attention in the biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem due to their ability to represent and contextualize multimodal biomedical data. These capabilities make FMs a valuable tool for a variety of tasks, including biomedical reasoning, hypothesis generation, and interpreting complex imaging data. In this review paper, we address the unique challenges associated with establishing an ethical and trustworthy biomedical AI ecosystem, with a particular focus on the development of FMs and their downstream applications. We explore strategies that can be implemented throughout the biomedical AI pipeline to effectively tackle these challenges, ensuring that these FMs are translated responsibly into clinical and translational settings. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of key stewardship and co-design principles that not only ensure robust regulation but also guarantee that the interests of all stakeholders-especially those involved in or affected by these clinical and translational applications-are adequately represented. We aim to empower the biomedical AI community to harness these models responsibly and effectively. As we navigate this exciting frontier, our collective commitment to ethical stewardship, co-design, and responsible translation will be instrumental in ensuring that the evolution of FMs truly enhances patient care and medical decision-making, ultimately leading to a more equitable and trustworthy biomedical AI ecosystem.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Compressed models for co-reference resolution: enhancing efficiency with debiased word embeddings', 'abstract': 'This work presents a comprehensive approach to reduce bias in word embedding vectors and evaluate the impact on various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Two GloVe variations (840B and 50) are debiased by identifying the gender direction in the word embedding space and then removing or reducing the gender component from the embeddings of target words, while preserving useful semantic information. Their gender bias is assessed through the Word Embedding Association Test. The performance of co-reference resolution and text classification models trained on both original and debiased embeddings is evaluated in terms of accuracy. A compressed co-reference resolution model is examined to gauge the effectiveness of debiasing techniques on resource-efficient models. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply compression techniques to debiased models. By analyzing the context preservation of debiased embeddings using a Twitter misinformation dataset, this study contributes valuable insights into the practical implications of debiasing methods for real-world applications such as person profiling.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Artificial Intelligence in Emergency Medicine: Viewpoint of Current Applications and Foreseeable Opportunities and Challenges', 'abstract': 'Emergency medicine and its services have reached a breaking point during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Second, we examine the ethics and risk specificities of the use of AI in the emergency field.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Case reports unlocked: Harnessing large language models to advance research on child maltreatment', 'abstract': \"BACKGROUND: Research on child protective services (CPS) is impeded by a lack of high-quality structured data. Crucial information on cases is often documented in case files, but only in narrative form. Researchers have applied automated language processing to extract structured data from these narratives, but this has been limited to classification tasks of fairly low complexity. Large language models (LLMs) may work for more challenging tasks.\\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to extract structured data from narrative casework reports by applying LLMs to distinguish between different subtypes of violence: child sexual abuse, child physical abuse, a child witnessing domestic violence, and a child being physically aggressive.\\nMETHODS: We developed a four-stage pipeline comprising of (1) text segmentation, (2) text segment classification, and subsequent labeling of (3) casework reports, and (4) cases. All CPS reports (N\\xa0=\\xa029,770) between 2008 and 2022 from Switzerland's largest CPS provider were collected. 28,223 text segments were extracted based on pre-defined keywords. Two human reviewers annotated random samples of text segments and reports for training and validation. Model performance was compared against human-coded test data.\\nRESULTS: The best-performing LLM (Mixtral-8x7B) classified text segments with an accuracy of 87\\xa0%, outperforming agreement between the two human reviewers (77\\xa0%). The model also correctly labelled casework reports with an accuracy of 87\\xa0%, but only when disregarding non-extracted text segments in stage (1).\\nCONCLUSIONS: LLMs can replicate human coding of text documents even for highly complex tasks that require contextual information. This may considerably advance research on CPS. Transparency can be achieved by backtracking labeling decisions to individual text segments. Keyword-based text segmentation was identified as a weak point, and the potential for bias that may occur at several stages of the process requires attention.\"}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Demystifying the Role of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Smart City Applications: Background, Motivation, Recent Advances, and Future Research Directions', 'abstract': 'Smart cities provide an efficient infrastructure for the enhancement of the quality of life of the people by aiding in fast urbanization and resource management through sustainable and scalable innovative solutions. The penetration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in smart cities has been a major contributor to keeping up with the agility and pace of their development. In this paper, we have explored Natural Language Processing (NLP) which is one such technical discipline that has great potential in optimizing ICT processes and has so far been kept away from the limelight. Through this study, we have established the various roles that NLP plays in building smart cities after thoroughly analyzing its architecture, background, and scope. Subsequently, we present a detailed description of NLP’s recent applications in the domain of smart healthcare, smart business, and industry, smart community, smart media, smart research, and development as well as smart education accompanied by NLP’s open challenges at the very end.

Despite the substantial health and economic ramifications, the potential unfairness of those automated tools was understudied and required more attention. In this work, we systematically evaluated the fairness level in a multimodal remote mental health dataset and an assessment system, where we compared the fairness level in race, gender, education level, and age. Demographic parity ratio (DPR) and equalized odds ratio (EOR) of classifiers using different modalities were compared, along with the F1 scores in different demographic groups. Post-training classifier threshold optimization was employed to mitigate the unfairness. No statistically significant unfairness was found in the composition of the dataset. Varying degrees of unfairness were identified among modalities, with no single modality consistently demonstrating better fairness across all demographic variables. Post-training mitigation effectively improved both DPR and EOR metrics at the expense of a decrease in F1 scores. Addressing and mitigating unfairness in these automated tools are essential steps in fostering trust among clinicians, gaining deeper insights into their use cases, and facilitating their appropriate utilization.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Offensive language detection in low resource languages: A use case of Persian language', 'abstract': 'THIS ARTICLE USES WORDS OR LANGUAGE THAT IS CONSIDERED PROFANE, VULGAR, OR OFFENSIVE BY SOME READERS. Different types of abusive content such as offensive language, hate speech, aggression, etc. have become prevalent in social media and many efforts have been dedicated to automatically detect this phenomenon in different resource-rich languages such as English. This is mainly due to the comparative lack of annotated data related to offensive language in low-resource languages, especially the ones spoken in Asian countries. To reduce the vulnerability among social media users from these regions, it is crucial to address the problem of offensive language in such low-resource languages. Hence, we present a new corpus of Persian offensive language consisting of 6,000 out of 520,000 randomly sampled micro-blog posts from X (Twitter) to deal with offensive language detection in Persian as a low-resource language in this area. We introduce a method for creating the corpus and annotating it according to the annotation practices of recent efforts for some benchmark datasets in other languages which results in categorizing offensive language and the target of offense as well. We perform extensive experiments with three classifiers in different levels of annotation with a number of classical Machine Learning (ML), Deep learning (DL), and transformer-based neural networks including monolingual and multilingual pre-trained language models. Furthermore, we propose an ensemble model integrating the aforementioned models to boost the performance of our offensive language detection task. Initial results on single models indicate that SVM trained on character or word n-grams are the best performing models accompanying monolingual transformer-based pre-trained language model ParsBERT in identifying offensive vs non-offensive content, targeted vs untargeted offense, and offensive towards individual or group. In addition, the stacking ensemble model outperforms the single models by a substantial margin, obtaining 5% respective macro F1-score improvement for three levels of annotation.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Benchmark suites instead of leaderboards for evaluating AI fairness', 'abstract': 'Benchmarks and leaderboards are commonly used to track the fairness impacts of artificial intelligence (AI)\\xa0models. Many critics argue against this practice, since it incentivizes optimizing for metrics in an attempt\\xa0to build the \"most fair\" AI model. However, this is an inherently impossible task since different applications have different considerations. While we agree with the critiques against leaderboards, we\\xa0believe that the use of\\xa0benchmarks can be reformed. Thus far, the critiques of leaderboards and benchmarks have become unhelpfully entangled. However, benchmarks, when not used for leaderboards, offer important tools for understanding a model. We advocate for collecting benchmarks into carefully curated \"benchmark suites,\" which can provide researchers and practitioners with tools for understanding the wide range of potential harms and trade-offs among different aspects of fairness. We describe the research needed to build these benchmark suites so that they can better assess different usage modalities, cover potential harms, and reflect diverse perspectives. By moving away from leaderboards and instead thoughtfully designing and compiling benchmark suites, we can better monitor and improve the fairness impacts of AI technology.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Explicitly unbiased large language models still form biased associations', 'abstract': \"Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit social bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases. Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: As LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make. We address both challenges by introducing two measures: LLM Word Association Test, a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Relative Decision Test, a strategy to detect subtle discrimination in contextual decisions. Both measures are based on psychological research: LLM Word Association Test adapts the Implicit Association Test, widely used to study the automatic associations between concepts held in human minds; and LLM Relative Decision Test operationalizes psychological results indicating that relative evaluations between two candidates, not absolute evaluations assessing each independently, are more diagnostic of implicit biases. Using these measures, we found pervasive stereotype biases mirroring those in society in 8 value-aligned models across 4 social categories (race, gender, religion, health) in 21 stereotypes (such as race and criminality, race and weapons, gender and science, age and negativity). These prompt-based measures draw from psychology's long history of research into measuring stereotypes based on purely observable behavior; they expose nuanced biases in proprietary value-aligned LLMs that appear unbiased according to standard benchmarks.\"}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem this research cluster addresses is how to effectively extract structured, fair, and unbiased data representations from complex, unstructured sources—such as narrative child protective services reports and clinical data—to enable trustworthy and equitable AI applications, especially in multilingual and multimodal large language models (LLMs). The core focus centers around refining text segmentation and extraction methods, integrating human review and co-design principles within ethical AI ecosystems, and leveraging foundation models to transform healthcare and social services. Dominant methodologies include deploying state-of-the-art foundation language models and embeddings (including debiased embeddings), combined with human-in-the-loop annotation and evaluation strategies. Ethical stewardship and systematic fairness evaluation, including demographic parity and bias assessment techniques adapted from psychological research, are emphasized. The thematic islands reveal concentrated efforts in (1) NLP-driven structured data extraction from sensitive narratives with human oversight, (2) co-design and ethical integration of AI pipelines in biomedical and social settings handling complex image and multimodal data, and (3) practical AI applications aiming to transform healthcare through trustworthy, multimodal intelligence systems.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps include the inadequacy of current keyword-based and text segmentation approaches—particularly their brittleness and bias propagation risks during the early stages of structured data extraction. Despite advances in debiasing embeddings and fairness metrics, implicit biases remain pervasive in value-aligned LLMs, which standard benchmarks often fail to detect. There is also a lack of scalable frameworks that unify the bias mitigation in multilingual and multimodal settings with transparent human-AI co-design oversight to ensure ethical governance. The bridge nodes highlight that while text segmentation and data extraction are pivotal, their integration with complex downstream AI pipelines and fairness-oriented AI ecosystems is underdeveloped, limiting holistic bias mitigation throughout AI workflows.\n\nExternally, the global context reveals overlooked opportunities in cross-disciplinary techniques connecting text segmentation with complex image data processing, AI-based applications, and advanced computer vision methods. For instance, multimodal fusion techniques from medical image segmentation and multi-scale self-attention mechanisms could augment text segmentation robustness and contextual understanding in narrative data. The hidden bridges suggest leveraging state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models and generative adversarial networks used in AI-based applications to improve segmentation quality and fairness evaluation in multilingual LLM contexts. These cross-disciplinary techniques remain untapped for mitigating biases emerging from heterogeneous data modalities and linguistic nuances in multilingual settings.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate advanced multimodal semantic segmentation and multi-level fusion techniques from biomedical image analysis (Global Bridge C) with text segmentation methods in child protective services narrative extraction (Local Thematic Island B2). This would enhance robustness in data segmentation, enabling more accurate and unbiased structured data inputs for downstream fairness-aware NLP models.\n\nOpportunity 2: Develop benchmark suites that move beyond leaderboards (as critiqued in paper 9) by combining psychological-inspired implicit bias detection methods (e.g., LLM Word Association Tests) with fairness evaluation metrics used in multimodal remote mental health assessments. This aligns with co-design principles in the AI pipeline to create transparent, cross-validated fairness evaluation frameworks for multilingual LLMs deployed in sensitive real-world domains.\n\nOpportunity 3: Leverage generative adversarial networks and deep neural network architectures from AI-based applications (Global Context) to generate augmented, balanced multilingual corpora that address resource sparsity and bias propagation in low-resource languages and dialects, thus mitigating unfairness in offensive language detection and contextual labeling tasks. This synergistically addresses internal gaps around dataset diversity and biased representations found in current LLM training and evaluation."
