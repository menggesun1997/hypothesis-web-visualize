    "abstract": "This survey explores the transformative impact of foundation models (FMs) in artificial intelligence, focusing on their integration with federated learning (FL) in biomedical research. Foundation models such as ChatGPT, LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and multimodal patient interactions. The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges, and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs and FL, laying the groundwork for healthcare innovations.",

    "abstract": "Machine Translation (MT) for low-resource languages, such as Twi, remains a persistent challenge in natural language processing (NLP) due to the scarcity of extensive parallel datasets. Due to their heavy reliance on high-resource data, traditional methods frequently fall short, underserving low-resource languages. To address this, we propose a fine-tuned T5 model trained using a Cross-Lingual Optimization Framework (CLOF), a unique method that dynamically modifies gradient weights to balance low-resource (Twi) and high-resource (English) datasets. This cross-lingual learning framework leverages the strengths of federated training to improve translation performance while ensuring scalability for other low-resource languages. In order to maximize model input, the study makes use of a carefully selected parallel English-Twi corpus that has been aligned and tokenized. A thorough evaluation of translation quality is provided by the use of SPBLEU, ROUGE (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L) measures, and Word Error Rate (WER) metrics. A pretrained mT5 model is used to set baseline performance, which acts as a standard for the optimized model. The suggested method shows notable benefits, according to experimental results. The fine-tuned model achieves a remarkable increase in SPBLEU from 2.16% to 71.30%, a rise in ROUGE-1 from 15.23% to 65.24%, and a notable reduction in WER from 183.16% to 68.32%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of CLOF in addressing the challenges of low-resource MT and enhancing the quality of Twi translations. This work demonstrates the potential of combining cross-lingual learning and federated training to advance NLP for underrepresented languages, paving the way for more inclusive and scalable translation systems.",
