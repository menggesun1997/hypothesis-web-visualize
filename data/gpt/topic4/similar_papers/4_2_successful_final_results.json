        "title": "Systematic Privacy-Driven Continual Federated Learning with Language-Specific Regularization for Multilingual Biomedical NLP",
        "Problem_Statement": "Continual federated learning (FL) for personalized biomedical NLP across languages with scarce data faces significant challenges: catastrophic forgetting during continual model updates, heterogeneous and non-i.i.d. client distributions, linguistic diversity, and privacy risks from sensitive clinical data. Existing FL methods lack systematic mechanisms that jointly handle privacy preservation, continual adaptation, and language-specific personalization while rigorously quantifying privacy-utility trade-offs and mitigating forgetting, especially in low-resource biomedical language settings.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work explores continual FL and privacy separately, there is a compelling need for a principled approach that integrates language-specific regularization with differential privacy in a unified framework. Emphasizing rigorous mechanism design and evaluation in multilingual biomedical domains—particularly for low-resource languages like Thai—addresses critical gaps identified in federated continual learning, privacy, and multilingual adaptation fields. Our approach is designed to surpass competitive baselines with sophisticated continual learning algorithms by formalizing trade-offs and explicitly tackling client heterogeneity and non-i.i.d. issues through adaptive regularization, leading to improved personalization and robustness in privacy-sensitive healthcare NLP applications.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a federated continual learning system that jointly employs a mathematically formulated language-specific regularization and differential privacy-based noise injection adapted per client. \n\n1. **Mechanism Design:** Language-specific regularization terms are defined as penalties on deviations of the client model parameters from a language-adaptive reference embedding subspace derived from multilingual pretrained language models fine-tuned on biomedical corpora. This regularizer constrains updates to preserve critical linguistic features and prevent catastrophic forgetting during continual updates.\n\n2. **Differential Privacy Integration:** We incorporate client-wise differential privacy by adding calibrated Gaussian noise to local model gradients during each federated epoch, carefully integrating privacy accounting over continual rounds using Rényi Differential Privacy. The noise injection parameters adapt dynamically depending on the observed client data heterogeneity and privacy budget.\n\n3. **Client Heterogeneity Handling:** To address non-i.i.d. and personalized distributions, the regularization strength is modulated per client based on a similarity metric computed from historical representations, enhancing personalized forgetting prevention and knowledge transfer while respecting data distribution shifts.\n\n4. **Algorithmic Sketch:**\n   - At each round, clients perform local continual updates with language-specific regularization added as an extra loss term.\n   - Local gradients are clipped and Gaussian noise added to guarantee differential privacy.\n   - Clients synchronize updated models with the server via weighted aggregation considering client similarity.\n   - Privacy budgets and model drift are tracked continuously.\n\n5. **Integration of Few-Shot and Context Window Techniques:** To accommodate severely low-resource scenarios and leverage contextual biomedical information, the method incorporates few-shot adaptation via prompt-based fine-tuning on local data, enhanced with adaptive context window mechanisms from pretrained language models to maximize information extraction while remaining privacy-compliant.\n\nThe overall approach innovatively integrates continual learning, privacy-preserving mechanisms, multilingual linguistic constraints, and few-shot contextual adaptations into an end-to-end federated learning framework explicitly targeting realistic, heterogeneous biomedical NLP settings.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. **Datasets:** Utilize publicly accessible biomedical datasets such as MIMIC-III for English, and extend to multilingual biomedical corpora including WikiAnn and MedMentions in Thai and other low-resource languages. Where data scarcity exists, simulate client distributions by partitioning and temporal slicing to reflect real clinical note arrivals.\n\n2. **Time-sequenced Simulation:** Create a chronological data stream per client simulating non-i.i.d and distribution shifts by manipulating disease prevalence, note types, and language usage over time.\n\n3. **Baselines:** Compare against (i) centralized continual learning without privacy; (ii) standard federated learning (FedAvg); (iii) federated continual learning without language regularization; (iv) federated continual learning with privacy but no adaptive regularization; (v) recent state-of-the-art continual FL methods incorporating replay buffers or proximal terms.\n\n4. **Privacy Budget Management:** Implement rigorous privacy tracking over continual rounds using the Rényi Differential Privacy accountant, systematically testing privacy budgets (ε) and their impact on utility.\n\n5. **Metrics:** Evaluate performance via continual NER and biomedical text classification accuracy over time, quantify forgetting using backward transfer metrics, measure model stability by variance in performance across rounds, and report formal privacy guarantees.\n\n6. **Ablation Studies:** Test sensitivity to regularization strength, noise scale, and client heterogeneity parameters.\n\n7. **Reproducibility:** Release code, data partitions, and privacy accounting scripts with clear documentation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sequential arrival of new clinical notes in Thai and English with fluctuating disease mentions and note styles.\nOutput: Client models continually updated improve named entity recognition and disease classification accuracy without leakage of prior sensitive data. Models preserve language-specific biomedical terminology and avoid catastrophic forgetting observed in baseline methods. Privacy budgets are maintained within predefined limits across continual rounds, demonstrating the method’s effective trade-off between privacy and utility.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the imposed privacy noise excessively impairs model utility, we will explore adaptive clipping and noise scaling strategies dynamically tuned per client and per round, leveraging feedback from privacy-utility trade-off metrics. Further, we will incorporate lightweight local replay buffers with synthetic data generated by differentially private generative models to reinforce forgetting prevention without compromising privacy. Should language-specific regularization prove unstable under severe heterogeneity, alternative modular regularization strategies such as meta-learned adapters or parameter-efficient tuning via prompt-based few-shot learning will be considered to enhance personalization more robustly."

Clarify how language-specific regularization is formulated and imposed during continual updates, especially under differential privacy noise perturbations, and how this mechanism effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting while preserving linguistic features. Providing a clear mathematical formulation or algorithmic sketch would strengthen the soundness of the core mechanism and help anticipate potential trade-offs between personalization, privacy, and forgetting prevention. This is critical given the complex interplay of continual learning, privacy, and multilingual adaptation in the biomedical domain, and to convince readers of feasibility and novelty beyond existing federated learning approaches. Consider specifying how client heterogeneity and non-i.i.d. data distributions are handled by the regularization and privacy components as well, since these are common real-world challenges impacting method effectiveness and evaluation relevance in federated biomedical NLP scenarios."
