    "title": "Typology-Aware Curriculum Learning for Low-Resource Language Modeling",
    "Problem_Statement": "Standard LLM training pipelines do not prioritize or adapt dynamically to the typological characteristics of low-resource languages, limiting effective model learning and cross-lingual transfer.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap by designing typology-aware adaptive curriculum learning enabling targeted training schedules that reflect language-specific structural properties and data scarcity, integrating insights from opportunity 1 regarding reinforcement learning and distributed infrastructures.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement a scheduler that sequences training batches based on a language typological complexity score, progressively introducing languages from simpler to more complex typological profiles. Utilize a multitask LLM architecture with a specialized typology embedding module that conditions batch sampling. Training is distributed adaptively with deadlines optimized for computational load balancing.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Define typological complexity metrics from linguistic data. 2. Prepare multilingual corpora sorted by typological complexity. 3. Train LLMs with and without curriculum scheduler. 4. Benchmark on typology-sensitive tasks, including morphological prediction and syntactic parsing on low-resource languages. 5. Measure convergence speed, accuracy, and representation fairness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Morphologically rich language like Inuktitut. Expected Output: Improved morphological generation and understanding compared to baseline LLMs trained without typological curriculum.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If curriculum scheduling slows convergence, experiment with partial curriculum schemes or metadata-augmented multitask learning without strict ordering."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a scheduler sequencing training batches by typological complexity and mentions a multitask LLM with a typology embedding module, but the mechanism lacks clarity regarding how typological complexity scores are computed and integrated into training dynamics. It would strengthen the proposal to explicitly describe the typological complexity metrics, how they quantitatively influence batch sampling and model conditioning, and how the adaptive distributed training schedules are optimized in practice. Clarifying these mechanistic details is critical for reproducibility and convincing demonstration of soundness in adapting curriculum to typology-specific signals. Consider adding algorithmic pseudocode or diagrams to elucidate the scheduling and embedding integration processes more concretely within the multitask architecture context, thereby improving theoretical and implementation clarity, as well as hypothesis grounding in linguistic typology literature variants and reinforcement learning principles referenced in the Motivation section. This will directly improve soundness and reviewer confidence in the link between linguistic theory and model training methodology integration, currently only high-level described but not detailed mathematically or procedurally in the proposal's current form (Proposed_Method section)."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Experiment_Plan is generally well-structured but may face feasibility challenges both in defining suitable typological complexity metrics and in reliably benchmarking improvements across low-resource languages given data scarcity and variability. Step 1 lacks details regarding data sources and validation for selecting or synthesizing typological complexity scores; establishing standardized, interpretable, and linguistically motivated metrics here is nontrivial and essential for downstream curriculum quality. Additionally, Step 4's benchmarking relies heavily on typology-sensitive tasks like morphological prediction and syntactic parsing; however, these benchmarks may be under-resourced or absent for truly low-resource languages mentioned such as Inuktitut, potentially requiring additional corpus creation or augmentation that is not accounted for in the plan. To improve feasibility, supplement the plan with more concrete strategies for (a) curating, validating, and standardizing typological complexity metrics, including linguistic expert involvement or crowdsourcing approaches, and (b) ensuring availability or construction of reliable typology-sensitive benchmarks or proxy tasks for evaluation, possibly leveraging zero-shot or few-shot settings. Detailing fallback evaluation plans and resource needs, as well as clear computational load and timeline estimates for distributed training experiments, would further enhance scientific and practical rigor of the experiment plan."
