        "title": "Cross-Modal Semantic Fusion for Bias-Aware Multilingual Text Segmentation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current text segmentation methods for extracting structured data from unstructured narratives suffer from brittleness and propagate biases early, especially in multilingual scenarios. These methods rarely integrate complementary information from associated image data, limiting robustness and fairness in downstream tasks.",
        "Motivation": "This idea directly addresses the internal gaps in text segmentation robustness and bias propagation by leveraging the external opportunity of integrating multimodal fusion methods from biomedical image analysis. By applying multi-level semantic fusion, it fills the gap of underdeveloped integration of text segmentation with downstream pipelines and fairness ecosystems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel multimodal semantic fusion architecture that combines hierarchical biomedical image semantic segmentation models with advanced multilingual text segmentation. The approach extracts aligned semantic features from associated images (e.g., clinical scans) and text narratives, fusing multi-scale attention representations to enhance linguistic segmentation accuracy and reduce bias propagation. The fusion explicitly models cross-modal contextual dependencies and uses adversarial domain adaptation to balance linguistic bias across languages.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect bilingual/multilingual datasets with aligned narrative text and clinical/multimodal image data. 2) Implement baseline models: standalone text segmenters and biomedical image semantic segmenters. 3) Develop the fused architecture integrating multi-level semantic features. 4) Evaluate segmentation robustness and bias metrics (e.g., demographic parity, disparity impact) in multilingual contexts. 5) Compare downstream NLP model fairness using structured data from fused segmentation vs. text-only segmentation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A child protective services report narrative in Spanish accompanied by ultrasound images. Expected Output: Segmented text fields (e.g., incident description, demographic info) with improved segmentation accuracy and balanced representation across demographic groups compared to text-only segmentation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal fusion fails to improve performance, fallback to enhanced text-only segmentation using contextualized language models with multi-task fairness regularization and incorporate human-in-the-loop feedback for critical segments."

        "title": "Multilingual Adversarial Corpus Augmentation for Fair Offensive Language Detection",
        "Problem_Statement": "Offensive language detection models in low-resource languages and dialects suffer from bias due to resource sparsity and skewed data distributions, propagating unfairness in sensitive NLP applications.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the internal gap of dataset diversity and bias propagation, this idea leverages generative adversarial networks from AI-based applications to produce balanced multilingual corpora, mitigating bias and improving fairness as highlighted in opportunity 3 of the innovation landscape.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We design a multimodal deep adversarial augmentation framework that generates synthetic offensive and non-offensive textual examples across multiple low-resource languages. The GAN utilizes a dual generator-discriminator scheme informed by linguistic fairness constraints and dialectal features. The augmented datasets are then used to train fairer offensive language classifiers with bias regularization in multilingual LLMs.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect existing offensive language corpora in high-resource and low-resource languages. 2) Train baseline offensive language detection models. 3) Develop the multilingual GAN augmentation pipeline incorporating dialect and bias constraints. 4) Generate synthetic balanced data and retrain classifiers. 5) Evaluate detection accuracy, demographic parity, and false positive/negative fairness metrics across language groups.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Low-resource Yoruba offensive language dataset augmented with GAN-generated samples. Output: Improved detection F1 scores and reduced bias disparity metrics between dialectal groups.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If GAN-generated data quality is insufficient, fallback to data augmentation via back-translation and controlled paraphrasing to increase diversity while monitoring bias metrics."

        "title": "Transparent Human-AI Co-Designed Fairness Evaluation for Multilingual LLM Pipelines",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current bias evaluation frameworks for multilingual LLMs lack transparency, scalability, and human oversight, failing to integrate psychological implicit bias tests with fairness metrics in a coherent pipeline.",
        "Motivation": "This proposal targets internal gaps around scalable, transparent frameworks for bias mitigation with human-in-the-loop co-design, aligning with Opportunity 2 by synthesizing psychological implicit bias detection and multimodal fairness evaluation for sensitive multilingual applications.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular fairness evaluation platform that combines LLM word association implicit bias tests with fairness metrics adapted from multimodal mental health analyses. The platform incorporates interactive visualizations and human expert feedback loops to iteratively refine bias detection and mitigation. Co-designed workflows enable ethicists and domain experts to steer evaluation priorities according to cultural and linguistic contexts.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multilingual LLMs and relevant datasets in sensitive domains. 2) Implement psychological-inspired implicit bias tests and multimodal fairness metrics as modular components. 3) Integrate human-in-the-loop interfaces for feedback and transparency. 4) Conduct user studies with ethicists and AI developers. 5) Measure improvements in bias detection sensitivity and stakeholder trust metrics.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM embeddings tested for association biases with ethnic or gendered terms across languages. Output: Transparent bias scores with human annotations indicating false positives or cultural nuances.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If human co-design is resource-intensive, fallback to semi-automated bias report generation with extensive documentation and guidelines for ethical oversight."

        "title": "Multi-Scale Attention Models for Bias-Resilient Narrative Segmentation in Low-Resource Languages",
        "Problem_Statement": "Keyword-based and traditional text segmentation methods perform poorly and propagate bias in multilingual low-resource settings, particularly with narrative data rich in cultural and linguistic nuances.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the brittleness and bias propagation in early structured data extraction stages (internal gap) by adapting multi-scale self-attention mechanisms from advanced computer vision and biomedical image segmentation (external bridge), enhancing contextual understanding in multilingual narrative segmentation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We develop a novel hierarchical multi-scale attention LLM architecture that segments narratives at multiple granularities, leveraging cross-lingual transfer learning and context-aware representation to minimize bias propagation. This architecture integrates positional embeddings with modality-inspired attention patterns to capture linguistic and cultural subtleties across languages.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble multilingual narrative datasets from child protective services and similar sensitive domains. 2) Implement baseline segmentation models using keyword and conventional methods. 3) Develop and train multi-scale attention segmentation models with transfer learning. 4) Evaluate segmentation quality, bias metrics, and downstream fairness in structured data extraction.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Narrative text describing social service case in low-resource language (e.g., Amharic). Output: Accurate segmented fields reflecting unbiased representation versus keyword baseline.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-scale attention doesn't sufficiently improve segmentation, fallback to ensemble models combining rule-based and neural approaches with human review integration."

        "title": "Unified Framework for Multimodal Bias Mitigation with Explainable Human-AI Oversight",
        "Problem_Statement": "There is no scalable, unified framework that integrates bias mitigation across multilingual and multimodal data with transparent human-AI co-design for ethical governance throughout the AI pipeline.",
        "Motivation": "Directly addressing the critical internal gap of lacking unified and transparent bias mitigation systems, this idea innovates by combining multimodal analysis, explainability techniques, and human oversight into a single ethical AI ecosystem.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an end-to-end bias mitigation framework that jointly processes text, images, and structured data using multimodal transformers enhanced with explainability modules (e.g., attention visualization, counterfactual explanations). The system incorporates human-in-the-loop checkpoints where experts can intervene, provide feedback, and adjust fairness objectives dynamically. Transparent dashboards track bias metrics and decision rationale across pipeline stages.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multimodal multilingual datasets in biomedical and social service domains. 2) Build baseline pipelines without integrated oversight. 3) Develop the unified framework incorporating explainability and human feedback loops. 4) Conduct user studies to evaluate transparency and effectiveness in bias reduction. 5) Compare fairness metrics pre- and post-framework deployment.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multilingual clinical note with accompanying images processed through the framework. Output: Structured data extraction with bias mitigated, accompanied by visual explainability artifacts and expert annotations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If human-AI interaction slows throughput, fallback to automated explainability with periodic human audits, focusing expert time on highest-risk cases."
