    "title": "Typology-Guided Federated Gradient Balancing for Cross-Lingual Optimization",
    "Problem_Statement": "Gradient updates aggregated uniformly across diverse languages in federated training tend to cause negative interference, especially when languages differ typologically, hampering model generalization beyond single-language setups.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses gradient balancing bottlenecks by incorporating sociolinguistic typology and language similarity metrics to dynamically weight updates during federated aggregation (Opportunity 3). This novel approach synthesizes linguistic theory with federated optimization, a bridge currently missing in federated multilingual NLP.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a federated aggregation algorithm that assigns language-specific weights to client gradients based on learned embeddings of typological features (e.g., syntactic order, morphology) and statistical similarity (e.g., lexical overlap). Weights modulate contribution during model update steps to reduce cross-lingual gradient conflicts. The system learns these weighting functions online, adapting to new languages and dialects with minimal labeled data, extending beyond single-language case studies.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compile typological feature vectors for participating languages from linguistic databases. 2) Simulate federated training over a mixture of product languages, measuring performance with uniform vs. typology-weighted aggregation. 3) Evaluate language-wise metrics (BLEU, perplexity) and cross-lingual transfer gains. 4) Perform ablation on weighting mechanisms and test on newly introduced underrepresented languages. 5) Analyze gradient variance reduction and convergence behavior.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Federated translation training for Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo with typological annotations. Output: Improved aggregate model with balanced performance across these languages, reduced negative transfer seen in uniformly aggregated baselines.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If typological weighting yields unstable training, incorporate clustering-based gradient grouping or meta-learning techniques for weighting. Alternatively, combine with gradient surgery approaches to mitigate negative transfer."

        "title": "Agent-Guided Federated Gradient Balancing with Typological and Contextual Adaptation for Cross-Lingual Optimization",
        "Problem_Statement": "Federated training aggregating gradient updates uniformly across typologically diverse languages often causes negative interference and performance degradation, impeding robust multilingual model generalization and transfer especially in low-resource and underrepresented languages.",
        "Motivation": "Current federated multilingual optimization approaches overlook the dynamic, agent-level characteristics of client languages and their operational contexts, leading to suboptimal gradient aggregation that mainly relies on static linguistic typology. By reconceptualizing each client language node as an agent with distinct objectives, resource constraints, and evolving data distributions, we can leverage multi-agent coordination principles to dynamically balance gradient contributions. This fusion of linguistic theory, multi-agent systems, and information system security offers a novel, adaptive framework addressing gradient conflicts and bias toward dominant languages. Our approach advances federated multilingual NLP by integrating context-aware, distributed optimization that responds to heterogeneous language characteristics and security needs, marking a substantive step beyond prior static weighting methods.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an Agent-Guided Federated Gradient Balancing (AG-FGB) framework where each client language is modeled as a learning agent with its own local objective, performance feedback, and resource profile. The core gradient weighting function is formalized as \\( w_i = \\sigma(f_{typ}(T_i), f_{stat}(S_i), f_{perf}(P_i), f_{ctx}(C_i)) \\), where:  - \\(T_i\\): typological embedding vectors encoding syntactic order, morphology, etc.  - \\(S_i\\): statistical similarity measures (e.g., lexical overlap).  - \\(P_i\\): online performance metrics (e.g., local BLEU, loss convergence).  - \\(C_i\\): contextual factors like client resource constraints and network conditions. The function \\(f\\) is implemented as a trainable neural network jointly optimized across rounds with the global model. This enables adaptive weighting that balances typological knowledge with dynamic agent feedback, mitigating bias toward dominant clients. Additionally, agent negotiation protocols inspired by multi-agent reinforcement learning enable clients to propose and adjust their gradient weights iteratively before aggregation, fostering consensus and conflict reduction. Privacy-preserving mechanisms including differential privacy and secure aggregation protocols drawn from modern information systems are integrated to safeguard sensitive data during weight updates and negotiation. We provide algorithmic pseudocode detailing the joint training of weighting functions, agent feedback integration, and secure coordination steps. The weighting adapts online to new languages and dialects, guided by minimal labeled data and unsupervised domain adaptation techniques, ensuring robustness and generalizability in dynamic federated environments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct typological embeddings from linguistic databases and extract statistical similarity metrics for participating languages. 2) Define client agents modeling resource profiles and local objectives; implement performance and contextual feedback mechanisms. 3) Develop and implement the weighting function \\(w_i\\) as a differentiable neural model integrated with the federated optimizer. 4) Incorporate multi-agent reinforcement learning inspired negotiation protocols for dynamic gradient weight adjustment before aggregation. 5) Integrate privacy-preserving protocols including secure aggregation and differential privacy; validate system security under simulated attacks. 6) Conduct federated training simulations over multilingual datasets with both dominant and underrepresented languages (e.g., Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, plus emerging dialects). 7) Measure language-wise metrics (BLEU, perplexity), gradient conflict reduction, convergence stability, and bias mitigation relative to uniform and static typology-based baseline methods. 8) Perform extensive ablations to assess individual contributions of typological, statistical, performance, and contextual components. 9) Test framework robustness to dynamic client membership and labeled data scarcity via incremental experiments.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "In federated translation training of Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo, each language node acts as an agent with local objectives and resources. AG-FGB dynamically adjusts gradient weights by combining typological embeddings with real-time performance feedback and resource context. For example, the system down-weights noisy or resource-constrained clients adaptively, preventing dominant language bias. The output is an aggregate multilingual model demonstrating balanced performance improvements — higher BLEU scores for underrepresented languages without sacrificing dominant language quality — and smoother convergence relative to static weighting or uniform aggregation. During the addition of a new dialect with limited labels, the weighting function quickly adapts via unsupervised domain signals, enabling seamless integration without degrading overall model performance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should training instability arise from complex agent coordination, we will simplify by restricting weighting adaptation to a subset of features (e.g., fixing typology embeddings) and employing heuristic consensus protocols. If privacy integration limits performance, we will explore alternative secure aggregation methods balancing privacy and efficiency. In case negotiating weights prove too costly, clustering clients based on learned embeddings with meta-learning for weighting adjustments will be explored, alongside gradient surgery to explicitly remove conflicting gradient components to mitigate negative transfer."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposal to weight gradients based on typological embeddings and language similarity is conceptually appealing, the precise mechanism by which these weights are learned online remains unclear. The proposal should more concretely specify the form of the weighting function, how typological and statistical features are combined, and how the system prevents bias toward dominant languages during training. Clarifying these aspects is critical to assessing the soundness and reproducibility of the method and ensuring that the weighting method meaningfully reduces gradient conflicts without introducing new instability or bias in federated updates. Providing preliminary formulations or algorithmic pseudocode would strengthen this section significantly, enabling clearer evaluation of the method’s viability and theoretical soundness. Examples of how the weighting adapts as new languages or dialects are introduced are also needed to understand the method’s generalizability and robustness in dynamic federated setups without sufficient labeled data for all clients. Incorporating such details will greatly improve comprehension and allow more thorough peer review and replication attempts at conference submission time. The current presentation leaves the core proposed mechanism somewhat under-specified and thus insufficiently sound as stated."

          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty is assessed as NOV-COMPETITIVE, the idea could substantially enhance its impact and differentiation by explicitly integrating concepts from 'multi-agent systems' and 'information systems' fields. For instance, framing each client language node as an agent with its own objectives and constraints could enable leveraging multi-agent reinforcement learning or negotiation protocols to dynamically adjust gradient weights beyond static typological features. This agent-centric view could facilitate more adaptive and context-aware gradient balancing strategies that respond to client-specific performance and resource constraints, rather than relying solely on linguistic typology. Moreover, incorporating principles from modern information systems on distributed data security and privacy could strengthen the federated learning framework's resilience and practical deployment. By bridging linguistic typological theory with multi-agent coordination and robust information system architectures, the proposal could break new ground at the intersection of federated multilingual NLP and broader multidisciplinary AI domains, thereby improving chances of strong acceptance and long-term impact in premier venues."
