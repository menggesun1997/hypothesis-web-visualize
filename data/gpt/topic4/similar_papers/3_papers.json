    "abstract": "This survey explores the transformative impact of foundation models (FMs) in artificial intelligence, focusing on their integration with federated learning (FL) in biomedical research. Foundation models such as ChatGPT, LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and multimodal patient interactions. The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges, and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs and FL, laying the groundwork for healthcare innovations.",

    "abstract": "Critical National Infrastructures (CNIs)-including energy grids, water systems, transportation networks, and communication frameworks-are essential to modern society yet face escalating cybersecurity threats. This review paper comprehensively analyzes AI-driven approaches for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP). We begin by examining the reliability of CNIs and introduce established benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) within cybersecurity contexts. Next, we explore core cybersecurity issues, focusing on trust, privacy, resilience, and securability in these vital systems. Building on this foundation, we assess the role of Generative AI and LLMs in enhancing CIP and present insights on applying Agentic AI for proactive defense mechanisms. Finally, we outline future directions to guide the integration of advanced AI methodologies into protecting critical infrastructures. Our paper provides a strategic roadmap for researchers and practitioners committed to fortifying national infrastructures against emerging cyber threats through this synthesis of current challenges, benchmarking strategies, and innovative AI applications.",

    "year": 2025,

    "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has been a key enabler of technological innovation in healthcare. People can conveniently obtain a more accurate medical consultation service by utilizing LLMs' powerful knowledge inference capability. However, existing LLMs require users to upload explicit requests during remote healthcare consultations, which involves the risk of exposing personal privacy. Furthermore, the reliability of the response content generated by LLMs is not guaranteed. To tackle the above challenges, this paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving LLM for user-activated health, called Adaptive Compressed-based Privacy-preserving LLM (ACP2LLM). Specifically, an adaptive token compression method based on information entropy is carefully designed to ensure that ACP2LLM can preserve user-sensitive information when invoking the medical consultation of LLMs deployed on the cloud platform. Moreover, a multi-doctor one-chief physician mechanism is proposed to rationally split and collaboratively infer the patients' requests to achieve the privacy-utility trade-off. Notably, the proposed ACP2LLM also provides highly competitive performance in various token compression rates. Extensive experiments on multiple Medical Question and Answers datasets demonstrate that the proposed ACP2LLM has strong privacy protection capabilities and high answer precision, outperforming current state-of-the-art LLM methods.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) continue to exhibit noteworthy capabilities across a spectrum of areas, including emerging proficiencies across the health care continuum. Successful LLM implementation and adoption depend on digital readiness, modern infrastructure, a trained workforce, privacy, and an ethical regulatory landscape. These factors can vary significantly across health care ecosystems, dictating the choice of a particular LLM implementation pathway. This perspective discusses 3 LLM implementation pathways-training from scratch pathway (TSP), fine-tuned pathway (FTP), and out-of-the-box pathway (OBP)-as potential onboarding points for health systems while facilitating equitable adoption. The choice of a particular pathway is governed by needs as well as affordability. Therefore, the risks, benefits, and economics of these pathways across 4 major cloud service providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle) are presented. While cost comparisons, such as on-demand and spot pricing across the cloud service providers for the 3 pathways, are presented for completeness, the usefulness of managed services and cloud enterprise tools is elucidated. Managed services can complement the traditional workforce and expertise, while enterprise tools, such as federated learning, can overcome sample size challenges when implementing LLMs using health care data. Of the 3 pathways, TSP is expected to be the most resource-intensive regarding infrastructure and workforce while providing maximum customization, enhanced transparency, and performance. Because TSP trains the LLM using enterprise health care data, it is expected to harness the digital signatures of the population served by the health care system with the potential to impact outcomes. The use of pretrained models in FTP is a limitation. It may impact its performance because the training data used in the pretrained model may have hidden bias and may not necessarily be health care-related. However, FTP provides a balance between customization, cost, and performance. While OBP can be rapidly deployed, it provides minimal customization and transparency without guaranteeing long-term availability. OBP may also present challenges in interfacing seamlessly with downstream applications in health care settings with variations in pricing and use over time. Lack of customization in OBP can significantly limit its ability to impact outcomes. Finally, potential applications of LLMs in health care, including conversational artificial intelligence, chatbots, summarization, and machine translation, are highlighted. While the 3 implementation pathways discussed in this perspective have the potential to facilitate equitable adoption and democratization of LLMs, transitions between them may be necessary as the needs of health systems evolve. Understanding the economics and trade-offs of these onboarding pathways can guide their strategic adoption and demonstrate value while impacting health care outcomes favorably.",

    "title": "Paraphrase detection for Urdu language text using fine-tune BiLSTM framework",
    "year": 2025,
    "citationCount": 1,
    "fieldCitationRatio": NaN,
    "abstract": "Automated paraphrase detection is crucial for natural language processing (NL) applications like text summarization, plagiarism detection, and question-answering systems. Detecting paraphrases in Urdu text remains challenging due to the language’s complex morphology, distinctive script, and lack of resources such as labelled datasets, pre-trained models, and tailored NLP tools. This research proposes a novel bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) framework to address Urdu paraphrase detection’s intricacies. Our approach employs word embeddings and text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and label encoding to effectively handle Urdu’s morphological variations. The BiLSTM network sequentially processes the input, leveraging both forward and backward contextual information to encode the complex syntactic and semantic patterns inherent in Urdu text. An essential contribution of this work is the creation of a large-scale Urdu Paraphrased Corpus (UPC) comprising 400,000 potential sentence pair duplicates, with 150,000 pairs manually identified as paraphrases. Our findings reveal a significant improvement in paraphrase detection performance compared to existing methods. We provide insights into the underlying linguistic features and patterns that contribute to the robustness of our framework. This resource facilitates training and evaluating Urdu paraphrase detection models. Experimental evaluations on the custom UPC dataset demonstrate our BiLSTM model’s superiority, achieving 94.14% accuracy and outperforming state-of-the-art methods like CNN (83.43%) and LSTM (88.09%). Our model attains an impressive 95.34% accuracy on the benchmark Quora dataset. Furthermore, we incorporate a comprehensive linguistic rule engine to handle exceptional cases during paraphrase analysis, ensuring robust performance across diverse contexts.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has become a predominant method for solving data analysis problems in virtually all fields of science and engineering. The increasing complexity and the large volume of data collected by diverse sensor systems have spurred the development of deep learning methods and have fundamentally transformed the way the data are acquired, processed, analyzed, and interpreted. With the rapid development of deep learning technology and its ever-increasing range of successful applications across diverse sensor systems, there is an urgent need to provide a comprehensive investigation of deep learning in this domain from a holistic view. This survey paper aims to contribute to this by systematically investigating deep learning models/methods and their applications across diverse sensor systems. It also provides a comprehensive summary of deep learning implementation tips and links to tutorials, open-source codes, and pretrained models, which can serve as an excellent self-contained reference for deep learning practitioners and those seeking to innovate deep learning in this space. In addition, this paper provides insights into research topics in diverse sensor systems where deep learning has not yet been well-developed, and highlights challenges and future opportunities. This survey serves as a catalyst to accelerate the application and transformation of deep learning in diverse sensor systems.",

    "abstract": "This review explores the role of prompt engineering in unleashing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Prompt engineering is the process of structuring inputs, and it has emerged as a crucial technique for maximizing the utility and accuracy of these models. Both foundational and advanced prompt engineering methodologies-including techniques such as self-consistency, chain of thought, and generated knowledge, which can significantly enhance the performance of models-are explored in this paper. Additionally, the prompt methods for vision language models (VLMs) are examined in detail. Prompt methods are evaluated with subjective and objective metrics, ensuring a robust analysis of their efficacy. Critical to this discussion is the role of prompt engineering in artificial intelligence (AI) security, particularly in terms of defending against adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs. Strategies for minimizing these risks and improving the robustness of models are thoroughly reviewed. Finally, we provide a perspective for future research and applications.",

    "title": "Earning Extra Performance From Restrictive Feedbacks",
    "year": 2023,
    "citationCount": 1,
    "fieldCitationRatio": 0.58,
    "abstract": "Many machine learning applications encounter situations where model providers are required to further refine the previously trained model so as to gratify the specific need of local users. This problem is reduced to the standard model tuning paradigm if the target data is permissibly fed to the model. However, it is rather difficult in a wide range of practical cases where target data is not shared with model providers but commonly some evaluations about the model are accessible. In this paper, we formally set up a challenge named Earning eXtra PerformancE from restriCTive feEDdbacks (EXPECTED) to describe this form of model tuning problems. Concretely, EXPECTED admits a model provider to access the operational performance of the candidate model multiple times via feedback from a local user (or a group of users). The goal of the model provider is to eventually deliver a satisfactory model to the local user(s) by utilizing the feedbacks. Unlike existing model tuning methods where the target data is always ready for calculating model gradients, the model providers in EXPECTED only see some feedbacks which could be as simple as scalars, such as inference accuracy or usage rate. To enable tuning in this restrictive circumstance, we propose to characterize the geometry of the model performance with regard to model parameters through exploring the parameters' distribution. In particular, for deep models whose parameters distribute across multiple layers, a more query-efficient algorithm is further tailor-designed that conducts layerwise tuning with more attention to those layers which pay off better. Our theoretical analyses justify the proposed algorithms from the aspects of both efficacy and efficiency. Extensive experiments on different applications demonstrate that our work forges a sound solution to the EXPECTED problem, which establishes the foundation for future studies towards this direction.",
