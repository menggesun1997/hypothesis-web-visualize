    "title": "Communication-Efficient Federated Pruning with Linguistic Diversity Awareness",
    "Problem_Statement": "Federated learning with large foundation models suffers from high communication overhead and inefficient scaling, especially in linguistically diverse biomedical domains with heterogeneous data distributions.",
    "Motivation": "Targets internal gaps regarding communication efficiency and lack of resource-aware model compression combined with linguistic adaptation per the landscape map's highlighted opportunities and hidden bridges from model pruning research.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a federated pruning protocol that dynamically prunes model parameters on clients guided by local language domain importance scores. Clients prune layers or neurons less relevant to their local linguistics and only communicate the compressed updates. The server reconstructs a consensus model via an adaptive weighted aggregation that respects linguistic diversity importance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Employ multilingual biomedical datasets such as MIMIC/clinical text in different languages. Start from a large LLaMa variant. Baselines include vanilla FL and existing pruning methods without linguistic awareness. Metrics focus on communication cost reduction, model accuracy on downstream tasks, and fairness across language groups.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Spanish radiology report dataset; Expected Output: A pruned model update reducing communication size by 70% without accuracy drop in named entity recognition compared to full model.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If linguistically-aware pruning harms model utility, revert to structured pruning guided by client compute constraints only; or incorporate quantization as backup compression."

        "title": "Robust Communication-Efficient Federated Pruning with Empirically Validated Linguistic Importance in Multilingual Biomedical NLP",
        "Problem_Statement": "Federated learning of large foundation models in multilingual biomedical domains faces significant communication overhead and challenges in equitable performance due to heterogeneous, linguistically diverse, and often noisy biomedical data. Existing pruning schemes do not reliably incorporate validated linguistic relevance, risking degraded model utility and fairness, especially for underrepresented languages. Hence, there is a critical need for a pruning method that is not only communication-efficient but also rigorously grounded in empirically validated linguistic importance metrics to ensure robust and fair adaptation across diverse biomedical language clients.",
        "Motivation": "While model pruning and federated learning independently address resource and privacy challenges, their integration with linguistic adaptation remains underexplored and has critical assumptions unverified, leading to potential inaccuracies and unfairness in biomedical NLP applications. This work introduces an empirically grounded linguistic importance assessment phase within federated pruning, fortified by a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN)-based importance scorer trained on distilled multilingual biomedical datasets. By grounding pruning decisions in validated importance scores and dynamically adapting pruning granularity according to multilingual data heterogeneity and client resources, this framework fundamentally advances federated pruning beyond existing competitive baselines. The approach explicitly aligns communication efficiency gains with fairness and accuracy retention, targeting scalable federated biomedical NLP with complex linguistic nuances. Integrating dataset distillation and CNN-based scoring enhances reliability and resource feasibility compared to prior heuristic or unvalidated importance assumptions, positioning this method competitively for premier ML/NLP forums.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a three-stage federated pruning protocol: (1) Linguistic Importance Calibration – a lightweight CNN-based importance scoring model trained centrally on distilled multilingual biomedical samples assesses linguistic relevance for model components, validated using cross-client consistency metrics and ablation. This empirical foundation addresses the key assumption gap about importance score reliability in noisy, heterogeneous biomedical NLP contexts. (2) Adaptive Federated Pruning – clients utilize the calibrated importance scores to prune locally, dynamically adjusting pruning granularity based on local data size, compute resources, and importance confidence, guided by a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based controller predicting optimal pruning rates per federated round. (3) Weighted Aggregation with Linguistic-Aware Weights – server aggregates client updates using adaptive weights computed from validated importance scores and fairness metrics, employing statistical parity and worst-group performance evaluations to ensure model equity across languages. The protocol uses quantization as a systematic fallback, triggered by intermediate evaluation metrics not meeting utility thresholds. This method incorporates dataset distillation to reduce communication loads and CNN-based importance scoring to enhance robustness. Experimental reproducibility is ensured through fully specified scoring, aggregation, and fallback criteria, addressing prior underspecifications.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Pretraining phase: Use dataset distillation on multilingual biomedical corpora (e.g., MIMIC, Spanish clinical notes, and others) to create lightweight distilled sets. Train and validate the CNN-based importance scoring model on these sets, evaluating the stability and cross-client consistency of importance scores with ablation studies; confirm no bias against minor languages using fairness metrics. 2) Prototype federated pruning: Deploy the CNN scorer on simulated federated clients with variable data distributions and compute capacities; implement the GRU controller for dynamic pruning granularity adaptation. 3) Run federated learning rounds on large LLaMA descendants and smaller foundation models, comparing vanilla FL, pruning without linguistic awareness, and the proposed method. Measure communication cost, overall and per-language accuracy (including Named Entity Recognition), fairness metrics (statistical parity gap, worst-group accuracy), and model robustness. 4) Conduct fallback trigger experiments: systematically induce fallback pruning or quantization when validation metrics decline, recording effects on accuracy and communication. 5) Perform ablation on aggregation weighting schemes and importance score thresholds for robust conclusions. Resource consumption and scalability will be monitored and reported for all model variants to ensure feasibility and generalizability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Federated setup with heterogeneous clients having Spanish radiology reports and English clinical notes. CNN-based importance scorer identifies relevant neurons and layers per language corpus. Expected Output: The pruned model update reduces communication by over 70% compared to full model transmission, while maintaining or surpassing baseline NER accuracy (within a 1% margin) and exhibiting improved worst-language group fairness (statistical parity gap reduced by at least 15%) relative to non-linguistic pruning baselines.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should CNN importance scores demonstrate instability or degrade minority language utility, fallback involves reverting to a purely structured pruning approach governed by client compute availability only, skipping linguistic weighting. Quantization schemes will be employed as a secondary fallback if pruning alone compromises accuracy or fairness, dynamically triggered via monitored intermediate evaluation metrics during federated rounds. All fallback decisions and criteria will be transparently logged, with subsequent strategies iteratively refined based on comprehensive ablation feedback from experimental phases to ensure robustness without sacrificing key communication efficiency or fairness goals."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that local language domain importance scores can be accurately derived and will effectively guide pruning without significant loss in model utility. However, it is unclear how these importance scores are computed or validated across heterogeneous biomedical language datasets, which can be noisy and have diverse linguistic nuances. Further clarity and validation of this assumption are essential to ensure the pruning decisions truly reflect linguistic relevance and do not degrade model performance on minority or less-resourced languages within the federated setting. Consider empirical evaluation or prior evidences supporting the reliability and stability of such importance scoring methods in federated biomedical NLP contexts before full adoption in the pruning protocol, as failure here risks undermining the entire approach's soundness and equity objectives, especially given biomedical domain sensitivities and language diversity complexities in healthcare data. This could be explicitly addressed in an early ablation or study phase to safeguard method validity prior to large-scale deployment or costly downstream benchmarking experiments in the plan proposed in Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section, where the experimental design should explicitly test importance score quality impact on pruning efficacy and model fairness across languages to reveal potential bottlenecks early on and optimize the protocol robustly with sound linguistic-awareness foundations ahead of comprehensive evaluation on MIMIC or multilingual datasets like clinical text in Spanish and others targeted by the Test_Case_Examples and metrics outlined in the proposal's initial problem statement and motivation framework. Clarifying and backing this core assumption is critical to establish the conceptual and practical feasibility of federated pruning driven by linguistic domain importance scores consistent with the stated goal of maintaining model utility and fairness while cutting communication costs in federated biomedical learning environments with heterogeneous, linguistically diverse data distributions, as fundamentally claimed in your problem motivation and overall research concept scope and strategic framing in the title and main research premise sections of the proposal document. This foundational validation step would substantially bolster the soundness and reliability of the proposed approach’s core innovation and overall contribution to federated learning and pruning research at the intersection with biomedical NLP and multi-language adaptation challenges, which are pivotal to the research's acceptance and reproducibility by the flagship ML and NLP community that ultimately judges methodological rigor and applicability quality for high-impact venues like ACL and NeurIPS where this work is targeted. \"Proposed_Method\" and \"Problem_Statement\" sections should especially emphasize how this critical assumption is justified or empirically supported, to prevent premature reliance on unproven importance score derivations that could compromise later results and impact claims, addressing the [SOU-ASSUMPTION] gap in the current submission setup and strengthening the method's core reliability foundations substantially in real-world federated biomedical NLP multilingual deployment contexts where safety, inclusivity, and accuracy are paramount and mandatory for production-level uptake or clinical translational relevance, avoiding critical pitfalls that too often plague resource-aware pruning combined with linguistic adaptation research breakthroughs otherwise risking systematic bias and model degradation for less represented client languages too frequently seen in federated learning biomedical literature without careful linguistic representativeness considerations integrated early on at assumption and model formulation stages as intended in this proposal framework currently still somewhat underspecified behind the key assumption on importance scores accuracy leading pruning decisions guided by them in the decentralized federated setting proposed here for improved communication efficiency and fairness improvements over vanilla federated learning and non-linguistic pruning baselines in multilingual biomedical contexts targeted by this research work conception and plan described comprehensively in the initial project ideation within this submission's problem, motivation, and methodology chapters, failing which this assumption is a potential bottleneck risking feasibility and soundness downstream per your own experimental design roadmap targeting metric benchmarks for fairness and communication overhead reductions across linguistically diverse biomedical data clients, hence merits prioritized dedicated effort and scrutiny to address and demonstrate satisfactorily with robustness before further scaling or publishing aspirations proceeding further from this idea phase onwards to experimental and impact demonstration phases described in your research plan sections noted above, securing essential trust from peer reviewers and the wider research community in this federated pruning approach innovation proposed, thereby enabling not only competitive novelty positioning but also practical real-world deployment feasibility for improved biomedical NLP federation systems as motivates the overall work presented in your proposal title and problem formulation sections as cited here for clarity reference and completeness of critique scope within the mandated review protocol applied to this work under [SOU-ASSUMPTION] code critique category as requested for actionable internal quality reinforcement feedback to the proposer by the review standards targeted in ACL/NeurIPS style summative holistic in-depth paper reviewing conventions."

          "feedback_content": "The experiment plan aims to demonstrate communication cost reduction and accuracy retention on multilingual biomedical datasets like MIMIC and Spanish clinical reports but currently lacks detailed specification of key practical feasibility factors: 1) How exactly language domain importance scores will be computed and validated per client dataset; 2) Method for adapting pruning granularity dynamically in federated rounds considering varying data sizes and compute availability; and 3) Strategies for measuring fairness concretely beyond accuracy across language groups, such as statistical parity or worst-group performance metrics. Moreover, starting from a large LLaMA variant raises non-trivial scalability and resource concerns, which should be explicitly addressed with approximate resource consumption estimates and fallback options (e.g., smaller foundations, quantization backups). The fallback pruning or quantization schemes are conceptually noted but should be framed as contingency experiments with clear decision criteria based on intermediate evaluation metrics, to avoid experiment plan fragility. Including a pretraining or calibration phase to stabilize importance scores before pruning iterations or prototyping on smaller multilingual biomedical datasets would increase feasibility and reduce risk. Additionally, the aggregation method described as \"adaptive weighted aggregation respecting linguistic diversity importance\" needs clearer experimental operationalization: specify how weights are computed and updated across rounds and languages with linguistic importance indicators, to ensure reproducibility and interpretability. Addressing these practical experimental design aspects will substantially enhance the robustness and scientific soundness of the evaluation plan under realistic federated biomedical multilingual learning constraints and resource limitations, as well as strengthen your evidence to support claimed impact on communication efficiency, model fairness, and accuracy trade-offs outlined in your metrics and test cases for named entity recognition and other downstream tasks documented in your Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan and Test_Case_Examples sections. Clarifying these key procedural and methodological elements is essential for ensuring the experiment plan's practical implementation and scientific credibility, avoiding feasibility pitfalls and enhancing confidence in the approach's scalability and generalizability before wider deployment or publication milestones consistent with best practices expected by premier ML/NLP conferences such as ACL and NeurIPS, aligning with the [FEA-EXPERIMENT] code feedback focus of this review task."
