    "title": "Decentralized Collaborative Annotation Network for Low-Resource Language Healthcare Data with Privacy Guarantees",
    "Problem_Statement": "Scarcity of high-quality annotated linguistic healthcare data for low-resource languages and concerns over data privacy hinder building robust LLMs for these populations.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of underdeveloped NLP techniques for low-resource languages along with external gaps in privacy-aware community-driven data collection, promoting equity and model trust.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a decentralized blockchain-backed annotation platform where patients and healthcare workers collaboratively annotate health conversations. Anonymized contributions are aggregated with cryptographic privacy techniques (e.g., secure multi-party computation) ensuring provenance, auditability, and data privacy. The resulting dataset supports improved Urdu LLM fine-tuning with provenance metadata for transparency.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Deploy annotation platform in telemedicine pilot with Urdu-speaking users. 2. Collect multi-annotator dataset for paraphrase and entity labels. 3. Fine-tune LLMs on collected data with provenance embedding. 4. Evaluate annotation quality, privacy leakage, and model performance over standard datasets.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Raw patient-physician Urdu dialogue. Expected output: High-fidelity annotated transcripts with privacy metadata enabling trustworthy LLM training.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain scalability issues arise, revert to federated annotation with encrypted aggregation; if user participation is low, incentivize with token rewards or gamification."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that blockchain technology, along with cryptographic privacy techniques such as secure multi-party computation, can be effectively integrated in a telemedicine annotation platform for low-resource Urdu-speaking populations. However, it does not sufficiently justify or analyze challenges related to user technical literacy, infrastructure constraints, or the overhead introduced by these privacy-preserving mechanisms. Additionally, the assumption that patients and healthcare workers will collaboratively and accurately annotate sensitive health conversations requires empirical backing or prior user studies to establish viability and trust. The team should provide stronger evidence or references supporting these foundational assumptions to ensure soundness of the proposed approach and anticipate potential barriers in deployment and user engagement in this specific context. Consider incorporating a preliminary user needs assessment to validate these assumptions before full platform development."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "While the outlined step-by-step experimental plan covers deployment, data collection, model fine-tuning, and evaluation, it lacks detailed operational specifics necessary to assess feasibility. Key aspects such as strategies for recruiting and training annotators, ensuring annotation consistency, metrics and protocols for privacy leakage evaluation, and benchmarks for annotation and model quality need elaboration. Moreover, blockchain scalability concerns are acknowledged but require a clearer fallback protocol with concrete criteria triggering method switch. Feasibility would be strengthened by specifying data volume targets, annotation timelines, resource estimates, and risks mitigation plans. Explicitly detailing the mechanism to embed provenance metadata into LLM fine-tuning and how it affects model performance evaluation will also improve clarity. A pilot or simulation phase focusing on user interaction and privacy trade-offs before full-scale rollout is recommended."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "To enhance impact and novelty given the competitive nature of blockchain-based privacy-preserving NLP approaches, consider integrating insights from 'blockchain-based federated learning' and 'permissioned blockchain' concepts. For example, adopting a permissioned blockchain model tailored to healthcare institutions could improve transaction throughput and governance, addressing scalability issues. Furthermore, incorporating federated learning paradigms where model updates—not raw data or annotations—are exchanged can complement anonymization techniques and reduce privacy leakage risk. Embedding structured medical data standards akin to the 'Common Data Model' could improve interoperability and downstream utility. Leveraging these aligned domains may elevate the proposal's technical rigor, expand applicability beyond Urdu healthcare dialogues, and strengthen trustworthiness in sensitive healthcare NLP tasks."
