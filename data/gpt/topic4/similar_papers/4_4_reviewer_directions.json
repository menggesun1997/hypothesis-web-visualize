    "Problem_Statement": "Federated adaptation of foundation models across linguistically diverse biomedical data is resource-intensive with limited exploration of architectural optimization in this space.",
    "Motivation": "Closes an external gap by integrating resource-aware NAS techniques with FL for multilingual biomedical models, targeting scalability and communication limits identified in the research landscape.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a federated neural architecture search framework that simultaneously optimizes model subnetworks tailored to individual language groups, constrained by client device capabilities and communication budgets. Search is privacy-aware and incentivizes lightweight architectures maintaining high biomedical NLP accuracy.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Use multilingual biomedical NLP datasets from low to high-resource languages. Compare architectures discovered via NAS-FL with static large FMs. Metrics include model size, latency, accuracy on clinical tasks, and communication overhead.",

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan outlines evaluation on multilingual biomedical NLP datasets from low- to high-resource languages, comparing NAS-optimized architectures against static foundation models. However, it lacks detail on addressing the inherent challenges of federated neural architecture search (NAS) convergence in realistic, heterogeneous federated environments with highly variable client capabilities and network conditions. Specifically, it does not clarify how privacy constraints and communication limitations will be balanced during the search process or how the search efficiency will be ensured in resource-constrained settings. Strengthening this section with more explicit protocols, simulation or real federated environment details, and fallback mechanisms beyond just reducing search space dimension is essential to establish the feasibility and robustness of the experiment plan in practice, particularly for sensitive biomedical data across diverse language groups with limited resources and varying device profiles. This detail is critical for reviewers and stakeholders to trust the practical viability of the approach under real-world constraints, which are often more complex than assumed in preliminary designs! Furthermore, clarifying how latency and communication overhead metrics will be measured dynamically during NAS would improve the practicality and replicability of the experiments. Without these clarifications, the experiment plan risks appearing overly idealized and underprepared for concrete implementation challenges, potentially undermining the proposal’s feasibility claims. Therefore, the experiment plan should explicitly incorporate realistic federated simulation protocols, adaptive search strategies, and detailed evaluation methodologies to guarantee sound scientific validation of the proposed method's practicality and effectiveness in federated biomedical NLP contexts across languages and resource profiles.  Please elaborate accordingly in your next iteration to ensure strong feasibility evidence and realistic experimentation protocols to fully convince reviewers of the method's viability in real-world federated biomedical NLP setups across languages and devices with constrained resources and privacy requirements.  Thank you!  This is a critical point needing thorough attention to confidently move forward with the work and its eventual impact potential!  Cheers!  — Reviewer AC #1 — \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment highlights this idea as [NOV-COMPETITIVE] in a highly active space integrating federated learning, neural architecture search, and multilingual biomedical modeling, a strategic enhancement could be to integrate domain-specific pre-training or multimodal learning elements into the federated NAS framework. For example, leveraging pre-trained biomedical text embedding models in the NAS search space could accelerate architecture adaptation and improve downstream clinical NLP accuracy without substantially increasing client computation. Alternatively, incorporating multimodal data such as clinical text and retinal nerve fiber layer images or other biomedical signals into a federated NAS setting could differentiate this work by exploring joint architecture optimization across heterogeneous modalities under resource constraints, thus broadening impact beyond pure text-based NLP. This integration would not only increase novelty by bridging currently separate research streams (domain-specific pre-training, multimodal learning, federated NAS) but also enhance real-world healthcare relevance and applicability. Given the biomedical focus and the presence of globally-linked concepts like domain-specific pre-training, retinal nerve fiber layer, and visual question answering, I strongly suggest investigating how these complementary modalities or embeddings can be incorporated into your federated NAS pipeline. Doing so can elevate the proposal's competitive edge, expand scientific contributions, and improve adoption potential in diverse healthcare AI scenarios requiring privacy, multilingual support, and multimodal understanding. In sum, take advantage of global linked concepts by extending your federated NAS approach with domain-specific pre-training and/or multimodal learning components, synthesizing recent advances to create a uniquely valuable and impactful resource-aware multilingual federated biomedical foundation modeling framework. This would greatly strengthen both novelty and downstream impact, efficiently leveraging current best practices and emerging trends in AI for healthcare. Thank you! — Reviewer AC #1 —"
