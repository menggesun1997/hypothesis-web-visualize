    "title": "Multi-Scale Attention Models for Bias-Resilient Narrative Segmentation in Low-Resource Languages",
    "Problem_Statement": "Keyword-based and traditional text segmentation methods perform poorly and propagate bias in multilingual low-resource settings, particularly with narrative data rich in cultural and linguistic nuances.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the brittleness and bias propagation in early structured data extraction stages (internal gap) by adapting multi-scale self-attention mechanisms from advanced computer vision and biomedical image segmentation (external bridge), enhancing contextual understanding in multilingual narrative segmentation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We develop a novel hierarchical multi-scale attention LLM architecture that segments narratives at multiple granularities, leveraging cross-lingual transfer learning and context-aware representation to minimize bias propagation. This architecture integrates positional embeddings with modality-inspired attention patterns to capture linguistic and cultural subtleties across languages.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble multilingual narrative datasets from child protective services and similar sensitive domains. 2) Implement baseline segmentation models using keyword and conventional methods. 3) Develop and train multi-scale attention segmentation models with transfer learning. 4) Evaluate segmentation quality, bias metrics, and downstream fairness in structured data extraction.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Narrative text describing social service case in low-resource language (e.g., Amharic). Output: Accurate segmented fields reflecting unbiased representation versus keyword baseline.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-scale attention doesn't sufficiently improve segmentation, fallback to ensemble models combining rule-based and neural approaches with human review integration."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposal describes a hierarchical multi-scale attention LLM architecture that integrates positional embeddings and modality-inspired attention patterns, the methodological details are insufficiently clarified. Specifically, how the multi-scale attention mechanism is adapted from computer vision and biomedical segmentation domains to narrative text segmentation in low-resource, multilingual contexts needs deeper exposition. Clarify the architecture's components, how cross-lingual transfer learning is incorporated, and how cultural and linguistic nuances are explicitly modeled within the attention mechanisms to justify soundness and novelty of the method beyond a straightforward adaptation. This will strengthen confidence in the proposed mechanism's rigor and validity.  Targeting this clarification will also aid reproducibility and evaluation of core assumptions in bias mitigation via the architecture's design strategies in narrative segmentation tasks.\n\n\n---\n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"

However, the feasibility is threatened by challenges in sourcing sufficiently large, ethically accessible, and annotated multilingual narrative datasets in low-resource languages, especially from child protective services or similar domains. Please specify data sourcing strategies, annotation methodologies, and ethical compliance considerations to bolster practical feasibility. Additionally, clarify the bias metrics and downstream fairness measures with references to measurable standards or frameworks. Including a timeline or resource assessment would further demonstrate realism. Addressing these points will ensure the experimental plan is actionable and scientifically sound in the given challenging context.\n\n\n---\n\nTarget section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
