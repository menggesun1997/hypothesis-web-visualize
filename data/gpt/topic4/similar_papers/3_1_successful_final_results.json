        "title": "Federated Edge-Enabled Adaptive Compression with Differential Privacy for Real-Time Privacy-Preserving LLM Inference in Low-Resource Languages in Telehealth",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current adaptive compression and privacy preservation techniques for large language model (LLM) inference struggle with deployment feasibility in low-resource languages under constrained connectivity and hardware, especially in sensitive telehealth settings. Existing methods do not fully address real-time edge inference while guaranteeing rigorous privacy-utility trade-offs, nor do they leverage decentralized data via federated learning for robust personalization and continual adaptation on resource-limited patient devices.",
        "Motivation": "Despite advances in adaptive compression and privacy-aware LLM inference, there exists a critical gap in integrating these with federated learning and differential privacy to harness decentralized patient data in low-resource linguistic environments (e.g., Urdu telehealth) with resource-constrained edge devices. Addressing this gap enables robust, personalized, privacy-guaranteed language understanding directly on patient devices, minimizing cloud dependency and data leakage risk. Our approach innovatively synthesizes adaptive compressed LLM submodules with federated learning and differential privacy, explicitly optimizing privacy-utility trade-offs and deployability under constrained hardware and connectivity. This fills a pressing need in privacy-preserving medical AI at the network edge, unlocking real-time, culturally and linguistically appropriate telemedical services in underserved populations.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a federated edge inference framework combining adaptive compression, differential privacy, and continual federated learning for LLMs in low-resource language telehealth settings. Key components include: 1) Lightweight LLM submodules compressed via pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation to enable efficient edge inference on constrained devices. 2) Token-level privacy and linguistic complexity scoring metrics operationalized via annotated proxy datasets and linguistic features, guiding dynamic activation of compressed submodules and compression ratios per input segment in real time, balancing latency, accuracy, and privacy risk. 3) Integration of federated learning protocols augmented with differential privacy noise mechanisms at both training and inference stages, enabling decentralized, privacy-preserving model personalization and continual updates across patient devices without raw data sharing. 4) Secure device shadow synchronization protocols simulating cloud-edge context state management with cryptographic authentication and integrity checks to ensure system coherence and privacy. 5) A detailed evaluation pipeline quantifying privacy leakage (via membership inference and differential privacy budgets), latency, accuracy, energy consumption, and robustness across connectivity scenarios on representative edge hardware (e.g., ARM Cortex processors) running Urdu telehealth NLP workloads.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop and validate token-level privacy sensitivity and linguistic complexity metrics using curated Urdu telehealth proxy datasets annotated for privacy risk and linguistic difficulty; quantify metric reliability and correlation with privacy leakage. 2) Construct lightweight compressed LLM submodules via knowledge distillation, pruning, and quantization; benchmark computation cost, memory footprint, and inference latency on common edge processors. 3) Implement federated learning pipeline with differential privacy noise addition on training and inference, simulating realistic device cohorts with heterogeneous data; analyze privacy-utility trade-offs under varying noise budgets. 4) Simulate secure device shadow protocol for context synchronization using cryptographic schemes; measure synchronization overhead and resilience against adversarial conditions. 5) Conduct ablation studies varying compression levels and privacy noise parameters to map trade-offs among latency, accuracy, privacy leakage, and energy consumption. 6) Evaluate robustness under variable and intermittent network connectivity with real-world telehealth usage scenarios on edge hardware; assess system degradation modes. 7) Synthesize results to validate feasibility, privacy guarantees, and deployment readiness in resource-constrained telehealth environments for Urdu and comparable low-resource languages.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Test Input: Patient vocal query in Urdu processed locally to generate tokens with annotated privacy sensitivity scores. Expected Output: Rapid, privacy-preserving medical advice generated primarily on-device or with minimal encrypted federated updates, maintaining data confidentiality and linguistic accuracy. Evaluation includes membership inference attacks showing bounded privacy leakage within differential privacy budget; latency within predefined real-time thresholds (<500ms); and energy consumption suitable for typical patient edge devices. Robustness tests simulate network outages and verify continuous partial model adaptation and inference ability without cloud reliance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If hardware constraints prove prohibitive for full edge inference, transition to a hybrid split inference model wherein encrypted intermediate representations are exchanged with a cloud-based federated aggregation server minimizing raw data exposure. If token privacy scoring metrics show low predictive validation, integrate formal differential privacy noise injection mechanisms and adaptive dynamic thresholds to compensate. Should federated learning be limited by patient device heterogeneity or connectivity, leverage federated distillation and model ensembling to enable indirect knowledge transfer while maintaining privacy guarantees. Additional hardware acceleration strategies or lightweight model architecture redesigns will be explored to meet efficiency targets."

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experimental plan lacks detail on validating and quantifying the token-level privacy scoring metric's effectiveness, which is critical as it underpins the adaptive compression strategy. Defining clear criteria for privacy sensitivity and linguistic complexity, along with benchmarks or datasets for low-resource languages like Urdu, is essential. Additionally, simulating device shadow states for secure context synchronization needs a more concrete technical approach and evaluation metrics. To ensure feasibility, I recommend including development of motivated proxy datasets, ablation studies on compression-privacy trade-offs, and a clear protocol for robustness tests under realistic connectivity scenarios within the plan. This will strengthen confidence that the proposed method can successfully balance privacy, latency, and accuracy in low-resource edge deployments, particularly in telehealth settings where stakes are high and resources limited. Consider also evaluating energy consumption and hardware constraints explicitly for edge devices to verify practicality beyond latency and accuracy metrics alone in realistic conditions (e.g., common edge processors). This would demonstrate thorough feasibility assessment across system dimensions critical for deployment in resource-constrained environments and healthcare contexts in particular, thus preventing downstream surprises that could derail deployment feasibility despite conceptual novelty or good intentions in method design and evaluation planning as currently outlined in the proposal's Experiment_Plan section. \n\nRecommendation: Expand the experimental plan with concrete dataset/resource details, quantitative metrics for privacy scoring, detailed simulation setup for device shadow, inclusion of hardware constraints and efficiency metrics, and more granular latency/accuracy trade-off analysis to robustly validate feasibility assumptions explicit in the proposal's motivation and methods sections. This is vital for the idea to move beyond high-level conceptual novelty into demonstrable system feasibility, especially given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty pre-screening and high stakes of medical data privacy and real-time edge inference requirements outlined in the Problem_Statement and Motivation sections of the proposal. This targeted improvement will substantially de-risk the proposed deployment approach and strengthen sound feasibility claims typical of a premier ACL or NeurIPS conference paper's posture in privacy-preserving adaptive compressed edge LLM inference research challenging low-resource telehealth applications currently under-served and highly constrained by connectivity, privacy, and hardware at the patient device level as claimed in the submission. \n\nIn summary: Make experimental plan details explicit, closely integrated with privacy metric validation, simulation fidelity for device shadow synchrony, and hardware-aware feasibility to elevate the proposal's rigor and credibility in feasibility dimension beyond its current abstract description within Experiment_Plan, Proposed_Method, and Problem_Statement sections. This strengthens the foundation of sound execution feasibility needed for acceptance and impactful real-world adoption.\n\n\n---\n\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty classification and the proposal's core focus on adaptive compression and privacy preservation on edge devices in low-resource languages for LLM inference, I recommend integrating federated learning with differential privacy techniques into the design. Specifically, incorporating federated learning can allow decentralized training or continual adaptation of the compressed LLM submodules directly on patient devices (or a cohort of devices), leveraging patient data locally while maintaining privacy, enhancing model robustness and personalization in resource-scarce languages such as Urdu. Coupling this with differential privacy mechanisms—already suggested as a fallback but here elevated as an integral component—can rigorously quantify and guarantee privacy-utility trade-offs during both training and inference phases. This integration addresses novelty by harmonizing edge-device adaptive compression with state-of-the-art privacy-preserving decentralized learning schemes, leveraging growing momentum in federated learning's application for medical NLP and privacy protection. Moreover, such a combination can improve impact by enabling scalable, privacy-ensured model updates sensitive to user data heterogeneity common in healthcare telehealth scenarios, while potentially mitigating the need for frequent cloud interaction. I also suggest exploring knowledge distillation to create lightweight, compressed student models tailored for edge deployment enhanced by this federated pipeline, potentially boosting inference efficiency and privacy protection simultaneously. Overall, embedding federated learning and differential privacy into the adaptive compression edge inference framework can significantly boost competitiveness, novelty, and breadth of impact as linked concepts relevant to the proposal's domain indicate. This would make the approach more robust, explainable, and aligned with cutting-edge privacy preserving AI trends required for premier conferences and real world data-sensitive telemedical LLM applications in low-resource linguistic environments, thus elevating the proposal's standing within the research community and practical deployment considerations. Please consider expanding the Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan sections accordingly to incorporate these synergies with appropriate evaluation metrics and system integration details to fully realize potential gains in novelty and impact beyond current state of the art described. This helps transform a novel method combination into a more comprehensive, forward-looking privacy-preserving edge LLM framework bridging key gaps identified in the Motivation and Problem_Statement sections, strongly aligned with relevant globally linked concepts enumerated in the assignment prompt."
