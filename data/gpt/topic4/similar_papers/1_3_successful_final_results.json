        "title": "Typology-Aware Curriculum Learning for Low-Resource Language Modeling",
        "Problem_Statement": "Standard large language model training pipelines generally treat low-resource languages uniformly, without adapting dynamically to their diverse typological characteristics and challenges. This oversight limits the effectiveness of model learning and cross-lingual transfer, especially for languages with complex morphological and syntactic structures underrepresented in training data.",
        "Motivation": "Existing curriculum learning methods rarely incorporate linguistically grounded, quantitative typological information that reflects intrinsic language complexity. By explicitly integrating standardized typological complexity metrics into the training curriculum, our approach aims to tailor learning sequences that progressively expose the model to languages of increasing structural complexity. This addresses a critical gap in prior work by combining principled linguistic theory with reinforcement learning and distributed training infrastructures to optimize resource use and improve representations for typologically diverse, low-resource languages. Our method is distinctive in its rigorous formalization and operationalization of typology-aware training dynamics, which we hypothesize will lead to more sample-efficient learning and fairer cross-lingual performance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a curriculum learning framework grounded in rigorously defined typological complexity scores derived from a multidimensional linguistic feature set, including morphological richness, syntactic configurationality, and phonological inventory characteristics, sourced and validated from typological databases like WALS and supplemented with expert annotations. 1) Typological Complexity Scoring: We compute language-specific scores using a weighted aggregation of normalized typological features, calibrated through principal component analysis and clustering to ensure meaningful gradients of complexity. 2) Adaptive Batch Scheduler: Using these scores, the scheduler sequences multilingual training batches from simpler to more complex languages, modulated dynamically via a reinforcement learning agent that optimizes progression rates based on model performance signals. We present detailed pseudocode for the scheduling policy that samples batches proportional to a curriculum function combining complexity score and training loss, allowing flexible batching strategies. 3) Typology Embedding Module: A multitask LLM architecture is enhanced by a learnable typology embedding encoding the computed language feature vectors, concatenated with token embeddings to condition the model to typological properties explicitly. 4) Distributed Training Optimization: We formulate a load balancing algorithm that adapts the batch distribution to heterogeneous compute nodes with deadlines, minimizing idle times and ensuring timely progression through the curriculum. Algorithmic diagrams illustrate interactions between typology embeddings, batch scheduling, and distributed optimization. These components together operationalize a strongly grounded yet practically feasible typology-aware curriculum learning paradigm that bridges linguistic theory with scalable training dynamics.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Collection and Metric Definition: Aggregate cross-linguistic typological features from WALS, URIEL, and Ethnologue databases; engage linguistic experts to validate and refine complexity metrics and weighting schemes; perform dimension reduction to derive robust composite complexity scores. 2. Corpus Preparation: Collect and preprocess multilingual corpora for selected low-resource languages, ensuring alignment with typological datasets; perform data augmentation or synthetic corpus generation where corpora are limited. 3. Model Implementation: Develop the multitask LLM with typology embedding; implement the RL-based adaptive batch scheduler and distributed training optimizer as per algorithmic specifications. 4. Training Regimes: Conduct comparative training of models with (a) typology-aware curriculum scheduler and (b) baseline uniform scheduling; track convergence metrics, compute load balancing efficacy, and monitor training speedups. 5. Evaluation Benchmarking: Use typology-sensitive evaluation tasks like morphological generation, syntactic parsing, and cross-lingual transfer assessments focusing on low-resource languages such as Inuktitut, Quechua, and Navajo. For languages lacking benchmarks, design proxy zero-shot or few-shot tasks and create small evaluation datasets using linguistic experts and crowdsourcing. 6. Robustness and Ablation Studies: Analyze the impact of individual typological features and curriculum parameters on performance; test fallback schemes with partial or metadata-augmented curricula. 7. Reporting: Document all experimental configurations, compute timelines, and resource utilization statistics to assess scientific rigor and practical deployment feasibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A morphologically rich low-resource language sentence from Inuktitut, e.g., 'ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ ᐊᒻᒪ ᐊᓘᓐᓂᖅ' ('The Inuit are fishing'). Expected Output: The model trained with the typology-aware curriculum correctly generates and understands complex morphological structures, outperforming the baseline by higher morphological accuracy (e.g., F1 score improvement on morpheme segmentation and tagging). Another example includes parsing complex syntactic structures in Quechua with improved labeled attachment scores. Additionally, evaluations demonstrate faster convergence and more balanced performance gains across modeled languages.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the full curriculum scheduling framework results in slower convergence or excessive computational overhead, we will pivot to a partial curriculum approach that applies typology-informed weighting to batch sampling without strict ordering, or incorporate typological metadata as soft conditioning signals in the multitask model without scheduler constraints. Additionally, fallback evaluation strategies will focus on proxy typology-sensitive tasks through transfer learning from related high-resource languages, leveraging zero-shot settings to measure gains. We will also explore heuristic scheduling techniques informed by linguistic insights to approximate the curriculum effects with reduced complexity."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a scheduler sequencing training batches by typological complexity and mentions a multitask LLM with a typology embedding module, but the mechanism lacks clarity regarding how typological complexity scores are computed and integrated into training dynamics. It would strengthen the proposal to explicitly describe the typological complexity metrics, how they quantitatively influence batch sampling and model conditioning, and how the adaptive distributed training schedules are optimized in practice. Clarifying these mechanistic details is critical for reproducibility and convincing demonstration of soundness in adapting curriculum to typology-specific signals. Consider adding algorithmic pseudocode or diagrams to elucidate the scheduling and embedding integration processes more concretely within the multitask architecture context, thereby improving theoretical and implementation clarity, as well as hypothesis grounding in linguistic typology literature variants and reinforcement learning principles referenced in the Motivation section. This will directly improve soundness and reviewer confidence in the link between linguistic theory and model training methodology integration, currently only high-level described but not detailed mathematically or procedurally in the proposal's current form (Proposed_Method section)."

          "feedback_content": "The Experiment_Plan is generally well-structured but may face feasibility challenges both in defining suitable typological complexity metrics and in reliably benchmarking improvements across low-resource languages given data scarcity and variability. Step 1 lacks details regarding data sources and validation for selecting or synthesizing typological complexity scores; establishing standardized, interpretable, and linguistically motivated metrics here is nontrivial and essential for downstream curriculum quality. Additionally, Step 4's benchmarking relies heavily on typology-sensitive tasks like morphological prediction and syntactic parsing; however, these benchmarks may be under-resourced or absent for truly low-resource languages mentioned such as Inuktitut, potentially requiring additional corpus creation or augmentation that is not accounted for in the plan. To improve feasibility, supplement the plan with more concrete strategies for (a) curating, validating, and standardizing typological complexity metrics, including linguistic expert involvement or crowdsourcing approaches, and (b) ensuring availability or construction of reliable typology-sensitive benchmarks or proxy tasks for evaluation, possibly leveraging zero-shot or few-shot settings. Detailing fallback evaluation plans and resource needs, as well as clear computational load and timeline estimates for distributed training experiments, would further enhance scientific and practical rigor of the experiment plan."
