        "title": "Community-Driven Privacy Adaptive LLMs for Urdu-speaking Telehealth Users",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM privacy-preserving methods lack cultural sensitivity and transparency, limiting adoption within Urdu-speaking healthcare communities, especially in telehealth contexts where linguistic diversity and data privacy must be balanced.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the internal gap of limited customization and transparency in LLMs for equitable healthcare adoption, while leveraging the external gap spotlighting community-based participatory research and privacy preservation for low-resource languages like Urdu.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a participatory framework that co-designs LLM fine-tuning pipelines integrating community feedback loops with privacy-preserving federated learning techniques. This integrates culturally-aware privacy policies and localized paraphrase detection to dynamically adapt privacy-utility trade-offs. The architecture allows community representatives to guide data usage policies, ensuring transparency and equitable LLM behavior for Urdu telehealth users.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect Urdu health dialogue datasets via community consent. 2. Fine-tune existing LLMs using federated learning with adaptive compression techniques. 3. Implement feedback modules for community participants to evaluate privacy and utility. 4. Compare against baseline LLMs without participatory design on metrics: privacy leakage, accuracy in paraphrase detection, and user trust surveys. 5. Perform ablation on privacy policies' transparency effects.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient message in Urdu mentioning a sensitive health condition. Expected output: LLM generates responses preserving privacy (e.g., redacting identifiers while maintaining medical relevance). User feedback indicates improved trust and cultural appropriateness compared to standard models.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated learning shows limited convergence, fallback to secure multi-party computation for model updates; if community feedback integration delays training, use simulated community preferences or proxy cultural metrics."

        "title": "Edge-Enabled Adaptive Compression for Real-Time Privacy-Preserving LLM Inference in Low-Resource Languages",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing adaptive compression privacy techniques lack deployment feasibility in low-resource language settings with limited connectivity, preventing real-time, privacy-preserving LLM inference on edge devices in healthcare.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap revealing a lack of integration between adaptive compressed privacy methods and edge/device shadow technologies in resource-constrained settings, aiming for decentralized privacy-aware LLM usage directly on patient devices.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a lightweight edge inference pipeline using compressed LLM submodules dynamically activated based on linguistic complexity and privacy sensitivity of input. Incorporate device shadow states to synchronize context securely with cloud models without sharing raw sensitive data. Utilize token-level privacy scoring to adjust compression and inference pathways in real time, enabling low-latency responses in languages like Urdu.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop token privacy scoring metrics for Urdu telehealth inputs. 2. Build edge deployment of compressed LLM modules using pruning and quantization. 3. Integrate device shadow simulation to secure context sync. 4. Benchmark latency, privacy leakage (via membership inference tests), and accuracy against cloud-only baselines. 5. Test robustness under variable connectivity scenarios.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient's vocal Urdu health query preprocessed and tokenized locally. Expected output: Fast, privacy-preserving medically accurate response generated locally or with minimal cloud interaction, preserving data confidentiality.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If edge hardware constraints are critical, shift to hybrid on-device/cloud split inference with encrypted data transfer; if token privacy scoring underperforms, incorporate differential privacy noise mechanisms."

        "title": "Multi-Modal Privacy-Aware Federated LLM Framework for Culturally Tailored Health Communication",
        "Problem_Statement": "There is a gap in frameworks that integrate multimodal linguistic data (text, voice) from culturally diverse populations securely into LLM training while preserving privacy and localization in healthcare delivery.",
        "Motivation": "Fills the internal gap on real-world validation of privacy-preserving methods beyond text-only datasets, focusing on cross-modal, culturally tailored datasets; bridges gaps in telemedicine multilingual data collection and privacy.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create a federated learning pipeline where multi-modal data (spoken Urdu, written health notes) are locally preprocessed to extract linguistic features and anonymized embeddings, encrypted for secure aggregation. The LLM fine-tuning adapts to each modality distinctly with privacy budgets controlling contribution per participant. Incorporate culturally relevant prompts via participatory design.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multimodal datasets from Urdu-speaking patients (audio + text). 2. Implement on-device pre-processing pipelines for anonymization. 3. Train federated LLMs with privacy budgets. 4. Measure downstream health dialog task accuracy, privacy leakage, and cross-modal coherence. 5. Compare to centralized and unimodal training baselines.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient query recorded via voice in Urdu along with typed health history. Expected output: Accurate multi-modal response supporting clinical decision with zero recovery of raw identifiable data.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated learning multi-modal fusion is unstable, separately train modality-specific sub-models with ensemble fusion; if privacy budget constraints reduce accuracy excessively, explore adaptive privacy budget allocation per modality."

        "title": "Culturally Sensitive Privacy Metrics for Dynamic User Control in LLM Healthcare Applications",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current privacy metrics applied in LLMs do not reflect cultural variations in privacy expectations, reducing trust and equitable technology adoption in diverse linguistic groups like Urdu speakers in telemedicine.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap of limited transparency and customization in privacy-preserving LLM pathways by embedding culturally informed privacy metrics and personalized control mechanisms, a novel sociotechnical approach.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a culturally adaptive privacy scoring system that maps community-driven privacy concerns into formal privacy budget parameters for LLM training/inference. Integrate a user-facing control panel that allows patients to specify privacy preferences influencing local model behavior dynamically, mediated through continuous learning to balance privacy-utility trade-offs respecting cultural norms.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Conduct participatory studies to elicit privacy norms from Urdu-speaking communities. 2. Formalize cultural privacy metrics translating qualitative inputs into quantitative privacy parameters. 3. Implement adaptive LLM inference controlled by these metrics. 4. Evaluate via simulated telehealth sessions measuring privacy preservation, model utility, and user satisfaction.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User marks certain health topics as highly sensitive. Expected output: LLM response generation excludes sensitive information with enhanced obfuscation, validated by user trust ratings.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If cultural privacy preferences cannot be reliably quantified, fallback to region-based heuristic privacy profiles; if adaptive control degrades model utility, implement post-hoc sanitization layers."

        "title": "Decentralized Collaborative Annotation Network for Low-Resource Language Healthcare Data with Privacy Guarantees",
        "Problem_Statement": "Scarcity of high-quality annotated linguistic healthcare data for low-resource languages and concerns over data privacy hinder building robust LLMs for these populations.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of underdeveloped NLP techniques for low-resource languages along with external gaps in privacy-aware community-driven data collection, promoting equity and model trust.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a decentralized blockchain-backed annotation platform where patients and healthcare workers collaboratively annotate health conversations. Anonymized contributions are aggregated with cryptographic privacy techniques (e.g., secure multi-party computation) ensuring provenance, auditability, and data privacy. The resulting dataset supports improved Urdu LLM fine-tuning with provenance metadata for transparency.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Deploy annotation platform in telemedicine pilot with Urdu-speaking users. 2. Collect multi-annotator dataset for paraphrase and entity labels. 3. Fine-tune LLMs on collected data with provenance embedding. 4. Evaluate annotation quality, privacy leakage, and model performance over standard datasets.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Raw patient-physician Urdu dialogue. Expected output: High-fidelity annotated transcripts with privacy metadata enabling trustworthy LLM training.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain scalability issues arise, revert to federated annotation with encrypted aggregation; if user participation is low, incentivize with token rewards or gamification."
