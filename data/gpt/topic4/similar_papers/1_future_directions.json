        "title": "Typological Reinforcement Training for Dynamic LLM Adaptation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language models inadequately encode explicit linguistic typological features, resulting in poor structural diversity representation especially for low-resource languages. This gap reduces model fairness and utility in multilingual applications.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of integrating linguistic typology knowledge explicitly into LLM training. Leverages opportunity 1 by combining typological knowledge with reinforcement learning and distributed computing for dynamic adaptation, overcoming typical data scarcity and infrastructural bottlenecks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel training framework where linguistic typological features (e.g., word order, morphological typology) are encoded as an auxiliary input signal that guides a deep reinforcement learning agent during LLM pretraining on dynamically sampled language tasks. The training is distributed across fog-cloud infrastructure enabling scalable resource allocation respecting training deadlines. The agent learns policies to balance typological diversity and language data scarcity by adaptive curriculum learning focused on underrepresented structures.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate multilingual datasets enriched with typological annotations from WALS and other linguistic databases. 2. Pretrain baseline multilingual LLMs without typology. 3. Implement the RL-augmented training with distributed fog-cloud setup. 4. Evaluate on benchmarks probing typological generalization and low-resource language understanding. 5. Compare to baselines on language coverage, generation diversity, and typology-sensitive metrics.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence in Quechua with subject-object-verb order. Expected Output: Accurate semantic understanding and generation respecting Quechua-specific word order, compared against baseline models that misinterpret or reorder incorrectly.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If reinforcement learning convergence is unstable, replace RL with a multi-task learning setup incorporating typological tasks explicitly. If distributed training incurs latency, simulate scaled-down setups before broader deployment."

        "title": "Cross-modal Typological Embeddings for Multilingual Dialogue Systems",
        "Problem_Statement": "Multilingual dialogue systems lack explicit integration of typological cues across modalities, leading to limited cultural and linguistic diversity representation, and poor user experience in minoritized languages.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap of typological knowledge integration and explores opportunity 2 by combining digital literacy frameworks and multilingual dialogue generation with typology-aware embeddings, filling socio-technical mismatches for vulnerable communities.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a multi-modal, typology-informed embedding space combining textual typological features and dialogue act structural patterns. Train a dialogue system that conditions utterance generation not only on content but also on typological context vector, enabling culturally congruent and structurally aware responses. Integrate user feedback loops from digital literacy platforms to iteratively refine language- and culture-specific interaction styles.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multilingual dialogue datasets with typological meta-data. 2. Extract typological and cultural embedding features from linguistic databases and user demographic info. 3. Train typology-conditioned dialogue models. 4. Deploy prototype in partnered minoritized language communities for user testing and feedback collection. 5. Quantitatively evaluate response appropriateness, linguistic diversity, and user satisfaction metrics.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User query in Yoruba requesting health advice. Expected Output: A culturally sensitive and grammatically correct Yoruba dialogue response incorporating local idioms and respecting Yoruba typology, improving accessibility and trust.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If typology embeddings degrade dialogue performance, trial a hierarchical approach separating semantic and typological conditioning streams. If user feedback is insufficient, simulate feedback through expert annotation."

        "title": "Resilient Collaborative Typology-Enriched Language Dataset Pipelines",
        "Problem_Statement": "Collaborative development of multilingual language resources suffers from disruption (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) leading to fragmented, incomplete typology-enriched datasets and slowing progress on diverse LLM representations.",
        "Motivation": "Responds directly to the external socio-technical gap exposed by the COVID-19 bridge node and opportunity 3, developing resilient, ethical resource construction pipelines that unify digital humanities and dialogue research under constraints like remote collaboration or resource scarcity.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create an open-source, blockchain-based decentralized platform for collaborative language dataset curation that embeds linguistic typology metadata, tracks provenance, and incentivizes ethical contributions. Integrate continuous integration for dataset validation and auto-alignment with dialogue and digital humanities tools. The platform supports offline-first modes and peer-to-peer synchronization to overcome connectivity issues seen during global disruptions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop prototype platform incorporating typological annotation tools. 2. Partner with language communities to pilot data collection. 3. Deploy tools for dataset validation aligning with dialogue systems requirements. 4. Evaluate platform resilience under simulated network partitions and contributor variability. 5. Measure impact on dataset completeness and typological diversity before and after deployment.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Use case: Minoritized language activists collaboratively upload text corpora tagged with morphological typology via mobile devices in rural areas; the platform manages synchronization and incentivizes quality contributions, resulting in richer, structured datasets accessible for LLM training.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain proves too heavy, use federated database alternatives. If user adoption is low, simplify UI/UX and provide richer contributor incentives or gamification."

        "title": "Typology-Aware Curriculum Learning for Low-Resource Language Modeling",
        "Problem_Statement": "Standard LLM training pipelines do not prioritize or adapt dynamically to the typological characteristics of low-resource languages, limiting effective model learning and cross-lingual transfer.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap by designing typology-aware adaptive curriculum learning enabling targeted training schedules that reflect language-specific structural properties and data scarcity, integrating insights from opportunity 1 regarding reinforcement learning and distributed infrastructures.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Implement a scheduler that sequences training batches based on a language typological complexity score, progressively introducing languages from simpler to more complex typological profiles. Utilize a multitask LLM architecture with a specialized typology embedding module that conditions batch sampling. Training is distributed adaptively with deadlines optimized for computational load balancing.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Define typological complexity metrics from linguistic data. 2. Prepare multilingual corpora sorted by typological complexity. 3. Train LLMs with and without curriculum scheduler. 4. Benchmark on typology-sensitive tasks, including morphological prediction and syntactic parsing on low-resource languages. 5. Measure convergence speed, accuracy, and representation fairness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Morphologically rich language like Inuktitut. Expected Output: Improved morphological generation and understanding compared to baseline LLMs trained without typological curriculum.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If curriculum scheduling slows convergence, experiment with partial curriculum schemes or metadata-augmented multitask learning without strict ordering."

        "title": "Fog-Cloud Cooperative Framework for Typologically Diverse LLM Training",
        "Problem_Statement": "Scalable training frameworks for typology-enriched LLMs face infrastructural bottlenecks and lack integration with distributed computing paradigms to handle diverse language data at scale.",
        "Motivation": "Seizes the hidden bridge between 'processing of text' and 'distributed computing' paradigms from the gap analysis to build a novel fog-cloud hybrid architecture specialized in typology-aware LLM training, addressing infrastructural and deadline constraints (opportunity 1).",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a distributed training system where typology-specific submodules are processed in local fog nodes close to language data sources, enabling low-latency preprocessing and typology feature extraction. Cloud nodes handle global model aggregation and reinforcement learning-driven scheduling for resource allocation respecting deadlines. The system dynamically shifts workloads to optimize training efficiency and diversity representation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Prototype fog nodes with typology-aware feature extractors for a set of low-resource languages. 2. Integrate with cloud-based parameter server architecture. 3. Run timing, throughput, and model quality benchmarks comparing centralized vs fog-cloud setups. 4. Evaluate language representation improvement on downstream multilingual tasks.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Text datasets in Navajo and Xhosa distributed across fog nodes in respective geographies; Expected Output: Efficient parallel processing and typology-sensitive model updates maintaining training deadlines.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If distributed scheduling is complex, begin with hybrid batch processing splitting based on language typology. Use simulation to ease deployment challenges."
