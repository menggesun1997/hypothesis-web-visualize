    "title": "Edge-Enabled Adaptive Compression for Real-Time Privacy-Preserving LLM Inference in Low-Resource Languages",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing adaptive compression privacy techniques lack deployment feasibility in low-resource language settings with limited connectivity, preventing real-time, privacy-preserving LLM inference on edge devices in healthcare.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap revealing a lack of integration between adaptive compressed privacy methods and edge/device shadow technologies in resource-constrained settings, aiming for decentralized privacy-aware LLM usage directly on patient devices.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a lightweight edge inference pipeline using compressed LLM submodules dynamically activated based on linguistic complexity and privacy sensitivity of input. Incorporate device shadow states to synchronize context securely with cloud models without sharing raw sensitive data. Utilize token-level privacy scoring to adjust compression and inference pathways in real time, enabling low-latency responses in languages like Urdu.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop token privacy scoring metrics for Urdu telehealth inputs. 2. Build edge deployment of compressed LLM modules using pruning and quantization. 3. Integrate device shadow simulation to secure context sync. 4. Benchmark latency, privacy leakage (via membership inference tests), and accuracy against cloud-only baselines. 5. Test robustness under variable connectivity scenarios.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient's vocal Urdu health query preprocessed and tokenized locally. Expected output: Fast, privacy-preserving medically accurate response generated locally or with minimal cloud interaction, preserving data confidentiality.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If edge hardware constraints are critical, shift to hybrid on-device/cloud split inference with encrypted data transfer; if token privacy scoring underperforms, incorporate differential privacy noise mechanisms."

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experimental plan lacks detail on validating and quantifying the token-level privacy scoring metric's effectiveness, which is critical as it underpins the adaptive compression strategy. Defining clear criteria for privacy sensitivity and linguistic complexity, along with benchmarks or datasets for low-resource languages like Urdu, is essential. Additionally, simulating device shadow states for secure context synchronization needs a more concrete technical approach and evaluation metrics. To ensure feasibility, I recommend including development of motivated proxy datasets, ablation studies on compression-privacy trade-offs, and a clear protocol for robustness tests under realistic connectivity scenarios within the plan. This will strengthen confidence that the proposed method can successfully balance privacy, latency, and accuracy in low-resource edge deployments, particularly in telehealth settings where stakes are high and resources limited. Consider also evaluating energy consumption and hardware constraints explicitly for edge devices to verify practicality beyond latency and accuracy metrics alone in realistic conditions (e.g., common edge processors). This would demonstrate thorough feasibility assessment across system dimensions critical for deployment in resource-constrained environments and healthcare contexts in particular, thus preventing downstream surprises that could derail deployment feasibility despite conceptual novelty or good intentions in method design and evaluation planning as currently outlined in the proposal's Experiment_Plan section. \n\nRecommendation: Expand the experimental plan with concrete dataset/resource details, quantitative metrics for privacy scoring, detailed simulation setup for device shadow, inclusion of hardware constraints and efficiency metrics, and more granular latency/accuracy trade-off analysis to robustly validate feasibility assumptions explicit in the proposal's motivation and methods sections. This is vital for the idea to move beyond high-level conceptual novelty into demonstrable system feasibility, especially given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty pre-screening and high stakes of medical data privacy and real-time edge inference requirements outlined in the Problem_Statement and Motivation sections of the proposal. This targeted improvement will substantially de-risk the proposed deployment approach and strengthen sound feasibility claims typical of a premier ACL or NeurIPS conference paper's posture in privacy-preserving adaptive compressed edge LLM inference research challenging low-resource telehealth applications currently under-served and highly constrained by connectivity, privacy, and hardware at the patient device level as claimed in the submission. \n\nIn summary: Make experimental plan details explicit, closely integrated with privacy metric validation, simulation fidelity for device shadow synchrony, and hardware-aware feasibility to elevate the proposal's rigor and credibility in feasibility dimension beyond its current abstract description within Experiment_Plan, Proposed_Method, and Problem_Statement sections. This strengthens the foundation of sound execution feasibility needed for acceptance and impactful real-world adoption.\n\n\n---\n\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty classification and the proposal's core focus on adaptive compression and privacy preservation on edge devices in low-resource languages for LLM inference, I recommend integrating federated learning with differential privacy techniques into the design. Specifically, incorporating federated learning can allow decentralized training or continual adaptation of the compressed LLM submodules directly on patient devices (or a cohort of devices), leveraging patient data locally while maintaining privacy, enhancing model robustness and personalization in resource-scarce languages such as Urdu. Coupling this with differential privacy mechanisms—already suggested as a fallback but here elevated as an integral component—can rigorously quantify and guarantee privacy-utility trade-offs during both training and inference phases. This integration addresses novelty by harmonizing edge-device adaptive compression with state-of-the-art privacy-preserving decentralized learning schemes, leveraging growing momentum in federated learning's application for medical NLP and privacy protection. Moreover, such a combination can improve impact by enabling scalable, privacy-ensured model updates sensitive to user data heterogeneity common in healthcare telehealth scenarios, while potentially mitigating the need for frequent cloud interaction. I also suggest exploring knowledge distillation to create lightweight, compressed student models tailored for edge deployment enhanced by this federated pipeline, potentially boosting inference efficiency and privacy protection simultaneously. Overall, embedding federated learning and differential privacy into the adaptive compression edge inference framework can significantly boost competitiveness, novelty, and breadth of impact as linked concepts relevant to the proposal's domain indicate. This would make the approach more robust, explainable, and aligned with cutting-edge privacy preserving AI trends required for premier conferences and real world data-sensitive telemedical LLM applications in low-resource linguistic environments, thus elevating the proposal's standing within the research community and practical deployment considerations. Please consider expanding the Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan sections accordingly to incorporate these synergies with appropriate evaluation metrics and system integration details to fully realize potential gains in novelty and impact beyond current state of the art described. This helps transform a novel method combination into a more comprehensive, forward-looking privacy-preserving edge LLM framework bridging key gaps identified in the Motivation and Problem_Statement sections, strongly aligned with relevant globally linked concepts enumerated in the assignment prompt."
