        "title": "Resource-Aware Federated Neural Architecture Search Integrating Multimodal and Domain-Specific Pre-training for Multilingual Biomedical Foundation Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "Federated adaptation of foundation models for multilingual biomedical data faces significant challenges including heterogeneous client device capabilities, privacy constraints, communication bottlenecks, and convergence difficulties in neural architecture search (NAS) within realistic, resource-constrained, and privacy-sensitive federated environments. Existing approaches insufficiently address simultaneous architectural optimization across multiple biomedical modalities and languages under these complex constraints.",
        "Motivation": "While federated learning (FL) and neural architecture search (NAS) have been explored independently, few studies integrate resource-aware NAS frameworks tailored for multilingual biomedical data under real federated constraints. Furthermore, current methods rarely exploit domain-specific pre-training or multimodal biomedical data fusion within FL-NAS, limiting both novelty and practical utility. This proposal aims to bridge these gaps by leveraging domain-specific biomedical text embeddings and incorporating multimodal signals (e.g., electronic health records and retinal nerve fiber layer images) into a unified federated NAS framework that pragmatically addresses device heterogeneity, communication efficiency, privacy preservation, and NAS convergence challenges. This integration enhances both scientific novelty and healthcare impact, providing scalable, lightweight, and accurate multilingual biomedical foundation models for clinical NLP and vision tasks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a comprehensive resource-aware federated neural architecture search framework that jointly optimizes heterogeneous client-specific subnetworks for multilingual biomedical data encompassing text and medical images. Key components include: (1) integrating pre-trained domain-specific biomedical text embeddings (e.g., from transformer-based models) into the NAS search space to accelerate convergence and improve downstream clinical NLP accuracy; (2) supporting multimodal learning by enabling joint architecture adaptation across clinical text (e.g., electronic health records) and retinal nerve fiber layer images within federated clients; (3) incorporating adaptive search strategies that dynamically balance privacy constraints (using differential privacy techniques), communication budgets, and latency by profiling client capabilities in realistic federated simulations; (4) leveraging lightweight graph neural network modules to model biomedical entity relationships during NAS; (5) implementing simulation suites replicating heterogeneous federated environments with diverse device profiles, network conditions, and language-resource disparities; and (6) employing early stopping and progressive search space pruning to ensure NAS efficiency and robust convergence under resource limitations. This method aims to generate compact, client-specific models with optimal trade-offs between accuracy, latency, privacy, and communication overhead suitable for sensitive biomedical scenarios.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect and preprocess multilingual biomedical datasets covering low- to high-resource languages, incorporating diverse modalities: electronic health records (text) in English, Swahili, Urdu, and retinal nerve fiber layer images linked to ocular health conditions.\n2. Develop federated simulation environments reflecting realistic client heterogeneity: variable compute capabilities, network latencies, bandwidth constraints, and privacy policies.\n3. Integrate domain-specific pre-trained biomedical text embeddings into the NAS search space; implement multimodal fusion layers enabling joint optimization.\n4. Conduct federated NAS runs with adaptive search strategies balancing privacy budgets (e.g., differential privacy noise scales), communication overhead (measured as total bytes exchanged), and latency (measured at client-side inference times).\n5. Evaluate discovered architectures against static large foundation models on downstream clinical NLP tasks (e.g., Named Entity Recognition, paraphrase detection) and medical imaging tasks (e.g., automated depression detection via retinal images).\n6. Measure metrics dynamically during NAS: model size, client-side latency, communication load, clinical task accuracy, and privacy leakage risk.\n7. Validate NAS convergence and robustness across simulation scenarios; analyze trade-offs and interpret model adaptations to client heterogeneity.\n8. Perform ablation studies isolating effects of multimodal learning and domain-specific pre-training within federated NAS.\n9. Release benchmark setup and code for replicability and extensibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clients with heterogeneous devices hold electronic health records datasets in Swahili, English, and Urdu alongside corresponding retinal nerve fiber layer images. Output: Federated NAS returns compact, modality-adaptive client-specific architectures achieving comparable or superior accuracy on biomedical NLP and imaging clinical tasks with at least 50% reduction in communication overhead and latency relative to static large foundation models, while preserving rigorous privacy guarantees.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated NAS convergence faces challenges despite adaptive strategies, implement proxy federated environments with synthetic workloads to further prune NAS search space focusing on proven subnetwork modules. Alternatively, fix multimodal architecture backbones while optimizing only modality-specific heads. If domain-specific pre-training integration delays training undesirably, employ lightweight embedding distillation or parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Should privacy constraints bottleneck communication overhead excessively, selectively relax privacy budgets per modality or employ compressed model updates (e.g., quantization and sparsification). These pragmatic adjustments maintain feasibility and empirical rigor while preserving core multilingual federated NAS goals in biomedical contexts."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan outlines evaluation on multilingual biomedical NLP datasets from low- to high-resource languages, comparing NAS-optimized architectures against static foundation models. However, it lacks detail on addressing the inherent challenges of federated neural architecture search (NAS) convergence in realistic, heterogeneous federated environments with highly variable client capabilities and network conditions. Specifically, it does not clarify how privacy constraints and communication limitations will be balanced during the search process or how the search efficiency will be ensured in resource-constrained settings. Strengthening this section with more explicit protocols, simulation or real federated environment details, and fallback mechanisms beyond just reducing search space dimension is essential to establish the feasibility and robustness of the experiment plan in practice, particularly for sensitive biomedical data across diverse language groups with limited resources and varying device profiles. This detail is critical for reviewers and stakeholders to trust the practical viability of the approach under real-world constraints, which are often more complex than assumed in preliminary designs! Furthermore, clarifying how latency and communication overhead metrics will be measured dynamically during NAS would improve the practicality and replicability of the experiments. Without these clarifications, the experiment plan risks appearing overly idealized and underprepared for concrete implementation challenges, potentially undermining the proposal’s feasibility claims. Therefore, the experiment plan should explicitly incorporate realistic federated simulation protocols, adaptive search strategies, and detailed evaluation methodologies to guarantee sound scientific validation of the proposed method's practicality and effectiveness in federated biomedical NLP contexts across languages and resource profiles.  Please elaborate accordingly in your next iteration to ensure strong feasibility evidence and realistic experimentation protocols to fully convince reviewers of the method's viability in real-world federated biomedical NLP setups across languages and devices with constrained resources and privacy requirements.  Thank you!  This is a critical point needing thorough attention to confidently move forward with the work and its eventual impact potential!  Cheers!  — Reviewer AC #1 — \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment highlights this idea as [NOV-COMPETITIVE] in a highly active space integrating federated learning, neural architecture search, and multilingual biomedical modeling, a strategic enhancement could be to integrate domain-specific pre-training or multimodal learning elements into the federated NAS framework. For example, leveraging pre-trained biomedical text embedding models in the NAS search space could accelerate architecture adaptation and improve downstream clinical NLP accuracy without substantially increasing client computation. Alternatively, incorporating multimodal data such as clinical text and retinal nerve fiber layer images or other biomedical signals into a federated NAS setting could differentiate this work by exploring joint architecture optimization across heterogeneous modalities under resource constraints, thus broadening impact beyond pure text-based NLP. This integration would not only increase novelty by bridging currently separate research streams (domain-specific pre-training, multimodal learning, federated NAS) but also enhance real-world healthcare relevance and applicability. Given the biomedical focus and the presence of globally-linked concepts like domain-specific pre-training, retinal nerve fiber layer, and visual question answering, I strongly suggest investigating how these complementary modalities or embeddings can be incorporated into your federated NAS pipeline. Doing so can elevate the proposal's competitive edge, expand scientific contributions, and improve adoption potential in diverse healthcare AI scenarios requiring privacy, multilingual support, and multimodal understanding. In sum, take advantage of global linked concepts by extending your federated NAS approach with domain-specific pre-training and/or multimodal learning components, synthesizing recent advances to create a uniquely valuable and impactful resource-aware multilingual federated biomedical foundation modeling framework. This would greatly strengthen both novelty and downstream impact, efficiently leveraging current best practices and emerging trends in AI for healthcare. Thank you! — Reviewer AC #1 —"
