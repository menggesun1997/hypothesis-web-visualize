    "title": "Multi-Modal Privacy-Aware Federated LLM Framework for Culturally Tailored Health Communication",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a gap in frameworks that integrate multimodal linguistic data (text, voice) from culturally diverse populations securely into LLM training while preserving privacy and localization in healthcare delivery.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the internal gap on real-world validation of privacy-preserving methods beyond text-only datasets, focusing on cross-modal, culturally tailored datasets; bridges gaps in telemedicine multilingual data collection and privacy.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a federated learning pipeline where multi-modal data (spoken Urdu, written health notes) are locally preprocessed to extract linguistic features and anonymized embeddings, encrypted for secure aggregation. The LLM fine-tuning adapts to each modality distinctly with privacy budgets controlling contribution per participant. Incorporate culturally relevant prompts via participatory design.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multimodal datasets from Urdu-speaking patients (audio + text). 2. Implement on-device pre-processing pipelines for anonymization. 3. Train federated LLMs with privacy budgets. 4. Measure downstream health dialog task accuracy, privacy leakage, and cross-modal coherence. 5. Compare to centralized and unimodal training baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient query recorded via voice in Urdu along with typed health history. Expected output: Accurate multi-modal response supporting clinical decision with zero recovery of raw identifiable data.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated learning multi-modal fusion is unstable, separately train modality-specific sub-models with ensemble fusion; if privacy budget constraints reduce accuracy excessively, explore adaptive privacy budget allocation per modality."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a federated learning pipeline combining multi-modal data with privacy budgets and participatory design. However, the core mechanism of how modality-specific fine-tuning integrates with federated aggregation and privacy controls remains vague. Clarify how the privacy budget is allocated across modalities, how anonymized embeddings preserve clinical utility without leaking sensitive info, and the technical flow from local preprocessing to global LLM updates. Providing a detailed architecture diagram or pseudo-code will strengthen soundness and reproducibility evaluation. Address potential challenges like voice-text feature alignment and modality fusion within federated constraints explicitly in the proposal to validate feasibility assumptions more robustly while ensuring privacy guarantees are upheld effectively at scale and in heterogeneous cultural settings. This clarity is vital to justify the approach's technical soundness beyond conceptual novelty and determine precise risk-benefit tradeoffs, which are critical here due to health data sensitivity and multi-modal complexity involved in federated LLM adaptation for telemedicine contexts to diverse patient populations such as Urdu speakers with cultural tailoring requirements now described at a high level only but needing concrete mechanistic explication for peer validation and impact assessment accuracy confirmation on downstream clinical tasks under privacy constraints. Recommending elaboration on the exact federated learning model architecture, privacy-preserving transformation methods, and modality fusion techniques as concrete method descriptions in the updated proposal document is necessary to elevate the study from a promising conceptual framework to a fully vetted scientific method with adequate technical rigor for implementation and community replication attempts at a premier conference standard level. See this as critical for validating the study's internal logic consistency, methodological rigor, and also safeguarding patient data trustworthiness during experimentation and real-world deployment phases envisaged in the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan and Test_Case_Examples sections, as insufficient detail here could undermine feasibility judgments and potential real-world translational success despite the innovative idea locus in a highly competitive research landscape where many works exist on federated and privacy-preserving LLM training but rarely for multi-modal culturally localized telemedicine applications incorporating participatory design, making explicit the method's novelty and concrete soundness fundamentals paramount for credibility and impact evaluations here, to retain the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty forecast and avoid rejection on technical grounds despite a timely and socially valuable research topic being tackled comprehensively otherwise but only superficially specified methodologically presently in the proposal."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan proposes multimodal Urdu patient data collection, local anonymization, federated training with privacy budgets, and evaluation against centralized and unimodal baselines. However, it lacks concrete operational details critical for feasibility, such as specifics on patient recruitment strategy respecting cultural ethics, data quantity and diversity needed for robust model training, practical limitations of on-device preprocessing capabilities (especially for potentially computationally intensive anonymization and embedding extraction on resource-constrained devices common in targeted demographics), and precise metrics and methodologies for privacy leakage assessment. It is important to specify the secure aggregation protocols envisaged, communication overheads, potential data heterogeneity effects, and failure recovery mechanisms in federated learning scenarios expected. Also, how the participatory design will concretely influence prompt engineering or cultural tailoring and how these will be quantitatively measured or benchmarked should be detailed to ensure scientific rigor and reproducibility. These clarifications are essential to confirm the plan's scientific robustness, technological feasibility, and ethical robustness, particularly considering patient privacy in health data contexts and resource variability in Urdu-speaking telemedicine users. Without these, the experiment plan risks being overly optimistic or underspecified, threatening both implementation success and the validity of impact claims. Adding a timeline, projected resource needs, and fallback experimental setups with predefined evaluation criteria for precision, recall, privacy leak rates, and user acceptability in culturally tailored health communication scenarios will better scaffold feasibility and increase confidence in the practical viability of the framework with realistic constraints."
