        "title": "Federated Cross-Lingual Adapter Fusion for Biomedical LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Decentralized training of foundation language models (FMs) on biomedical data faces severe challenges managing high linguistic diversity across clients, limiting performance due to linguistic heterogeneity and data privacy constraints.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the gap of limited exploration of cross-lingual transfer in federated learning setups identified in the map, integrating a 'hidden bridge' from multilingual NLP to enable linguistically-aware adaptation in FL systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a federated adapter fusion framework where each client trains lightweight, language-specific adapters integrated into a shared FM backbone. On the server, adapters are aggregated via a multi-headed attention fusion enabling cross-lingual knowledge sharing without exposing raw data. The method combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning with privacy preservation and linguistic personalization by dynamically weighting adapters per client.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Use multilingual biomedical corpora spanning multiple languages (e.g., English, Spanish, Amharic, Hindi). Employ LLaMa as the FM backbone. Baselines include standard FL fine-tuning and multilingual centralized fine-tuning. Evaluate with clinical NER, relation extraction, and diagnosis prediction using metrics like F1 and accuracy; assess communication efficiency and privacy leakage through membership inference attacks.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient clinical notes in Amharic describing symptoms; Expected Output: Correctly extracted entities (disease, medication) and diagnosis prediction in the local language without data sharing.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If adapter fusion hampers convergence, alternatively explore meta-learning techniques for rapid cross-lingual adaptation in FL. Incorporate personalized FL approaches with local language embeddings as backup."

        "title": "Communication-Efficient Federated Pruning with Linguistic Diversity Awareness",
        "Problem_Statement": "Federated learning with large foundation models suffers from high communication overhead and inefficient scaling, especially in linguistically diverse biomedical domains with heterogeneous data distributions.",
        "Motivation": "Targets internal gaps regarding communication efficiency and lack of resource-aware model compression combined with linguistic adaptation per the landscape map's highlighted opportunities and hidden bridges from model pruning research.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a federated pruning protocol that dynamically prunes model parameters on clients guided by local language domain importance scores. Clients prune layers or neurons less relevant to their local linguistics and only communicate the compressed updates. The server reconstructs a consensus model via an adaptive weighted aggregation that respects linguistic diversity importance.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Employ multilingual biomedical datasets such as MIMIC/clinical text in different languages. Start from a large LLaMa variant. Baselines include vanilla FL and existing pruning methods without linguistic awareness. Metrics focus on communication cost reduction, model accuracy on downstream tasks, and fairness across language groups.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Spanish radiology report dataset; Expected Output: A pruned model update reducing communication size by 70% without accuracy drop in named entity recognition compared to full model.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If linguistically-aware pruning harms model utility, revert to structured pruning guided by client compute constraints only; or incorporate quantization as backup compression."

        "title": "Privacy-Driven Continual Federated Learning with Language-Specific Regularization",
        "Problem_Statement": "Personalized model adaptation in federated learning for languages with scarce biomedical data is unaddressed, risking poor model generalization and privacy leakage during continuous updates.",
        "Motivation": "Bridges external gaps combining privacy-enhanced continual learning with FL, addressing personalization and linguistic diversity as highlighted in the innovation opportunities.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a continual federated learning system that integrates language-specific regularization terms preserving linguistic features while employing differential privacy noise injection per client. The system allows clients to adapt continually as new biomedical data arrives while safeguarding privacy and preventing catastrophic forgetting.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Use time-sequenced multilingual biomedical datasets simulating client data arrival. Evaluate continual NER and classification tasks, measuring accuracy over time, privacy budget consumption, and model stability. Compare to non-continual FL and non-private continual learners.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: New clinical notes in Thai arriving sequentially; Output: Updated client model improving NER performance without revealing prior data.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If privacy noise deteriorates model quality, tune privacy budget or adopt local replay buffers to reinforce forgetting prevention without breaching privacy."

        "title": "Multimodal Federated Language Adaptation with Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current FL approaches focus on unimodal biomedical data and ignore the challenge of adapting multilingual foundation models on diverse data modalities under privacy constraints.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses critical gap of lacking cross-modal adaptation methods in federated contexts, leveraging hidden bridges from multimodal distillation and cross-lingual transfer learning.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Propose a federated multimodal distillation framework where unimodal client models (text, image, signal) locally learn modality-specific representations and distill knowledge into a shared multilingual FM server model via encrypted soft-label transmissions. Language adaptation happens through auxiliary language embeddings fused with modality representations.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Collect paired multimodal biomedical datasets (clinical text, diagnostic images) across multiple languages. Use LLaMa variants augmented with modality encoders. Compare to unimodal FL baselines without distillation. Evaluate on cross-modal entity recognition and diagnosis support tasks, measuring privacy preservation and linguistic adaptation quality.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical text in French with corresponding X-ray images; Output: Federated model predicting diagnosis improved by cross-modal distillation respecting language diversity and data privacy.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If distillation is ineffective, explore hierarchical FL hierarchy separating modalities or fallback to modality-agnostic language adaptation."

        "title": "Neural Architecture Search for Resource-Aware Multilingual Federated Foundation Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "Federated adaptation of foundation models across linguistically diverse biomedical data is resource-intensive with limited exploration of architectural optimization in this space.",
        "Motivation": "Closes an external gap by integrating resource-aware NAS techniques with FL for multilingual biomedical models, targeting scalability and communication limits identified in the research landscape.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a federated neural architecture search framework that simultaneously optimizes model subnetworks tailored to individual language groups, constrained by client device capabilities and communication budgets. Search is privacy-aware and incentivizes lightweight architectures maintaining high biomedical NLP accuracy.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Use multilingual biomedical NLP datasets from low to high-resource languages. Compare architectures discovered via NAS-FL with static large FMs. Metrics include model size, latency, accuracy on clinical tasks, and communication overhead.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Electronic health record datasets in Swahili and English; Output: Compact client-specific model architectures delivering comparable accuracy with 50% less communication cost.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If NAS convergence fails under FL, reduce search space dimension or employ proxy tasks with simulated federated environments."
