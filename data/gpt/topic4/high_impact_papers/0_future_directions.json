        "title": "Sociocultural Bias Mapping in Underrepresented Language LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current bias evaluation frameworks for multilingual LLMs inadequately capture sociocultural contextual factors impacting language use in marginalized communities, leading to incomplete fairness assessments.",
        "Motivation": "This project addresses the critical gap of integrating social contextual data from marginalized language communities (social networks) and socioeconomic factors (public health, migration, social capital) to create a comprehensive bias evaluation framework, as suggested by Opportunity 1.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel bias evaluation framework named Sociocultural Bias Mapping (SBM) that leverages social network graphs of marginalized language speakers enriched with public health, migration, and socioeconomic data. The approach integrates social determinants into bias quantification by modeling language usage patterns influenced by these factors, using multi-modal embeddings combining textual, social, and socioeconomic signals. The framework outputs socioculturally contextual bias scores for LLM responses across underrepresented languages.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multilingual corpora from underrepresented languages alongside community social network data and public health/migration statistics.\n2. Construct joint embeddings integrating text with social/socioeconomic context.\n3. Adapt bias metrics to incorporate sociocultural embeddings.\n4. Benchmark against existing bias evaluation methods using multilingual LLMs like BLOOM.\n5. Evaluate improvements via fairness-aware metrics and community validation.\n6. Perform ablation studies to isolate contribution of social and health data.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt a sentiment analysis task in Tamil within context of a migrant worker community.\nExpected Output: Bias evaluation score revealing reduced negativity bias in model outputs when sociocultural context is integrated, reflecting more accurate sentiment representation respecting local norms.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If socioeconomic data integration proves noisy or unavailable, fallback to synthetic social graph augmentation based on linguistic community metadata. Alternatively, employ unsupervised social context inference from longitudinal social media data to approximate social determinants."

        "title": "Cultural Heritage Knowledge Graphs for Low-Resource Language Dataset Enrichment",
        "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource language datasets suffer from scarcity and lack cultural contextualization, leading to poor LLM generalization and evaluation in these languages.",
        "Motivation": "This addresses the external gap of underutilized digital humanities resources by combining cultural heritage knowledge graphs with corpus linguistics to create richer, ethically curated datasets, responding to Opportunity 2's call.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct interconnected cultural heritage knowledge graphs (KGs) for underrepresented languages using digital humanities sources (manuscripts, oral histories, art metadata). Link KGs to linguistic corpora to generate culturally contextualized synthetic data via KG-driven data augmentation. Incorporate ethical curation protocols from humanities scholarship. The resulting datasets provide training and evaluation resources reflecting authentic cultural semantics and narratives.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Extract cultural heritage entities and relations from digital humanities archives for target languages.\n2. Build and validate multilingual cultural heritage KGs.\n3. Develop augmentation algorithms to synthesize text segments grounded in KG facts/narratives.\n4. Combine augmented data with existing corpora.\n5. Train/evaluate LLMs on enriched datasets, comparing against baseline corpora.\n6. Assess gains in cultural representativeness and bias mitigation via qualitative and quantitative analyses.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Sample Input: Generate story snippets in Quechua incorporating traditional myths from KG.\nExpected Output: Texts that faithfully embed mythological elements with correct cultural semantics, enhancing LLM authenticity and evaluation for Quechua.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If KG extraction is incomplete, fallback to manual expert curation for seed cultural concepts. Alternatively, use cross-lingual transfer learning from better-resourced related languages to supplement data."

        "title": "Ethical and Impact-Sensitive Multilingual LLM Evaluation Pipeline",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing multilingual LLM evaluation pipelines lack integration of ethical considerations and societal impact assessments, particularly for languages marginalized in AI governance frameworks.",
        "Motivation": "Responding to Opportunity 3, this project fills the novel gap linking ethical AI with digital health and policy frameworks by embedding humanities-driven ethical evaluation into multilingual LLM assessment.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an evaluation pipeline embedding multi-dimensional ethical metrics including fairness, health literacy impact, and compliance with emerging AI regulatory frameworks (e.g., AI Act). The pipeline leverages interdisciplinary input from digital humanities, legal studies, and public health experts to interpret LLM outputs in diverse languages and contexts. It incorporates domain-specific tests such as mental health chatbot interactions and policy-sensitive text generation, generating transparent ethical evaluation reports.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Define ethical evaluation criteria guided by humanities and legal scholars.\n2. Assemble evaluation datasets spanning health literacy, mental health dialogue, and policy texts in underrepresented languages.\n3. Develop metrics capturing fairness, harm risk, transparency, and regulatory alignment.\n4. Implement multilingual LLM evaluation pipeline integrating these metrics.\n5. Test pipeline on existing LLMs and analyze output diversity and ethical risks.\n6. Collaborate with community stakeholders for validation and feedback.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Prompt: Generate mental health support message in Wolof for users with specific cultural idioms.\nExpected Output: A message demonstrating culturally sensitive, non-stigmatizing language, evaluated for ethical compliance and health literacy.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If comprehensive regulatory frameworks are unavailable, fallback on best-practice ethical guidelines from WHO and ethics boards. Alternatively, simplify pipeline to focus on fairness and harm reduction metrics initially."

        "title": "Multimodal Sociolinguistic Embeddings for Bias-Aware Multilingual Language Modeling",
        "Problem_Statement": "Bias evaluations on multilingual LLMs do not utilize multimodal social contextual signals, missing subtle sociolinguistic factors influencing language representation in underrepresented communities.",
        "Motivation": "This idea creatively synthesizes the critical gap linking social network analysis to bias origins by developing multimodal embeddings incorporating social graphs, text, and socioeconomic indicators, thus transforming bias evaluation into a richer, context-aware process.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a multimodal embedding architecture that fuses textual input from underrepresented languages with social network structures (e.g., community ties, influence), demographic, and socioeconomic data at individual and group levels. This embedding feeds into bias quantification modules that measure representational fairness with improved granularity. The model employs graph neural networks jointly trained with language representations to reflect real-world social dynamics.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect parallel textual and social network data (e.g., messaging apps, community forums) for selected marginalized languages.\n2. Preprocess and align data sources.\n3. Implement multimodal embedding model using transformers and GNNs.\n4. Develop bias detection metrics sensitive to social embedding features.\n5. Benchmark against traditional text-only bias metrics.\n6. Perform user studies assessing alignment with perceived bias in communities.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Textual prompt concerning employment opportunities in Xhosa community during economic downturn.\nExpected Output: Bias score indicating reduced economic stereotyping bias when social context embeddings are used.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If joint training is unstable, consider sequential training with modality-specific fine-tuning. Alternatively, leverage proxy social metrics derived from linguistic features alone if direct social data is limited."

        "title": "Public Health-Informed Language Model Fairness Assessment for Migrant Populations",
        "Problem_Statement": "Language models inadequately account for public health and migration-related social determinants affecting language use in migrant populations, resulting in biased or inappropriate outputs.",
        "Motivation": "This project targets the external gap revealed in the map by integrating public health and migration data with social network analysis to improve fairness evaluation for migrant language users, operationalizing Opportunity 1.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Build a fairness assessment framework tailored for migrant populations by mapping health literacy levels, migration patterns, and social capital metrics onto language data. Utilize statistical linkage of public health datasets with linguistic corpora and social network graphs. Adapt bias measurement metrics to weigh outputs against these sociocultural factors, creating fairness indices sensitive to migrant realities.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Gather linguistic data from migrant communities paired with public health and migration statistics.\n2. Construct linked datasets representing social determinants.\n3. Define fairness metrics adjusted for these linked factors.\n4. Evaluate multilingual LLM outputs across migrant languages.\n5. Validate results via feedback from migrant community representatives and public health experts.\n6. Iterate metric tuning to optimize fairness sensitivity.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example: Output of a LLM health information chatbot in Rohingya language, evaluated for accuracy and equity relative to migrants' health literacy and social support status.\nExpected Output: Fairness assessment report indicating alignment with migratory community needs and reduced health misinformation bias.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct migrant data access is restricted, use aggregated regional indicators and simulate scenarios with synthetic data. Incorporate domain adaptation techniques to approximate migrant-specific language use."
