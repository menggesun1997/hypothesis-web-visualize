    "title": "Cognitive Pragmatics Guided Semantic Fairness Metrics for Multilingual LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current bias evaluation metrics for multilingual LLMs fail to capture subtle semantic and cultural biases manifesting through pragmatic and cognitive language structures, particularly affecting underrepresented languages. This limits interpretability and comprehensiveness of fairness assessments.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal limitation of insufficient interpretability and subtle bias measurement (Critical Gap 1 and 2) by integrating cognitive architecture insights from cognitive psychology (Hidden Bridge from C) with multilingual evaluation methods (from B2). This novel semantic-pragmatic fairness metric aims to unveil biases beyond surface statistical parity, filling a gap overlooked by existing fairness frameworks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel fairness evaluation framework combining multilingual LLM outputs with cognitive pragmatic theory to model contextual, implicature, and culturally variable semantic nuances. The framework will embed cognitive pragmatic markers (e.g., speech acts, presuppositions, implicatures) as features for bias detection, leveraging multilingual corpora annotated for these pragmatic features. Metrics will quantify bias disparities in these pragmatic dimensions across languages. This involves building a cognitive-pragmatics-aware analysis pipeline integrated with existing benchmark suites and explainable AI techniques to enhance transparency and interpretability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate a multilingual corpus annotated with pragmatic phenomena and cultural context labels.\n2) Fine-tune multilingual LLMs with pragmatic annotations.\n3) Develop computational metrics extracting pragmatic bias indicators.\n4) Benchmark against existing bias metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds).\n5) Apply explainability methods to interpret pragmatic bias signals.\n6) Evaluate correlations with human judgments of fairness in multilingual contexts.\n7) Perform ablation studies on model components focusing on pragmatic semantic features.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A prompt in Swahili requesting a story about a nurse's role.\nOutput (biased model): The story implicitly associates nursing with women only.\nOutput (after evaluation and mitigation): The story fairly represents nurses of all genders.\nMetric insight: Pragmatic markers detect gender stereotyping in implied roles used in output narratives, quantifying bias reduction post mitigation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If pragmatics annotation proves too sparse, pivot to unsupervised clustering of usage patterns guided by cognitive linguistic theory to identify bias patterns. Also, consider expanding evaluation to dialogue contexts where pragmatic cues are richer and more apparent."

        "title": "Cognitive-Pragmatics and Ethically Informed Semantic Fairness Metrics for Multilingual LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current bias evaluation metrics for multilingual large language models (LLMs) inadequately capture subtle semantic, pragmatic, and culturally embedded biases—especially in underrepresented languages—due to limited resources for pragmatic annotation and lack of frameworks integrating cognitive, ethical, and psychometric dimensions. This gap constrains comprehensive interpretability and fairness assessment, hindering trustworthy deployment in multilingual contexts with diverse moral and cultural norms.",
        "Motivation": "Building on cognitive pragmatic theory and multilingual bias evaluation methods, this work addresses the limited interpretability and subtle bias detection (Critical Gaps 1 & 2) by integrating cognitive-pragmatic linguistic markers with psychometric and ethical theory. This fusion enriches fairness metrics by embedding moral competence and culturally grounded value systems, distinguishing our framework from prior approaches that focus on statistical parity or demographic fairness alone. By leveraging multilingual benchmark datasets annotated with ethical and moral dimensions and combining them with cognitive pragmatics, we create a novel, human-centered semantic fairness evaluation pipeline that advances fairness evaluation for multilingual LLMs in a deeper, ethically informed manner. This advancement positions our approach as both theoretically novel and practically impactful in multilingual natural language understanding and AI ethics.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We will develop an ethically informed cognitive-pragmatics-based fairness evaluation framework for multilingual LLMs that synergizes three components: (1) cognitive pragmatic markers capturing context-dependent semantic and pragmatic features (e.g., speech acts, implicatures, presuppositions), (2) psychometric measures of moral competence and value orientations derived from established inventories, and (3) integration of multilingual benchmark datasets annotated for moral and ethical language use. The framework involves: (a) curating and expanding multilingual corpora with pragmatic and ethical annotations using semi-supervised and cross-lingual transfer learning to mitigate annotation sparsity for underrepresented languages, (b) fine-tuning multilingual LLMs incorporating these enriched annotations with carefully designed training protocols to maintain generalization and avoid overfitting, and (c) formulating composite bias metrics that quantify disparities in pragmatic, ethical, and moral competence-relevant dimensions across languages. Explainable AI methods will interpret bias sources, linking model behavior with human ethical cognition. Early-stage unsupervised clustering and weak supervision techniques will supplement data scarcity, ensuring robustness. Evaluation benchmarks will explicitly consider resource availability scenarios to maintain feasibility across diverse language contexts, facilitating reproducible and practical deployment.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compile existing multilingual datasets with pragmatic, moral, and ethical annotations; augment these via semi-supervised learning and cross-lingual annotation projection to enhance coverage for low-resource languages, specifying target corpus sizes and language subsets to balance feasibility and impact.\n2) Design a unified annotation schema combining cognitive pragmatics features and ethical-psychometric dimensions, validated via expert review.\n3) Fine-tune multilingual LLMs on augmented datasets using protocol elements such as controlled learning rates, regularization, and multitask objectives to preserve generalization.\n4) Develop composite fairness metrics that integrate semantic-pragmatic bias indicators with moral competence alignment scores derived from psychometric modeling.\n5) Incorporate explainability methods (e.g., attention analysis, feature attribution) for interpretability of bias metrics.\n6) Benchmark models against standard bias metrics and newly developed ethical-pragmatic metrics, analyzing correlation with human fairness judgments across cultures.\n7) Execute ablation studies isolating cognitive pragmatic and ethical components, as well as controlled experiments adjusting data availability scenarios to validate robustness.\n8) Establish fallback workflows where unsupervised or weakly supervised clustering on usage patterns supplements pragmatic and ethical signals if annotations fall short early on.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A Swahili-language prompt requesting a story about a nurse's role.\nOutput (biased baseline): The narrative implicitly reinforces gender stereotypes by depicting nursing exclusively as women’s work.\nOutput (post mitigation): The story neutralizes gender roles, portraying nurses of diverse genders fairly and respectfully.\nMetric insight: Pragmatic markers reveal speech act framing and implicature biases related to gender; ethical-psychometric alignment metrics demonstrate improved moral competence conformity; explainability components pinpoint features responsible for bias shifts. This comprehensive evaluation quantifies reductions in both semantic-pragmatic and ethical biases, illustrating effectiveness across underrepresented languages.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "To address annotation scarcity and complexity, early pipeline stages will integrate unsupervised and weakly supervised clustering of linguistic usage patterns informed by cognitive linguistic theory and psychometric profiling, enabling detection of bias signals without heavy reliance on manual annotation. If pragmatic or ethical annotations prove unavailable for targeted languages, cross-lingual transfer learning and data augmentation from resource-rich languages will be employed. Should fine-tuning with pragmatic-ethical annotations risk overfitting or degrade generalization, multitask learning with auxiliary tasks and regularization techniques will be introduced. These fallback strategies are embedded from project inception, ensuring resilience against data and resource constraints and maintaining experimental progress until richer annotations can be incorporated."

          "feedback_content": "The Experiment Plan relies heavily on acquiring and curating a multilingual corpus richly annotated with pragmatic phenomena and cultural context labels—a task which is notoriously challenging due to sparse resources and annotation complexity across underrepresented languages. The proposal should better anticipate these data acquisition risks by elaborating fallback strategies at the data preparation stage, such as leveraging semi-supervised or cross-lingual transfer techniques to expand annotation coverage. Additionally, fine-tuning multilingual LLMs with such specialized pragmatic annotations might require careful protocol design to avoid overfitting or loss of generalization; this aspect needs more methodological detail to validate practicality and reproducibility. Clarifying annotation schema, expected corpus sizes, and resource needs would notably strengthen the feasibility argument, ensuring the ambitious evaluation pipeline can be successfully executed within typical project constraints and timelines, or alternatively adapt gracefully if scarce annotated data limits progress early on. Consider integrating unsupervised or weakly supervised learning signals earlier rather than as a fallback to increase robustness of the research plan under practical constraints, especially for underresourced languages where pragmatic annotations are minimal or unavailable. This will solidify confidence in the experimental viability of the approach beyond conceptual novelty and theoretical appeal, providing a realistic pathway to empirical validation and impact assessment in complex multilingual contexts where bias is subtle and manifests at pragmatic levels of discourse and cognition.  Overall, a tighter and more detailed feasibility analysis on the data and model adaptation steps is critical before proceeding further to avoid bottlenecks that could derail the project or hamper interpretability claims due to insufficient data support and model robustness challenges inherent in multilingual pragmatic bias evaluation contexts.  \n\nIn summary, please expand and concretize your experimental plan details focusing on annotation resource constraints, model fine-tuning strategies, and early incorporation of robust fallback or unsupervised mechanisms to enhance the practicality and scientific rigor of your methodology toward its goals in semantic fairness assessment of multilingual LLMs through cognitive pragmatics features integration.  \n\nThis clarification and detail will help avoid overoptimistic feasibility assumptions and inspire confidence that the idea is achievable with expected research resources and constraints in the complex, underexplored multilingual bias evaluation domain you target, thus firmly supporting the overall soundness and realizability of your contribution roadmap.  \n\nRecommended action: Add concrete annotation and data acquisition plans, define corpus sizes and language coverage goals, detail model training protocols and fallback unsupervised methods integration points early in the pipeline, and outline evaluation criteria linked to data and resource availability scenarios to strengthen feasibility foundation and mitigate critical execution risks early in your project timeline.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and the deep integration of cognitive pragmatics with multilingual bias evaluation, a promising avenue to enhance both impact and novelty is to integrate psychometric inventories and ethical theory into your framework. For example, align the pragmatic bias metrics with established psychometric measures of moral competence or value systems to ground fairness assessments in human ethical cognition dimensions. Such integration can enrich the semantic-pragmatic markers with human-centered value orientations, enabling more nuanced, morally informed bias evaluations that resonate with ethical theory and moral psychology. Further, leveraging multilingual benchmark datasets that annotate moral and ethical dimensions of language use could expand the framework’s applicability and the interpretability of fairness metrics beyond linguistic bias to also address ethical biases reflecting cultural value differences. Embedding this richer, ethically informed interpretive layer can position your work to contribute uniquely to the understanding of moral competence as it manifests in multilingual LLM outputs, thus better connecting cognitive pragmatics, multilingual natural language understanding, and ethical theory in an innovative way. This cross-disciplinary fusion would create a more comprehensive semantic fairness evaluation framework that directly speaks to real-world concerns about moral competence of AI systems, potentially influencing the design of future multilingual LLMs to be not only cognitively and pragmatically aware but also aligned with diverse ethical value systems across cultures. I encourage you to explore these globally linked concepts as a constructive direction to differentiate your work and broaden its foundational impact on fairness evaluation of multilingual language models in ways that exceed current metrics focused on statistical parity or demographic fairness alone."
