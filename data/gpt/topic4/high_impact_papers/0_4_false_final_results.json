    "title": "Public Health-Informed Language Model Fairness Assessment for Migrant Populations",
    "Problem_Statement": "Language models inadequately account for public health and migration-related social determinants affecting language use in migrant populations, resulting in biased or inappropriate outputs.",
    "Motivation": "This project targets the external gap revealed in the map by integrating public health and migration data with social network analysis to improve fairness evaluation for migrant language users, operationalizing Opportunity 1.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a fairness assessment framework tailored for migrant populations by mapping health literacy levels, migration patterns, and social capital metrics onto language data. Utilize statistical linkage of public health datasets with linguistic corpora and social network graphs. Adapt bias measurement metrics to weigh outputs against these sociocultural factors, creating fairness indices sensitive to migrant realities.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Gather linguistic data from migrant communities paired with public health and migration statistics.\n2. Construct linked datasets representing social determinants.\n3. Define fairness metrics adjusted for these linked factors.\n4. Evaluate multilingual LLM outputs across migrant languages.\n5. Validate results via feedback from migrant community representatives and public health experts.\n6. Iterate metric tuning to optimize fairness sensitivity.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Example: Output of a LLM health information chatbot in Rohingya language, evaluated for accuracy and equity relative to migrants' health literacy and social support status.\nExpected Output: Fairness assessment report indicating alignment with migratory community needs and reduced health misinformation bias.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct migrant data access is restricted, use aggregated regional indicators and simulate scenarios with synthetic data. Incorporate domain adaptation techniques to approximate migrant-specific language use."
