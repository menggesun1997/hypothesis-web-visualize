    "title": "Typology-Enhanced Visual-Linguistic LLM Training via Rhetorical Device Modeling",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM training methods often ignore the influence of rhetorical devices linked to linguistic typology and cognitive persuasion theories, limiting diversity representation and sociocultural contextualization.",
    "Motivation": "Exploits the hidden bridge between image processing and social psychology framed rhetorical devices to enrich LLM training by modeling rhetorical patterns typologically informed, addressing bias and enhancing nuanced sociolinguistic representation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a training paradigm incorporating rhetorical device detectors trained on multimodal document images capturing visual-textual cues (layout, typography, imagery) and language typological features. Use these detectors to annotate large corpora, then fine-tune LLMs with multi-task loss to jointly predict text and rhetorical device structures, enabling awareness of persuasive linguistic forms across diverse typologies and social contexts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Annotate multimodal datasets for rhetorical devices spanning typologically diverse languages. 2) Train detectors linking visual and linguistic features. 3) Fine-tune LLMs with combined language modeling and rhetorical device prediction objectives. 4) Evaluate on rhetorical device recognition, multilingual persuasion tasks, and bias reduction benchmarks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A political speech document image in a polysynthetic language with embedded metaphors and cultural rhetorical devices. Expected Output: LLM-generated summaries capturing rhetorical nuances and culturally sensitive language variation without stereotype reinforcement.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "Should joint training underperform, isolate rhetorical device modeling as a preprocessing step feeding enhanced embeddings to standard LLM fine-tuning pipelines."

        "title": "Typology-Enhanced Visual-Linguistic LLM Training via Rhetorical Device Modeling for Multicultural and Educational Impact",
        "Problem_Statement": "Contemporary large language model (LLM) training approaches inadequately capture the complex interplay of rhetorical devices informed by linguistic typology, cognitive persuasion theories, and sociocultural contexts, which constrains representational diversity, cultural sensitivity, and limits applications in heritage language preservation and educational settings.",
        "Motivation": "Building on a NOV-COMPETITIVE foundation, this research innovatively bridges multimodal processing, linguistic typology, and social psychology by integrating rhetorical device modeling with cultural heritage preservation and automated essay evaluation domains. By explicitly representing typological and cognitive features alongside visual-textual cues, the approach transcends current mono- and bi-modal methods. This facilitates nuanced sociolinguistic and persuasive expression modeling, reduces bias, and supports downstream applications in heritage language maintenance and formative language education, thus addressing pressing societal and linguistic diversity challenges while enhancing novelty and impact.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel, theoretically grounded multi-stage framework that fuses multimodal signals (document image layout, typography, imagery), linguistic typological metadata, and cognitive persuasion constructs through a transparent modular architecture:\n\n1. **Typological Feature Representation and Integration:** Linguistic typology features (e.g., morphological complexity, syntactic order, discourse markers) will be encoded as structured metadata vectors per language, derived from typological databases like WALS. These vectors are embedded and concatenated with visual feature embeddings extracted via CNNs from document images.\n\n2. **Multimodal Rhetorical Device Detector Architecture:** Utilizing a multi-branch neural network, one branch processes visual-textual embeddings (layout, font, images) via CNN-transformer hybrids, while a parallel branch incorporates typological embeddings through cross-attention mechanisms. This fusion maps to rhetorical device categories informed by cognitive persuasion theories (e.g., ethos, pathos, logos) operationalized as classification and span detection tasks.\n\n3. **Pilot Validation and Hypotheses:** We will conduct preliminary experiments on pilot multilingual multimodal corpora annotated for rhetorical devices across typologies to validate detector feasibility, assessing precision, recall, and cross-linguistic generalizability.\n\n4. **Integrated LLM Fine-tuning via Multi-task Learning:** Rhetorical device detector outputs, combined with typological metadata, form enhanced input embeddings fed into the LLM. A joint multi-task loss trains the model to predict next tokens and rhetorical structures concurrently, enabling LLMs to internalize persuasive constructs aligned with language-specific typological nuances.\n\n5. **Global Integration with Corpus Linguistics & Educational Applications:** Leveraging culturally rich, annotated corpora from corpus linguistics and cultural heritage initiatives supports robust sociocultural representation. Downstream, we design evaluation tasks in automated essay evaluation and heritage language education contexts, enabling formative feedback on rhetorical skill and cultural appropriateness.\n\nThis design clarifies methodological mechanisms, grounds the approach in cognitive and linguistic theory, and innovatively integrates globally linked concepts, maximizing novelty, feasibility, and societal relevance.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate and annotate a multilingual multimodal dataset incorporating document images from culturally diverse sources, emphasizing typological and rhetorical device labels coordinated with corpus linguistics and heritage preservation experts.\n2) Construct typological feature embeddings from reputable linguistic databases and integrate these into detector model inputs.\n3) Develop and train the multi-branch rhetorical device detector network, rigorously validating modality fusion strategies and cross-linguistic performance.\n4) Perform pilot studies evaluating detector accuracy and analyze cognitive persuasion mapping consistency.\n5) Fine-tune an LLM (e.g., multilingual transformer-based) using a multi-task loss combining language modeling and rhetorical device prediction.\n6) Establish evaluation protocols on rhetorical device recognition, bias mitigation, multilingual persuasion generation, and applications in automated essay evaluation and heritage language teaching.\n7) Analyze results to iteratively refine model architectures and fusion techniques, publishing resources and tools for the research and educational community.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A scanned political speech document image in a polysynthetic heritage language containing culturally embedded metaphors, idiomatic expressions, and rhetorical appeals framed by cognitive persuasion categories.\nExpected Output: (1) Accurate identification and classification of rhetorical devices aligned with the languageâ€™s typological traits.\n(2) An LLM-generated summary conveying nuanced persuasive strategies and culturally sensitive expression without perpetuating stereotypes.\n(3) Automated essay evaluation style feedback highlighting rhetorical effectiveness and culturally appropriate language use, useful for heritage language learners.\nExample: Given a Yupik language campaign flyer image embedding pathos through vivid imagery and culturally salient metaphor, the model annotates these devices and generates a persuasive summary considerate of local discourse norms.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If joint multi-task training proves impractical or yields suboptimal performance, the methodology will pivot to treat rhetorical device modeling as an explicit preprocessing module. Detectors will generate enriched embeddings or annotations infused with typological metadata to augment input representations for standard LLM fine-tuning pipelines. Additionally, auxiliary datasets from educational and heritage language contexts will be leveraged to retrain and calibrate detectors independently. This modular approach maintains the core innovation while reducing joint training complexity and facilitating iterative integration."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a multi-modal approach incorporating visual and linguistic features to detect rhetorical devices and integrate them into LLM training via a multi-task loss. However, the mechanism lacks clarity in several respects: (1) how exactly typological features from diverse languages will be represented and incorporated jointly with visual cues; (2) the feasibility of training reliable multimodal rhetorical device detectors given the complexity and cultural specificity of rhetorical devices; and (3) how persuasive cognitive theories concretely map onto model architectures or learning objectives. To improve soundness, clarify the model architectures, feature fusion strategies, and provide preliminary hypotheses or pilot results demonstrating detector effectiveness across typologies and modalities. Explicitly specify how multimodal signals and typological metadata are fused and utilized in fine-tuning the LLM to ensure the claims are mechanistically plausible and well-founded. This clarification is essential before committing to the complex multi-modal multi-task training paradigm proposed. Targeting this will strengthen the method's theoretical grounding and convince reviewers of its internal coherence and viability within the competitive area noted in the novelty assessment, reducing risk of unclear or impractical methodology critiques."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the interdisciplinary nature of the research idea, integrating insights and resources from linked global concepts could significantly enhance impact and differentiation. Specifically, leveraging \"corpus linguistics\" and \"cultural heritage preservation\" can provide rich, diverse, and well-annotated multilingual corpora imbued with sociocultural nuances and rhetorical markers. Further, connecting with \"automated essay evaluation\" and \"enhance educational practices\" domains can expand downstream applications beyond summarization into formative assessment and language education, especially for minority or heritage language contexts. This integration would broaden the scope of impact, introduce new evaluation scenarios, and position the work as a bridge between NLP, language education, and cultural preservation, thus elevating its novelty and societal relevance. To implement, the authors could seek partnerships with corpora and educational datasets explicitly annotated for rhetorical and cultural features and propose evaluation tasks aligned with educational and heritage preservation goals alongside current persuasion and bias benchmarks."
