    "title": "Sociocultural Bias Mapping in Underrepresented Language LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current bias evaluation frameworks for multilingual LLMs inadequately capture sociocultural contextual factors impacting language use in marginalized communities, leading to incomplete fairness assessments.",
    "Motivation": "This project addresses the critical gap of integrating social contextual data from marginalized language communities (social networks) and socioeconomic factors (public health, migration, social capital) to create a comprehensive bias evaluation framework, as suggested by Opportunity 1.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel bias evaluation framework named Sociocultural Bias Mapping (SBM) that leverages social network graphs of marginalized language speakers enriched with public health, migration, and socioeconomic data. The approach integrates social determinants into bias quantification by modeling language usage patterns influenced by these factors, using multi-modal embeddings combining textual, social, and socioeconomic signals. The framework outputs socioculturally contextual bias scores for LLM responses across underrepresented languages.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multilingual corpora from underrepresented languages alongside community social network data and public health/migration statistics.\n2. Construct joint embeddings integrating text with social/socioeconomic context.\n3. Adapt bias metrics to incorporate sociocultural embeddings.\n4. Benchmark against existing bias evaluation methods using multilingual LLMs like BLOOM.\n5. Evaluate improvements via fairness-aware metrics and community validation.\n6. Perform ablation studies to isolate contribution of social and health data.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt a sentiment analysis task in Tamil within context of a migrant worker community.\nExpected Output: Bias evaluation score revealing reduced negativity bias in model outputs when sociocultural context is integrated, reflecting more accurate sentiment representation respecting local norms.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If socioeconomic data integration proves noisy or unavailable, fallback to synthetic social graph augmentation based on linguistic community metadata. Alternatively, employ unsupervised social context inference from longitudinal social media data to approximate social determinants."
