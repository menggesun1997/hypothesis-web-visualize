    "title": "Cognitive-Linguistic Typology Attention Networks",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs inadequately model linguistic diversity and typological variation, partly due to lack of integration between cognitive social psychology theories and computational architectures, resulting in bias and poor representation of diverse languages.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of siloed computational and social sciences approaches and leverages the hidden bridge between image processing and cognitive psychology theories (e.g., elaboration likelihood and stereotype content models) to enhance LLMs' sociolinguistic sensitivity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a novel transformer architecture enhanced with a Cognitive-Linguistic Attention Module (CLAM) informed by the elaboration likelihood model (ELM). CLAM modulates token attention weights dynamically based on inferred typological and sociolinguistic features using a cognitive bias estimator trained on stereotype content model datasets. This module integrates visual-textual cues from document image processing pipelines linked to language typology metadata, creating a multi-modal fusion of linguistic and sociocognitive signals guiding LLM training toward nuanced, stereotype-aware contextual embeddings.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate a multilingual, typologically diverse dataset annotated with stereotype and sociolinguistic variables (leveraging translated social psychology studies). 2) Implement baseline LLMs (e.g., mBERT) and develop CLAM as an attention augmentation layer. 3) Train the model on the dataset with and without CLAM. 4) Evaluate on typological representation accuracy, sociolinguistic bias metrics, and downstream tasks (NLI, translation). 5) Perform ablation studies to isolate individual cognitive theory contributions.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A code-switched sentence mixing agglutinative morphology from Turkish and tonal pitch features from Yoruba referencing cultural terms with known stereotypes. Expected Output: The model maintains semantic integrity, correctly disambiguates ambiguous terms, and avoids stereotype reinforcement in language generation tasks, generating culturally sensitive paraphrases.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If CLAM does not improve representation, fallback to training multi-task objectives separately on typology and stereotype detection and combine outputs in a late fusion approach; also consider more explicit incorporation of sociolinguistic rules as symbolic constraints."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an innovative integration of cognitive-linguistic models and multi-modal inputs for enhancing LLM representations. However, the exact computational implementation details of the Cognitive-Linguistic Attention Module (CLAM), especially how it dynamically modulates token attention weights using stereotype content model outputs and typological metadata, lack clarity. Clearer mechanistic description is needed, including how visual-textual cues from document image processing concretely interface with transformer attention kernels, and how cognitive bias estimation quantitatively influences training signals. Without this, assessing the soundness and reproducibility of the approach remains difficult, and it may limit peer validation and debugging during experimentation. Consider including formal equations or architectural diagrams to illustrate data flow and attention weight adjustment logic within CLAM, as well as specifying training regimes for cognitive bias estimators distinct from language models to strengthen mechanistic transparency and grounding in cognitive theory assumptions for this highly interdisciplinary method, ensuring it is conceptually and mathematically coherent and implementable at scale within transformer frameworks like mBERT variants or beyond existing modules widely used in LLMs as baselines for comparison.  \n\nThis clarity will also help discern if integrating stereotype content model datasets potentially risks propagating biases instead of mitigating them, a critical ethical consideration here given the research motivation. Addressing this will substantially improve the scientific rigor and trustworthiness of the method's foundation, a priority as your method claims to bridge complex social-psychological and typological phenomena within a neural architecture context, which is non-trivial and novel but must be concretely supported by robust mechanisms linked to standards in both NLP model design and cognitive computational modeling literatures.  \n\n---\n\nThis is the most critical to fix before feasibility and impact can be convincingly assessed or demonstrated through experiments, ensuring the method is fully sound at its core assumptions and design behavior level.  \n\n\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The Experiment_Plan presents a logically ordered series of steps from dataset curation to ablation studies. However, it requires strengthening in practical considerations and clarity to ensure feasibility and reproducibility. First, curating a multilingual, typologically diverse dataset with stereotype and sociolinguistic annotations is highly challenging, often requiring expert knowledge and cross-disciplinary collaboration; details on dataset sources, annotation protocols, quality control, and scale are needed. Second, the plan should clearly specify evaluation metrics beyond broad categories like \"typological representation accuracy\" and \"sociolinguistic bias metrics\" â€” ideally choose or design benchmark metrics validated in sociolinguistics, bias measurement in NLP, and typological NLP benchmarking communities. Third, the integration of multi-modal inputs from image processing pipelines linked to language typology metadata introduces complexity. A fallback or incremental baseline strategy focusing on simpler uni-modal textual signals before full multi-modal fusion could mitigate risks, supporting development and analysis. Lastly, the plan should address computational resource demands and training stability challenges inherently present when augmenting large transformers with bespoke attention modules conditioned on complex cognitive/social data signals. Consider a more detailed timeline, resource estimate, and risk mitigation strategies related to annotation difficulties and model convergence issues. Incorporating these elements will clarify the practical pathway from concept to meaningful results, increasing the project's credibility and likelihood of success in a competitive research environment. This experimental rigor ultimately underpins validity and confidence for impact claims, especially since the novelty rating suggests substantial existing competing methods requiring strong, empirically supported differentiation.  \n\n---\n\nAddressing these issues sharply improves feasibility assessment and elevates the proposal's technical depth in line with expectations from premier conference standards."
