    "title": "Cultural Heritage Knowledge Graphs for Low-Resource Language Dataset Enrichment",
    "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource language datasets suffer from scarcity and lack cultural contextualization, leading to poor LLM generalization and evaluation in these languages.",
    "Motivation": "This addresses the external gap of underutilized digital humanities resources by combining cultural heritage knowledge graphs with corpus linguistics to create richer, ethically curated datasets, responding to Opportunity 2's call.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct interconnected cultural heritage knowledge graphs (KGs) for underrepresented languages using digital humanities sources (manuscripts, oral histories, art metadata). Link KGs to linguistic corpora to generate culturally contextualized synthetic data via KG-driven data augmentation. Incorporate ethical curation protocols from humanities scholarship. The resulting datasets provide training and evaluation resources reflecting authentic cultural semantics and narratives.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Extract cultural heritage entities and relations from digital humanities archives for target languages.\n2. Build and validate multilingual cultural heritage KGs.\n3. Develop augmentation algorithms to synthesize text segments grounded in KG facts/narratives.\n4. Combine augmented data with existing corpora.\n5. Train/evaluate LLMs on enriched datasets, comparing against baseline corpora.\n6. Assess gains in cultural representativeness and bias mitigation via qualitative and quantitative analyses.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Sample Input: Generate story snippets in Quechua incorporating traditional myths from KG.\nExpected Output: Texts that faithfully embed mythological elements with correct cultural semantics, enhancing LLM authenticity and evaluation for Quechua.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If KG extraction is incomplete, fallback to manual expert curation for seed cultural concepts. Alternatively, use cross-lingual transfer learning from better-resourced related languages to supplement data."
