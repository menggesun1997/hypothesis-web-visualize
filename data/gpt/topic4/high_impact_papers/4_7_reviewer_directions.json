    "title": "Sociotechnical Explainability Modules for Resource-Constrained Multilingual LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Users in linguistically diverse and resource-limited settings lack understandable explanations for LLM outputs, which hampers trust and sociotechnical integration.",
    "Motivation": "Bridges methodological gaps by integrating explainability from healthcare AI decision support and sociotechnical frameworks, enhancing model transparency and fairness in line with Opportunity 1.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design lightweight, multilingual explainability modules coupled with resource-efficient LLM adapters. These modules generate culturally sensitive, accessible explanations of model outputs that leverage interaction histories and user profiles. Employ constrained natural language generation optimized for low-resource devices and evaluate sociotechnical acceptance among diverse user groups.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets with explanation annotations across multiple languages.\n2) Develop compact explanation generators linked to LLM outputs.\n3) Conduct user studies measuring explanation usefulness and trust.\n4) Optimize modules for resource constraints through compression and distillation.\n5) Benchmark against non-explainable baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "For a Malagasy language health recommendation, the system provides a clear, culturally appropriate rationale accessible to low-literacy users, increasing acceptance and adherence.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct explanation generation proves too heavy, implement template-based explainability leveraging detected user context. Alternatively, provide visual or symbolic explanans that require less linguistic complexity."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is well-structured but lacks detail on handling the multilingual and cultural sensitivity challenges inherent to the datasets and user studies. The plan should explicitly address how cross-linguistic explanation annotation consistency will be achieved and how diverse sociocultural factors impacting explanation usefulness and trust will be modeled, measured, and mitigated. Further, more concrete steps for compression and distillation tailored for extreme resource-constrained environments should be elaborated to ensure practical feasibility of deployment on low-end devices. Clarifying these aspects will strengthen the scientific rigor and operational viability of the experiments.  Recommended to incorporate incremental pilot studies and iterative user feedback cycles within diverse linguistic communities to refine modules early on and adaptively handle sociotechnical nuances. This will decrease risk and increase robustness of conclusions regarding trust and acceptance in real world settings, enhancing feasibility confidence overall.  This feedback targets the 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' section specifically for improved granularity and scientific soundness of the experimental roadmap, essential for feasibility assurance in a complex multilingual explainability context.  \n\n---\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict, a promising direction to amplify impact and distinctiveness is to integrate language education paradigms from the global linked concepts. For instance, the explainability modules could be extended to function as language learning aids within the target resource-constrained multilingual settings by providing explanations that simultaneously scaffold language acquisition for low-literacy users. Designing explanations that actively enhance users' foreign language learning and teaching experiences (e.g., with interactive feedback loops tailored to language teacher education programs) could merge sociotechnical explainability with educational impact, broadening the scope beyond healthcare or domain-specific recommendations. This dual-purpose approach may open new avenues for evaluation metrics (beyond trust and acceptance) linked to language learning outcomes and overall quality of education, thereby carving a unique niche that differentiates from existing explainability research and adds substantial societal benefit. \n\nThis feedback pertains to the 'Proposed_Method' and overall impact strategy, encouraging the team to leverage knowledge transfer from language education and teaching domains to strengthen novelty and real-world influence, overcoming the limitations noted in the NOV-COMPETITIVE assessment."
