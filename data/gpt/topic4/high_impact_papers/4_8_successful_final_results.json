        "title": "Multi-Agent Human-AI Coordination Protocols for Linguistically Diverse LLM Adaptation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM adaptation approaches inadequately model or operationalize robust multi-agent human-AI coordination in settings where teams span multiple languages and domain expertise levels, leading to fragile deployments that fail to meet complex sociotechnical demands in real-world multilingual environments such as disaster relief and healthcare.",
        "Motivation": "While multi-agent systems and sociotechnical frameworks have been studied, the integration of linguistically diverse human-AI teams with explicit, formalized coordination protocols remains underexplored, particularly for adapting LLMs across languages and domains. This proposal addresses this gap by developing and validating multi-agent communication and task negotiation protocols that uniquely combine language translation, domain-specific knowledge transfer, and conflict resolution mechanisms. By explicitly modelling interaction dynamics inspired by healthcare teamwork but extended with multi-language negotiation schemas and error-handling feedback loops, our approach advances the state of human-AI collaboration to achieve enhanced robustness and coordination in multilingual socio-technical systems, thus providing novel, reproducible mechanisms beyond existing single-agent or loosely coupled frameworks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a formally specified Multi-Agent Coordination Framework (MACF) for linguistically diverse human-AI teams, combining elements from multi-agent systems, sociotechnical models, and information retrieval principles. MACF features: 1) A protocol layer defining explicit message types (task requests, status updates, negotiation bids) with standardized semantic annotation using shared ontologies enabling cross-language semantic alignment. 2) An adaptive language bridge module integrating state-of-the-art multilingual neural translation with domain-specific glossaries to ensure accurate domain knowledge transfer. 3) A dynamic task allocation algorithm based on iterative contract net protocols extended with linguistic and expertise profiles to negotiate and resolve conflicts semantically and pragmatically. 4) Multi-level feedback loops comprising linguistic error detection, task performance monitoring, and participant satisfaction metrics, to continually adapt communication strategies and error-correction mechanisms. 5) A socio-technical robustness metric that quantifies coordination efficiency, decision accuracy, resource utilization, and sociolinguistic harmony over time. Together, these components operationalize coordination, negotiation, translation, and error handling in a coherent, reproducible framework tailored to complex real-world multilingual scenarios such as disaster response and healthcare teams.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Formally define multilingual collaborative tasks requiring coordination (e.g., logistics planning, clinical decision support) with annotated ontologies.\n2) Develop realistic agent simulations modeling human roles with varied language fluencies, domain expertise, and interaction styles, supported by user behavior modeling drawn from socio-technical literature.\n3) Implement MACF protocols in a multi-agent testbed simulating diverse linguistic and domain scenarios.\n4) Define, compute, and analyze quantitative metrics: coordination efficiency (task completion time, message overhead), decision accuracy (task outcome quality), resource utilization (computing and human effort), and sociotechnical robustness (measured via feedback convergence, error rates, and participant alignment).\n5) Conduct ablation studies varying language diversity, agent expertise profiles, and communication constraints to understand protocol sensitivities.\n6) Design pilot field deployments in collaboration with multilingual disaster response or healthcare partners, obtaining appropriate ethical approvals and permissions, to test scalability and practical feasibility.\n7) In case of MACF complexity challenges, systematically evaluate fallback strategies such as pairwise human-AI modules with fallback communication protocols, measuring their effectiveness in the same metrics.\n8) Use collected data to iteratively refine the protocols, error handling, and feedback mechanisms.\n9) Compare performance against baseline single-agent or loosely coupled models to demonstrate improved sociotechnical robustness and coordination quality.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "1) Disaster Relief Scenario: A coordination team with Swahili and English-speaking human agents and AI agents collaboratively allocate resources and tasks. MACF negotiates dynamically assigning tasks by interpreting multilingual status updates and resolving ambiguous requests via semantic alignment, thereby reducing logistical errors and improving response times.\n2) Healthcare Multilingual Team: Multilingual doctors and AI assistants collaborate on patient triage and diagnostics. The system dynamically translates nuanced medical terms across languages using domain glossaries, negotiates diagnostic hypotheses, and incorporates feedback loops to correct communication errors, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.\n3) Simulated Socio-Technical Environment: Agents with diverse linguistic profiles process information retrieval tasks involving domain-specific queries and collaborative decision-making, allowing controlled measurement of coordination metrics and protocol robustness under controlled perturbations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full multi-agent coordination is computationally or operationally prohibitive, pivot to modular pairwise human-AI interaction units augmented with lightweight fallback communication protocols focused on explicit error detection and recovery. These modules would target two primary languages initially with templated negotiation schemas. Systematically evaluate fallback effectiveness via controlled experiments comparing communication efficiency, error rates, and decision accuracy against the full MACF approach to ensure that simplified methods preserve critical sociotechnical robustness features, providing a pragmatic incremental development path."

The mechanism for language translation interfacing with domain knowledge transfer needs explicit definition, including the structure of feedback loops and error handling in multilingual contexts. Providing a more formalized model or algorithmic outline would strengthen the method's soundness and reproducibility potential, ensuring the approach is well-founded and practically implementable in complex real-world scenarios such as disaster relief or healthcare settings to prevent fragile deployments as stated in the problem statement. Consider specifying how agents negotiate task allocation and resolve conflicts linguistically and semantically within the proposed protocols to improve transparency and robustness of the multi-agent coordination process in multi-language settings. This would substantially bolster the core methodological contribution's clarity and validity as well as facilitate targeted evaluations in experiments or pilot studies that follow. Details on measuring and improving sociotechnical robustness through these protocols would also enhance the proposed mechanism's soundness assessment. Target Section: Proposed_Method"

Specifically, simulation phases should clearly define metrics for coordination efficiency, decision accuracy, and resource utilization — including how linguistic diversity quantitatively impacts these measures. Details on simulating realistic human roles with different language proficiencies and expertise levels must be provided to avoid oversimplified assumptions. The plan's transition from simulation to pilot deployment in multilingual settings needs clear scalability and ethical considerations, including data collection permissions and participant sourcing strategies in diverse communities. Moreover, fallback strategies are mentioned but require concrete experimental contingencies to test their effectiveness systematically if the full multi-agent system proves too complex. Strengthening these aspects will confirm that the experimentation can realistically and conclusively demonstrate the benefit of the coordination protocols over single-agent baselines, thus proving feasibility and robustness before broader deployment.
