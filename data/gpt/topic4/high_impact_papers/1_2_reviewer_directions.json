    "title": "Typology-Informed Cognitive Bias Mitigation for LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs trained without typological and cognitive bias insights risk perpetuating stereotypes and misrepresentations, especially for typologically diverse languages with cultural nuances.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the novel external gap blending cognitive social psychology constructs from hidden bridges with typology to reduce stereotype bias in LLMs, going beyond pure technical or social science approaches by interfacing cognitive bias theories with typological data in training regimes.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a cognitive bias detection and mitigation pipeline that leverages stereotype content model metrics annotated on typologically diverse sentence sets. Embed these as loss functions penalizing stereotype-prone outputs during LLM fine-tuning. Incorporate a typology-aware subnetwork that adjusts token generation probabilities based on sociocultural context cues derived from linguistic typology features, combined with a reinforcement learning reward model shaped by cognitive psychology guidelines to encourage diversity-respecting outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct stereotype-labeled multilingual datasets with rich typological annotations. 2) Train baseline LLMs and evaluate bias metrics. 3) Implement cognitive bias mitigation with stereotype-aware loss and typology subnetworks. 4) Compare performance on stereotype bias, typology representation, and general language tasks. 5) Qualitatively assess language generation for cultural sensitivity.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A prompt generating descriptions for a traditionally marginalized ethnic group’s language with unique typological features. Expected Output: Text free from common stereotypes, respectful and accurate representation preserving typological richness.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If stereotype penalty loss destabilizes training, incorporate adversarial training where a discriminator evaluates stereotype presence, or augment dataset with balanced stereotype counterexamples."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method proposes a complex multi-component architecture combining stereotype content model metrics as loss functions, a typology-aware subnetwork, and a reinforcement learning reward model shaped by cognitive psychology. However, the description lacks clarity on how these components specifically integrate during training and generation. It is not clear how typological features will be encoded, how the subnetwork modulates token probabilities dynamically, or how the reward model’s cognitive psychology guidelines concretely influence reinforcement signals. This weakens confidence in the soundness of the methodological design and its reproducibility. More precise architectural detail, formalization of how stereotype penalties are computed and combined, and how reinforcement learning loops interact with supervised fine-tuning should be provided to solidify the mechanism’s rationale and feasibility within large-scale LLM pipelines. Suggest clarifying these mechanisms with clear workflows or formulas to strengthen understanding and soundness of the approach, especially given the interdisciplinary integration of cognitive science and linguistic typology into LLM training paradigms (target: Proposed_Method)."

However, constructing such a dataset with rich typological and stereotype content annotations across diverse languages is a highly resource-intensive and non-trivial task that may be infeasible without extensive expert involvement, scalable annotation methodologies, or community collaboration. Additionally, the plan lacks clarity on evaluation metrics, baselines for stereotype bias, or criteria for success in cultural sensitivity assessments. There is also a risk that incorporating stereotype penalty loss could destabilize LLM training as acknowledged in the fallback plan, suggesting the experimental plan needs stronger risk mitigation strategies and clearer milestones. Recommending to detail the dataset construction strategy, include realistic annotation methods or proxy signals, define precise evaluation metrics, and provide more robust training stabilization protocols to ensure feasibility and scientific rigor during experimentation (target: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)."
