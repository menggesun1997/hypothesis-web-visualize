        "title": "Cognitive-Linguistic Typology Attention Networks",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs inadequately model linguistic diversity and typological variation, partly due to lack of integration between cognitive social psychology theories and computational architectures, resulting in bias and poor representation of diverse languages.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of siloed computational and social sciences approaches and leverages the hidden bridge between image processing and cognitive psychology theories (e.g., elaboration likelihood and stereotype content models) to enhance LLMs' sociolinguistic sensitivity.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a novel transformer architecture enhanced with a Cognitive-Linguistic Attention Module (CLAM) informed by the elaboration likelihood model (ELM). CLAM modulates token attention weights dynamically based on inferred typological and sociolinguistic features using a cognitive bias estimator trained on stereotype content model datasets. This module integrates visual-textual cues from document image processing pipelines linked to language typology metadata, creating a multi-modal fusion of linguistic and sociocognitive signals guiding LLM training toward nuanced, stereotype-aware contextual embeddings.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate a multilingual, typologically diverse dataset annotated with stereotype and sociolinguistic variables (leveraging translated social psychology studies). 2) Implement baseline LLMs (e.g., mBERT) and develop CLAM as an attention augmentation layer. 3) Train the model on the dataset with and without CLAM. 4) Evaluate on typological representation accuracy, sociolinguistic bias metrics, and downstream tasks (NLI, translation). 5) Perform ablation studies to isolate individual cognitive theory contributions.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A code-switched sentence mixing agglutinative morphology from Turkish and tonal pitch features from Yoruba referencing cultural terms with known stereotypes. Expected Output: The model maintains semantic integrity, correctly disambiguates ambiguous terms, and avoids stereotype reinforcement in language generation tasks, generating culturally sensitive paraphrases.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If CLAM does not improve representation, fallback to training multi-task objectives separately on typology and stereotype detection and combine outputs in a late fusion approach; also consider more explicit incorporation of sociolinguistic rules as symbolic constraints."

        "title": "Multimodal Typology-Social Framework for LLM Training",
        "Problem_Statement": "Fragmented research silos separate computational document image processing methods from sociopolitical and linguistic typology theories, causing LLMs to lack integrative sociopolitical awareness and typological generalizability.",
        "Motivation": "Directly targets the internal gap of siloed thematic islands by building a unified multidisciplinary framework blending computational multimodal algorithms with qualitative political science and sociolinguistic analysis for enhanced LLM typological training grounded in social context.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a three-layer framework: (1) Multimodal feature extraction layer combining document images, text embeddings, and linguistic typology metadata; (2) A sociopolitical embedding synthesis layer encoding political science constructs like power dynamics and language policy effects, parameterized via qualitative input; (3) A top-level adaptive LLM trainer that dynamically biases optimization using sociopolitical embeddings to promote equitable linguistic representation and reduce model bias. The framework includes an interface for experts to input sociolinguistic qualitative data guiding model updates.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets combining OCR document image data from underrepresented languages, annotated with political and social context markers. 2) Baseline LLM trainings without sociopolitical embeddings. 3) Train the proposed framework: extract multimodal features, synthesize sociopolitical embeddings, adapt training. 4) Evaluate model performance on biased language generation detection, typological language tasks, and sociopolitical contextualization accuracy. 5) Conduct user studies with social scientists to validate sociopolitical interpretability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A scanned political manifesto in an endangered language with rich morphological typology and sociopolitical markers of linguistic disenfranchisement. Expected Output: LLM correctly transcribes, semantically interprets the manifesto emphasizing political context, and generates unbiased summaries respectful of linguistic diversity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If integration proves too complex, employ modular training: first fine-tune LLMs on multilingual multimodal datasets, then separately incorporate sociopolitical embeddings as side inputs during inference, analyzing incremental gains."

        "title": "Typology-Informed Cognitive Bias Mitigation for LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLMs trained without typological and cognitive bias insights risk perpetuating stereotypes and misrepresentations, especially for typologically diverse languages with cultural nuances.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the novel external gap blending cognitive social psychology constructs from hidden bridges with typology to reduce stereotype bias in LLMs, going beyond pure technical or social science approaches by interfacing cognitive bias theories with typological data in training regimes.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create a cognitive bias detection and mitigation pipeline that leverages stereotype content model metrics annotated on typologically diverse sentence sets. Embed these as loss functions penalizing stereotype-prone outputs during LLM fine-tuning. Incorporate a typology-aware subnetwork that adjusts token generation probabilities based on sociocultural context cues derived from linguistic typology features, combined with a reinforcement learning reward model shaped by cognitive psychology guidelines to encourage diversity-respecting outputs.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct stereotype-labeled multilingual datasets with rich typological annotations. 2) Train baseline LLMs and evaluate bias metrics. 3) Implement cognitive bias mitigation with stereotype-aware loss and typology subnetworks. 4) Compare performance on stereotype bias, typology representation, and general language tasks. 5) Qualitatively assess language generation for cultural sensitivity.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A prompt generating descriptions for a traditionally marginalized ethnic groupâ€™s language with unique typological features. Expected Output: Text free from common stereotypes, respectful and accurate representation preserving typological richness.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If stereotype penalty loss destabilizes training, incorporate adversarial training where a discriminator evaluates stereotype presence, or augment dataset with balanced stereotype counterexamples."

        "title": "Cross-Domain Cognitive-Social Knowledge Graph for LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Lack of integrated knowledge representations linking computational algorithmic advances, social psychology theories, and linguistic typology hampers comprehensive LLM training that addresses diversity and bias.",
        "Motivation": "Fills the internal siloing gap by constructing a cross-domain heterogeneous knowledge graph unifying linguistic typology metadata, document image processing features, and cognitive social psychology constructs such as attention and stereotypes to inform LLM contextualization inherently.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Build a Knowledge Graph (KG) incorporating nodes from linguistic typologies (morphosyntactic features, language family), document image processing metadata (visual text layout), and cognitive social psychology constructs (e.g., elaboration likelihood paths, stereotype dimensions). Integrate the KG embeddings into LLM input layers, allowing the model to query contextual prior knowledge dynamically during training and inference to adaptively attend to language diversity, typological nuances, and sociocognitive expectations.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Extract and merge data from linguistic databases (WALS), image document datasets, and social psychology corpora. 2) Construct and embed KG using graph neural networks. 3) Fuse KG embeddings into LLM token embeddings. 4) Train and evaluate on multilingual, typologically diverse benchmarks with bias and sociocultural sensitivity metrics. 5) Conduct ablation on KG components' impact.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Text with homographs influenced by typological differences combined with social context cues affecting interpretation. Expected Output: Correct sense disambiguation reflected by KG-informed knowledge, sensitive to stereotypes and typological patterns.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If KG embedding fusion proves ineffective, explore external memory-augmented architectures querying KG at runtime or adopt retrieval-augmented strategies with KG as a source."

        "title": "Typology-Enhanced Visual-Linguistic LLM Training via Rhetorical Device Modeling",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM training methods often ignore the influence of rhetorical devices linked to linguistic typology and cognitive persuasion theories, limiting diversity representation and sociocultural contextualization.",
        "Motivation": "Exploits the hidden bridge between image processing and social psychology framed rhetorical devices to enrich LLM training by modeling rhetorical patterns typologically informed, addressing bias and enhancing nuanced sociolinguistic representation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a training paradigm incorporating rhetorical device detectors trained on multimodal document images capturing visual-textual cues (layout, typography, imagery) and language typological features. Use these detectors to annotate large corpora, then fine-tune LLMs with multi-task loss to jointly predict text and rhetorical device structures, enabling awareness of persuasive linguistic forms across diverse typologies and social contexts.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Annotate multimodal datasets for rhetorical devices spanning typologically diverse languages. 2) Train detectors linking visual and linguistic features. 3) Fine-tune LLMs with combined language modeling and rhetorical device prediction objectives. 4) Evaluate on rhetorical device recognition, multilingual persuasion tasks, and bias reduction benchmarks.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A political speech document image in a polysynthetic language with embedded metaphors and cultural rhetorical devices. Expected Output: LLM-generated summaries capturing rhetorical nuances and culturally sensitive language variation without stereotype reinforcement.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should joint training underperform, isolate rhetorical device modeling as a preprocessing step feeding enhanced embeddings to standard LLM fine-tuning pipelines."
