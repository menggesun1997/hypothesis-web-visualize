        "title": "Federated Benchmarking Framework Integrating Health Services Engineering for Resource-Efficient and Privacy-Preserving LLM Adaptation in Low-Resource Language Settings",
        "Problem_Statement": "Currently, there is no standardized, rigorous, and privacy-aware evaluation framework specifically designed for resource-efficient adaptation of large language models (LLMs) across linguistically diverse, low-resource, and distributed environments. This gap limits reproducibility, hinders systematic understanding of failure modes, and obstructs progress in real-world deployment scenarios with decentralized data and resource constraints.",
        "Motivation": "While existing benchmarks address LLM adaptation broadly, they largely focus on centralized settings and computational metrics, lacking comprehensive evaluation in decentralized, privacy-sensitive contexts typical for low-resource languages. This proposal innovatively combines health services systems engineering frameworks with federated learning concepts to create a modular, federated benchmarking suite. This approach systematically evaluates technical efficiency, linguistic fairness, sociotechnical usability, and privacy-accuracy trade-offs. By integrating federated benchmarking, it substantively advances beyond current efforts, aligning with emerging needs in privacy preservation and resource-constrained NLP deployments—thus addressing the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty gap.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a federated benchmarking framework that extends conventional LLM adaptation evaluation with federated learning setups simulating distributed low-resource devices, incorporating metrics for communication efficiency, decentralized model fairness, privacy preservation (including differential privacy), and sociotechnical usability inspired by health systems outcome frameworks. The framework will incorporate both synthetic and curated real-world datasets spanning diverse low-resource languages, reflecting realistic deployment constraints. Visualization dashboards will be enhanced to compare centralized and federated adaptation performance interactively, highlighting resource usage, privacy-accuracy trade-offs, and user trust indicators. The modular design allows community-driven extensions for evolving metrics and languages.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Conduct an interdisciplinary survey to identify relevant evaluation metrics from health services engineering, NLP fairness, federated learning, and sociotechnical usability literature.\n2) Curate and augment low-resource language datasets by combining existing corpora with synthetically generated samples where data scarcity exists, ensuring linguistic diversity and representativeness. Document dataset provenance meticulously.\n3) Develop federated benchmarking protocols simulating distributed devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi-like IoT hardware), defining tiers of resource and privacy constraints to reflect real-world deployment scenarios.\n4) Implement baseline benchmarks including centralized fine-tuning, adapter tuning, and federated learning approaches with different privacy budgets.\n5) Define rigorous evaluation criteria to verify that the framework surfaces known failure modes (e.g., degradation in performance, bias amplification, or communication bottlenecks) reproducibly.\n6) Establish clear sociotechnical usability evaluation procedures involving user trust surveys and explainability assessments, refined through pilot studies.\n7) Open-source the toolkit alongside comprehensive documentation, including tutorials and an interactive dashboard. Implement an iterative community engagement plan involving workshops, surveys, and feedback channels to guide incremental improvements and adoption milestones.\n8) Incorporate risk mitigation strategies such as fallback to subset metrics if certain data sources or community inputs are delayed, ensuring steady progress.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "A federated benchmarking test on a Swahili dialect question-answering task deployed across simulated low-resource IoT devices reveals that federated adaptation with differential privacy achieves 58% accuracy with 3x less communication cost than centralized fine-tuning, while adapter tuning without privacy achieves 60% accuracy but at higher computational cost. Sociotechnical usability metrics, gathered via user trust surveys, show federated setups improve perceived data privacy and acceptance, despite slight accuracy trade-offs. Visualization dashboards clearly highlight these trade-offs across resource usage, privacy, fairness, and usability dimensions, enabling informed decision-making for deployment.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full integration of federated benchmarking and health services metrics proves overly complex within resource constraints, the plan prioritizes a core subset focusing on resource usage, linguistic fairness, and decentralized performance metrics without privacy preservation initially. Concurrently, we will intensify community engagement to iteratively collect feedback, expanding the framework in successive versions. Synthetic dataset generation will supplement real-world corpora to mitigate data scarcity and diversity bottlenecks while maintaining transparency in documentation."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step-by-Step Experiment Plan, while logically structured, lacks clarity on critical operational details that influence feasibility. For example, the design and validation of the low-resource language datasets require further specification—are these datasets to be collected, curated from existing sources, or synthetically generated? The plan should also clarify the methods and criteria used to validate whether the benchmarking framework successfully surfaces known failure modes, ensuring reproducibility and reliability. Furthermore, open-sourcing the toolkit with thorough documentation is ambitious; explicit strategies for community engagement and iterative feedback should be included. Addressing these aspects can enhance the scientific rigor and practical feasibility of the experiments, preventing potential bottlenecks during implementation and adoption phases.\n\nConsider augmenting the plan with intermediate milestones, risk mitigation strategies for dataset availability and diversity, as well as clear evaluation protocols for sociotechnical usability metrics, which are often subjective. This refinement will boost confidence in achieving the stated goals within a realistic timeframe and resource budget, crucial for a framework intended for wide community use and impact as per the proposal's aims.(Target section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)\"},"

Specifically, incorporating federated benchmarking setups would allow evaluation of LLM adaptation across distributed low-resource devices without centralized data collection, aligning closely with privacy preservation and real-world deployment constraints in linguistically diverse contexts. This integration would also enrich the benchmarking metrics by including aspects of communication efficiency, privacy-accuracy trade-offs, and decentralized model fairness.\n\nFurthermore, adapting the existing visualization dashboards to capture and compare federated learning performance alongside conventional methods could drive stronger community interest and novel research directions. This approach aligns the benchmarking framework more directly with emerging trends and needs in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained NLP deployments, thereby broadening both the scope and impact beyond standard centralized adaptation benchmarks.(Target section: Proposed_Method)"
