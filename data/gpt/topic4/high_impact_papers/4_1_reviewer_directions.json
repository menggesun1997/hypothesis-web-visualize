    "title": "Benchmarking Framework Integrating Health Services Engineering for LLM Adaptation",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is no standardized, rigorous evaluation framework specifically designed for resource-efficient adaptation of LLMs in linguistically diverse, low-resource settings, hindering reproducibility and progress.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap of understanding failure modes and evaluating model efficiency by adopting systematic review and conceptual frameworks from health services systems engineering as per Opportunity 2. Provides a structured, cross-disciplinary benchmarking protocol.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a modular benchmarking suite combining metrics from computational efficiency, linguistic diversity coverage, fairness, and sociotechnical usability inspired by health services outcome frameworks. Incorporate synthetic and real-world low-resource language test sets, and define tiers of resource constraints reflecting deployment environments. Integrate visualization dashboards overlaying technical and social impact metrics for comprehensive evaluation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Survey existing evaluation literature in health services and NLP for relevant metrics.\n2) Design datasets and tasks covering diverse low-resource languages.\n3) Implement baseline benchmarking with current transfer learning LLM methods.\n4) Validate that the framework surfaces known failure modes.\n5) Open-source toolkit deployment with documentation for community adoption.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Using a Swahili dialect question-answering task under resource constraints, the benchmark reveals that standard fine-tuning achieves 60% accuracy but requires 10x more computational cost than adapter tuning, while sociotechnical usability scores highlight poor user trust without explanation modules.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If creating full health systems integration metrics proves too complex, focus on a subset emphasizing resource usage and linguistic fairness metrics. Alternatively, adopt iterative community input cycles to refine benchmark design."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step-by-Step Experiment Plan, while logically structured, lacks clarity on critical operational details that influence feasibility. For example, the design and validation of the low-resource language datasets require further specification—are these datasets to be collected, curated from existing sources, or synthetically generated? The plan should also clarify the methods and criteria used to validate whether the benchmarking framework successfully surfaces known failure modes, ensuring reproducibility and reliability. Furthermore, open-sourcing the toolkit with thorough documentation is ambitious; explicit strategies for community engagement and iterative feedback should be included. Addressing these aspects can enhance the scientific rigor and practical feasibility of the experiments, preventing potential bottlenecks during implementation and adoption phases.\n\nConsider augmenting the plan with intermediate milestones, risk mitigation strategies for dataset availability and diversity, as well as clear evaluation protocols for sociotechnical usability metrics, which are often subjective. This refinement will boost confidence in achieving the stated goals within a realistic timeframe and resource budget, crucial for a framework intended for wide community use and impact as per the proposal's aims.(Target section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)\"},"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the proposal’s interdisciplinary nature, integrating federated learning techniques (from the globally-linked concepts) could substantially enhance the impact and distinctiveness of the framework. Specifically, incorporating federated benchmarking setups would allow evaluation of LLM adaptation across distributed low-resource devices without centralized data collection, aligning closely with privacy preservation and real-world deployment constraints in linguistically diverse contexts. This integration would also enrich the benchmarking metrics by including aspects of communication efficiency, privacy-accuracy trade-offs, and decentralized model fairness.\n\nFurthermore, adapting the existing visualization dashboards to capture and compare federated learning performance alongside conventional methods could drive stronger community interest and novel research directions. This approach aligns the benchmarking framework more directly with emerging trends and needs in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained NLP deployments, thereby broadening both the scope and impact beyond standard centralized adaptation benchmarks.(Target section: Proposed_Method)"
