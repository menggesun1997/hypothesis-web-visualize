    "title": "Ethical and Impact-Sensitive Multilingual LLM Evaluation Pipeline",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing multilingual LLM evaluation pipelines lack integration of ethical considerations and societal impact assessments, particularly for languages marginalized in AI governance frameworks.",
    "Motivation": "Responding to Opportunity 3, this project fills the novel gap linking ethical AI with digital health and policy frameworks by embedding humanities-driven ethical evaluation into multilingual LLM assessment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an evaluation pipeline embedding multi-dimensional ethical metrics including fairness, health literacy impact, and compliance with emerging AI regulatory frameworks (e.g., AI Act). The pipeline leverages interdisciplinary input from digital humanities, legal studies, and public health experts to interpret LLM outputs in diverse languages and contexts. It incorporates domain-specific tests such as mental health chatbot interactions and policy-sensitive text generation, generating transparent ethical evaluation reports.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Define ethical evaluation criteria guided by humanities and legal scholars.\n2. Assemble evaluation datasets spanning health literacy, mental health dialogue, and policy texts in underrepresented languages.\n3. Develop metrics capturing fairness, harm risk, transparency, and regulatory alignment.\n4. Implement multilingual LLM evaluation pipeline integrating these metrics.\n5. Test pipeline on existing LLMs and analyze output diversity and ethical risks.\n6. Collaborate with community stakeholders for validation and feedback.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Prompt: Generate mental health support message in Wolof for users with specific cultural idioms.\nExpected Output: A message demonstrating culturally sensitive, non-stigmatizing language, evaluated for ethical compliance and health literacy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If comprehensive regulatory frameworks are unavailable, fallback on best-practice ethical guidelines from WHO and ethics boards. Alternatively, simplify pipeline to focus on fairness and harm reduction metrics initially."

        "title": "Ethical and Impact-Sensitive Multilingual LLM Evaluation Pipeline Integrating Health Equity and Regulatory Frameworks",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current multilingual LLM evaluation pipelines inadequately embed comprehensive ethical considerations, including societal impacts and health equity perspectives, especially for languages marginalized in AI governance frameworks. There is a critical need for nuanced, context-aware assessments that reflect social determinants of health and emerging civil rights and AI regulatory provisions across jurisdictions.",
        "Motivation": "Building upon the identified competitive novelty space, this project pushes beyond existing multilingual ethical evaluation methods by integrating multidimensional health equity metrics and aligning explicitly with international civil rights laws and AI regulatory frameworks such as the EU AI Act and US legal standards. By bridging conversational AI in healthcare chatbots with social determinants of health and legal policy dimensions, this approach creates a transformative, highly relevant framework that addresses critical gaps in AI ethics, digital health, and governance across underrepresented languages and cultural contexts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a modular, scalable evaluation pipeline embedding multi-layered ethical metrics that incorporate health equity factors and social determinants of health alongside fairness, harm risk, transparency, and compliance with extant and emerging AI regulations (including civil rights laws, US law, and EU AI Act). The pipeline integrates interdisciplinary perspectives from digital humanities, public health, legal scholars specializing in AI policy and civil rights, and healthcare quality improvement experts. It includes domain-specific evaluations focusing on conversational AI chatbot outputs for mental health and healthcare support in marginalized languages. The methodology features partnerships with community organizations and traditional information retrieval system experts to source and validate culturally nuanced datasets and benchmarks. A staged, pilot-driven development prioritizes initial focus on select underrepresented languages (e.g., Wolof and Quechua) to refine metrics and procedures before broader multilingual expansion. Ethical metric quantification leverages mixed-method approaches combining quantitative fairness assessments with qualitative community validation and risk analysis, ensuring replicability and contextual sensitivity.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Convene interdisciplinary expert panels, including digital humanities scholars, public health professionals, legal experts on AI and civil rights laws, and healthcare quality practitioners, to define nuanced ethical evaluation criteria integrating health equity and social determinants.\n2. Establish partnerships with community organizations, linguistic institutions, and traditional information retrieval specialists to source and co-curate high-quality, culturally relevant datasets in selected marginalized languages (initially Wolof and Quechua).\n3. Develop clear, replicable methods for validating datasets including human-in-the-loop cultural sensitivity checks and quantitative data augmentation strategies tailored to underrepresented linguistic contexts.\n4. Design and implement quantitative fairness and harm risk metrics adaptable across languages, complemented by qualitative evaluation protocols involving community stakeholder feedback sessions.\n5. Build the multilingual evaluation pipeline incrementally, starting with pilot testing on Wolof and Quechua datasets and mental health chatbot conversational prompts to evaluate cultural appropriateness, legal compliance, and health literacy impacts.\n6. Conduct systematic benchmarking against traditional information retrieval systems and existing AI chatbot outputs to assess performance and ethical risk differences.\n7. Iterate pipeline design based on pilot results, expanding language coverage and incorporating multi-jurisdictional regulatory frameworks, while publishing transparent ethical evaluation reports.\n8. Engage with health care quality improvement bodies and policy stakeholders for validation, refinement, and real-world applicability of the evaluation framework.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Prompt: Generate a culturally sensitive mental health support message in Wolof that incorporates local idiomatic expressions and addresses social determinants of health relevant to the community.\nExpected Output: A message that demonstrates non-stigmatizing, culturally resonant language promoting mental well-being, evaluated for health literacy, fairness, harm reduction, and compliance with regulatory ethical standards.\n\nPrompt: Produce a policy summary on AI use in digital health services tailored in Quechua, ensuring alignment with local civil rights interpretations and digital health equity principles.\nExpected Output: A legally compliant, culturally contextualized summary that supports informed community access to healthcare technology, verified through expert panel and community stakeholder review.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If comprehensive regulatory frameworks or partnerships with community organizations are delayed, initially prioritize ethical assessment metrics focused on fairness and harm reduction using best-practice guidelines from WHO and established AI ethics boards. Employ synthetic and semi-automated data augmentation to offset limited dataset availability. Progressively integrate legal and health equity dimensions as resources and collaborations mature. Phased scalability ensures tangible deliverables and feasibility within constrained resource settings."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks specificity regarding the sourcing and validation of underrepresented language datasets, which is critical for feasibility. The plan should explicitly address how to acquire high-quality, culturally diverse datasets in marginalized languages, including potential partnerships or data augmentation strategies. Additionally, clearer criteria for selecting interdisciplinary experts and concrete methods for quantifying complex ethical metrics like fairness and harm risk across languages would strengthen the scientific rigor and practical execution of the pipeline. Without these details, the plan risks being overly ambitious and difficult to replicate or validate reliably in such diverse contexts, potentially limiting the feasibility of the proposed methodology at scale or in resource-limited settings. Providing more granular milestones or piloting phases (e.g., initial focus on one or two languages before broader multilingual rollout) would improve feasibility confidence and project management transparency.  This refinement is crucial before full-scale implementation to ensure tangible deliverables and robust evaluation outcomes within realistic resource and time constraints. [FEA-EXPERIMENT]"

          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty is marked as competitive, the proposal can significantly enhance its impact and distinctiveness by explicitly integrating concepts from the global list, especially health equity, social determinants of health, and conversational artificial intelligence in health care chatbots. For example, embedding the social determinants of health into the fairness and harm metrics could provide a more nuanced, context-aware ethical evaluation that reflects real-world disparities in digital health outcomes. Additionally, aligning the pipeline’s ethical evaluation framework explicitly with civil rights laws and emerging US and international AI regulatory frameworks would strengthen policy relevance and applicability. Collaborating with stakeholders in health care quality improvement and traditional information retrieval systems to benchmark or augment the evaluation could widen the scope and applicability, resulting in a more robust and transformative multilingual ethical evaluation framework. This strategic integration will help differentiate the work and catalyze broader adoption and impact across health AI governance ecosystems. [SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION]"
