    "title": "Meta-Transfer Learning with Healthcare-Informed Sociotechnical Regularization",
    "Problem_Statement": "Transfer learning for LLM adaptation in linguistically diverse contexts is often resource-intensive and lacks constraints that capture sociotechnical realities, leading to impractical models in real-world settings.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal transfer learning optimization gaps by borrowing sociotechnical regularization concepts from healthcare sociotechnical modeling, creating models better aligned with real-world complexity and resource constraints.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a meta-transfer learning framework that includes regularizers inspired by healthcare sociotechnical system stability metrics (e.g., error resilience, workflow compatibility). Use auxiliary objectives encoding constraints on linguistic fairness, interaction costs, and adaptation resource budgets. Train LLM adapters with this multi-objective loss to produce robust, socially-aligned models that require fewer adaptation resources.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Formulate sociotechnical regularizers mathematically drawing from healthcare systems literature.\n2) Integrate into adapter tuning pipelines with multilingual corpora.\n3) Evaluate on tasks in multiple low-resource languages.\n4) Compare adaptation speed, resource consumption, and fairness metrics against baselines.\n5) Conduct ablation studies on component contributions.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Given a Hindi clinical text classification task, the model adapted with sociotechnical regularization achieves comparable accuracy with 40% fewer parameters fine-tuned and demonstrates reduced error bias across dialectal variants.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If sociotechnical regularizers degrade model performance, investigate alternative lightweight penalty forms or relax constraints incrementally. Alternatively, incorporate post-hoc calibration layers to correct sociotechnical biases."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method hinges on adapting sociotechnical regularizers from healthcare to language model transfer learning contexts, but the work lacks concrete clarity on how metrics such as error resilience and workflow compatibility will be mathematically formulated and operationalized within the multi-objective loss. Explicit definitions and mechanisms linking healthcare metrics with NLP adapter tuning processes should be detailed to ensure conceptual and technical soundness. Without clear mechanistic exposition, it is challenging to assess the viability of the approach or to reproduce and build upon it effectively. Further, it's essential to justify why these healthcare-inspired constraints are the best fit versus other sociotechnical or domain-general regularizers. Enhancing this section with formal descriptions, pseudo-code, or preliminary formulae would materially improve soundness and reviewer confidence in feasibility and validity of assumptions. This is the highest priority refinement before proceeding to experiments or impact expansions. (Target section: Proposed_Method)"
