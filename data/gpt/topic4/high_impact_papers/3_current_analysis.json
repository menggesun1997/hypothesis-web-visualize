With the technological development of deep learning-based high-precision recognition models and natural generation models, Metaverse is being strengthened with various factors, from mobile-based always-on access to connectivity with reality using virtual currency. The integration of enhanced social activities and neural-net methods requires a new definition of Metaverse suitable for the present, different from the previous Metaverse. This paper divides the concepts and essential techniques necessary for realizing the Metaverse into three components (i.e., hardware, software, and contents) and three approaches (i.e., user interaction, implementation, and application) rather than marketing or hardware approach to conduct a comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, we describe essential methods based on three components and techniques to Metaverse’s representative Ready Player One, Roblox, and Facebook research in the domain of films, games, and studies. Finally, we summarize the limitations and directions for implementing the immersive Metaverse as social influences, constraints, and open challenges.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Recommender Systems Handbook', 'abstract': 'The explosive growth of e-commerce and online environments has made the issue of information search and selection increasingly serious; users are overloaded by options to consider and they may not have the time or knowledge to personally evaluate these options. Recommender systems have proven to be a valuable way for online users to cope with the information overload and have become one of the most powerful and popular tools in electronic commerce. Correspondingly, various techniques for recommendation generation have been proposed. During the last decade, many of them have also been successfully deployed in commercial environments. Recommender Systems Handbook, an edited volume, is a multi-disciplinary effort that involves world-wide experts from diverse fields, such as artificial intelligence, human computer interaction, information technology, data mining, statistics, adaptive user interfaces, decision support systems, marketing, and consumer behavior. Theoreticiansand practitioners from these fields continually seek techniques for more efficient, cost-effective and accurate recommender systems. This handbook aims to impose a degree of order on this diversity, by presenting a coherent and unified repository of recommender systems’ major concepts, theories, methodologies, trends, challenges and applications. Extensive artificial applications, a variety of real-world applications, and detailed case studies are included. Recommender Systems Handbook illustrates how this technology can support the user in decision-making, planning and purchasing processes. It works for well known corporations such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and AT&T.

This single, multidimensional reference work connects the most salient and important contributions to the relevant fields from the behavioral and social sciences as well as health and healthcare. New topics in this 2nd edition are on disabilities, religion/spirituality, sex, sports, politics, government, science, literature, performance and visual arts, environmental quality and sustainable development. The 2nd edition of the Encyclopedia of Quality of Life and Well-being Research is an indispensable reference point for future research and writing topics on quality of life.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Artistic Citizenship', 'abstract': 'Artistic Citizenship: Artistry, Social Responsibility, and Ethical Praxis examines the many ways that artists (amateur and professional), community artist-facilitators, educators, and scholars in music, dance/movement, theater, visual arts, poetry/storytelling, and media and technology conceive and deploy their abilities to advance democratic citizenship and human flourishing in local, national, and international contexts. Among the questions this book addresses are the following: What is the nature and scope of artistic citizenship? How do artists and scholars in different domains conceive the aims, concepts, practical strategies, problems, and “spaces and places” of artistic citizenship? What are the most effective strategies that artists, teachers, and students use to address local, national, and world problems, including violence and international conflicts, poverty, disease, and gender and racial discrimination? What qualities and abilities do amateur and professional artists need to practice, develop, and expand artistic citizenship? What connections exist between ethical-artistic action and artistic citizenship? What is the history of conceptualizing the “why, what, how, who, where, and when” of artistic citizenship? Do particular artistic endeavors have distinctive potentials for nurturing artistic citizenship? If so, what might they be? How can artistic citizenship be pursued without compromising the natures and values of particular artistic practices? What can arts education programs do to motivate artists of all ages and abilities to better serve their communities? How might artistic endeavors informed by a pragmatic “ethic of care” contribute to positive societal change?'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Recommender Systems Handbook', 'abstract': 'This second edition of a well-received text, with 20 new chapters, presents a coherent and unified repository of recommender systems’ major concepts, theories, methodologies, trends, and challenges.

Theoreticians and practitioners from these fields will find this reference to be an invaluable source of ideas, methods and techniques for developing more efficient, cost-effective and accurate recommender systems.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Ontology Matching', 'abstract': 'Ontologies tend to be found everywhere. They are viewed as the silver bullet for many applications, such as database integration, peer-to-peer systems, e-commerce, semantic web services, or social networks. However, in open or evolving systems, such as the semantic web, different parties would, in general, adopt different ontologies. Thus, merely using ontologies, like using XML, does not reduce heterogeneity: it just raises heterogeneity problems to a higher level. Euzenat and Shvaiko’s book is devoted to ontology matching as a solution to the semantic heterogeneity problem faced by computer systems. Ontology matching aims at finding correspondences between semantically related entities of different ontologies. These correspondences may stand for equivalence as well as other relations, such as consequence, subsumption, or disjointness, between ontology entities. Many different matching solutions have been proposed so far from various viewpoints, e.g., databases, information systems, and artificial intelligence. The second edition of Ontology Matching has been thoroughly revised and updated to reflect the most recent advances in this quickly developing area, which resulted in more than 150 pages of new content. In particular, the book includes a new chapter dedicated to the methodology for performing ontology matching. It also covers emerging topics, such as data interlinking, ontology partitioning and pruning, context-based matching, matcher tuning, alignment debugging, and user involvement in matching, to mention a few. More than 100 state-of-the-art matching systems and frameworks were reviewed. With Ontology Matching, researchers and practitioners will find a reference book that presents currently available work in a uniform framework. Inparticular, the work and the techniques presented in this book can be equally applied to database schema matching, catalog integration, XML schema matching and other related problems. The objectives of the book include presenting (i) the state of the art and (ii) the latest research results in ontology matching by providing a systematic and detailed account of matching techniques and matching systems from theoretical, practical and application perspectives.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Encyclopedia of Quality of Life and Well-Being Research', 'abstract': 'The aim of this encyclopedia is to provide a comprehensive reference work on scientific and other scholarly research on the quality of life, including health-related quality of life research or also called patient-reported outcomes research. Since the 1960s two overlapping but fairly distinct research communities and traditions have developed concerning ideas about the quality of life, individually and collectively, one with a fairly narrow focus on health-related issues and one with a quite broad focus. In many ways, the central issues of these fields have roots extending to the observations and speculations of ancient philosophers, creating a continuous exploration by diverse explorers in diverse historic and cultural circumstances over several centuries of the qualities of human existence. What we have not had so far is a single, multidimensional reference work connecting the most salient and important contributions to the relevant fields. Entries are organized alphabetically and cover basic concepts, relatively well established facts, lawlike and causal relations, theories, methods, standardized tests, biographic entries on significant figures, organizational profiles, indicators and indexes of qualities of individuals and of communities of diverse sizes, including rural areas, towns, cities, counties, provinces, states, regions, countries and groups of countries.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'The Palgrave Dictionary of Transnational History, From the mid-19th century to the present day', 'abstract': \"Written and edited by many of the world's foremost scholars of transnational history, this Dictionary challenges readers to look at the contemporary world in a new light.

Work environments are often technology-heavy, while problems are frequently ill-defined and tackled by multidisciplinary teams. This book contains insights based on research\\xa0 conducted as part of a major international project supported by Cisco, Intel and Microsoft. It faces these new working environments head-on, delineating new ways of thinking about ‘21st-century’ skills and including operational definitions of those skills. The authors focus too on fresh approaches to educational assessment, and present methodological and technological solutions to the barriers that hinder ICT-based assessments of these skills, whether in large-scale surveys or classrooms. Equally committed to defining its terms and providing practical solutions, and including international perspectives and comparative evaluations of assessment methodology and policy, this volume tackles an issue at the top of most educationalists’ agendas.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'The Routledge International Companion to Multicultural Education', 'abstract': 'This volume is the first authoritative reference work to provide a truly comprehensive international description and analysis of multicultural education around the world. It is organized around key concepts and uses case studies from various nations in different parts of the world to exemplify and illustrate the concepts. Case studies are from many nations, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Spain, Norway, Bulgaria, Russia, South Africa, Japan, China, India, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brazil, and Mexico. Two chapters focus on regions – Latin America and the French-speaking nations in Africa. The book is divided into ten sections, covering theory and research pertaining to curriculum reform, immigration and citizenship, language, religion, and the education of ethnic and cultural minority groups among other topics.

    "title": "Landscape Map for Privacy-Preserving Approaches in Diverse Linguistic Data Collection for LLM Development",
    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem emerging from the foundational literature and concept topology is focused on leveraging advanced neural network methods, generative and recognition models, and ontology/schema matching to collect and utilize diverse linguistic data while addressing privacy concerns, particularly in large-scale contexts like social platforms (e.g., Facebook research). The core paradigms revolve around deep learning architectures (neural nets, generative models), representation and integration of heterogeneous data schemas (ontology/schema matching), and social/scientific research on data quality and ethical frameworks. The thematic islands reflect clusters around generative modeling linked with hardware/software approaches; life and social sciences concerns including sustainability and well-being; artistic citizenship emphasizing social and educational implications; and formal data integration methods via ontology matching. Together, these indicate a multidisciplinary approach involving computer science, social sciences, and ethical education frameworks, aiming to enable rich, privacy-aware linguistic data collection and modeling.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: The analyzed papers lack explicit bridging concepts (no bridge nodes) linking machine learning models (generative, neural nets) with social science and ethical domains (life research, artistic citizenship), indicating siloed research clusters. Stated limitations include challenges in handling heterogeneity of data and resolving semantic mismatches in ontologies, as well as difficulties in balancing privacy requirements with data utility. Furthermore, the lack of integrated frameworks for privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored to diverse linguistic data from socially complex sources (e.g., diverse cultural or artistic expression contexts) remains unresolved.\n\nExternal/Novel Gaps: Global GPS analysis reveals hidden bridges currently overlooked. For example, concepts linking 'generative models' with 'life research' and 'artistic citizenship' indicate potential to integrate cognitive and psychological models of wellbeing, creative expression, and social support into linguistic data modeling. Similarly, 'generative model' connections with 'schema matching' suggest that advanced machine learning techniques like variational autoencoders and zero-shot learning can enhance semantic integration under privacy constraints. These interdisciplinary bridges highlight that incorporating psychological wellbeing, social cognition, and advanced semantic integration methods can address current gaps in developing privacy-aware, diverse linguistic datasets. This integration is not reflected in the current foundational papers but represents a promising cross-disciplinary frontier.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Combine advanced generative models with psychological constructs from 'life research' (e.g., mental wellbeing, autobiographical memory) to develop privacy-preserving synthetic data generation methods that reflect diverse linguistic and cognitive states, addressing the internal gap of realistic yet anonymized linguistic data scarcity.\n\nOpportunity 2: Leverage linkages between 'generative models' and 'schema matching' via techniques such as variational autoencoders and zero-shot learning to create adaptive privacy-preserving ontology matching frameworks. This can improve semantic heterogeneity resolution in multilingual and multicultural linguistic datasets while ensuring data privacy.\n\nOpportunity 3: Integrate artistic citizenship concepts with generative modeling approaches to develop culturally sensitive language models that preserve linguistic diversity and ethical considerations. By embedding insights from arts education and social responsibility, researchers can address current blind spots in data collection concerning marginalized or underrepresented groups, thus enhancing inclusiveness in LLM development with privacy safeguards."
