    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs trained without typological and cognitive bias insights risk perpetuating stereotypes and misrepresentations, especially for typologically diverse languages with cultural nuances.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the novel external gap blending cognitive social psychology constructs from hidden bridges with typology to reduce stereotype bias in LLMs, going beyond pure technical or social science approaches by interfacing cognitive bias theories with typological data in training regimes.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a cognitive bias detection and mitigation pipeline that leverages stereotype content model metrics annotated on typologically diverse sentence sets. Embed these as loss functions penalizing stereotype-prone outputs during LLM fine-tuning. Incorporate a typology-aware subnetwork that adjusts token generation probabilities based on sociocultural context cues derived from linguistic typology features, combined with a reinforcement learning reward model shaped by cognitive psychology guidelines to encourage diversity-respecting outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct stereotype-labeled multilingual datasets with rich typological annotations. 2) Train baseline LLMs and evaluate bias metrics. 3) Implement cognitive bias mitigation with stereotype-aware loss and typology subnetworks. 4) Compare performance on stereotype bias, typology representation, and general language tasks. 5) Qualitatively assess language generation for cultural sensitivity.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A prompt generating descriptions for a traditionally marginalized ethnic group’s language with unique typological features. Expected Output: Text free from common stereotypes, respectful and accurate representation preserving typological richness.",

        "title": "Typology-Informed Cognitive Bias Mitigation for Language Models with Explicit Mechanistic Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) trained without explicit incorporation of linguistic typology and cognitive bias frameworks risk perpetuating stereotypes and misrepresentations, especially for typologically diverse languages and their associated cultural contexts. This gap causes inaccurate and culturally insensitive generation, hindering inclusive and respectful NLP applications.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work has separately addressed cognitive biases or engaged typological features, this research innovatively integrates cognitive social psychology constructs—specifically the stereotype content model—with linguistic typology insights grounded in sociolinguistics and generative linguistics. Unlike earlier approaches, it provides a principled, mechanistically explicit architecture that modulates token generation through typology-aware dynamic subnetworks and reinforcement learning guided by cognitive bias theories. This hybrid interdisciplinary approach leverages varieties of language and cultural practices to produce linguistically and culturally sensitive outputs, setting a new benchmark beyond existing bias mitigation and multilingual modeling strategies.",
        "Proposed_Method": "The proposed method comprises a three-part integrated architecture detailed as follows: (1) Stereotype Penalty Computation: We formalize stereotype presence as a continuous scalar penalty calculated using stereotype content model-based metrics annotated on sentence-level typologically diverse datasets. Formally, for generated text y conditioned on input x, penalty P(y|x) = \\sum_i w_i * BiasMetric_i(y,x), where BiasMetric_i represents stereotype dimensions (e.g., warmth, competence) normalized per typological profile and w_i are learned weights. (2) Typology-Aware Subnetwork: Typological features (morphosyntactic, phonological, and semantic category distributions) are encoded as vectors T extracted from linguistic databases (e.g., WALS) and embedded via a dedicated neural encoder. This embedding modulates the base LM's token probability distribution dynamically via gating: p'(t|context) = p(t|context) * g(T, context), where g is a learned function adjusting probabilities to respect sociocultural cues. (3) Reinforcement Learning with Cognitive Bias-Informed Rewards: A reward model R(y|x) integrates the stereotype penalty and fluency, R = \u00021 \u00021 P(y|x) + \u00022 \u00022 FluencyScore(y), with hyperparameters balancing fidelity and bias reduction. We implement Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) fine-tuning where policy gradients optimize generation minimizing stereotype presence while preserving linguistic quality. Algorithmic workflow: supervised fine-tuning with typology conditioning \u00021\u00021&gt; initial LM, then reinforcement tuning using R. These components synchronize through a pipeline enabling reproducibility: typological embeddings feed the subnetwork modulating token logits; stereotype penalties backpropagate loss gradients; reinforcement rewards guide long-term bias reduction. This explicit formalization, coupled with interdisciplinary linguistic theory, advances over generic bias mitigation by contextually encoding cultural-linguistic diversity and cognitive science principles into large-scale LLM training.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Construction: Initiate with existing multilingual corpora augmented via semi-automated annotation using proxy signals (e.g., lexical stereotype lexicons and cultural practice markers) refined by expert validation in a focused set of typologically and culturally diverse languages, to balance resource constraints and quality. Utilize community collaboration platforms and active learning to scale annotation. 2) Baseline Establishment: Fine-tune a state-of-the-art multilingual LLM (e.g., mT5 or BLOOM) on the constructed dataset without bias mitigation; measure stereotype bias using established metrics such as StereoSet and newly adapted stereotype content model scores, alongside typology representation integrity. 3) Model Implementation: Integrate the typology-aware subnetwork with encoded linguistic features, implement the stereotype penalty loss with formal formulas, and construct a reinforcement learning reward function aligned with cognitive psychology guidance. Conduct ablation testing on each module. 4) Evaluation: Quantitatively assess bias mitigation effectiveness using stereotype presence reduction, typological feature retention, and baseline NLP task performance metrics (perplexity, BLEU). Qualitatively evaluate via expert reviews of generated text for cultural sensitivity and respectfulness with detailed criteria and inter-annotator agreement. 5) Stability and Risk Mitigation: Monitor training dynamics robustly. If stereotype penalty destabilizes training, implement fallback adversarial discriminator training or curriculum learning introducing stereotype counterexamples progressively. Adopt gradient clipping and adaptive learning rates to stabilize convergence. 6) Iterative Refinement: Update dataset annotations and model based on evaluation, fostering iterative improvement and community feedback cycles.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Describe the traditional language practices of the !Kung San people, a marginalized ethnic group with distinct click consonants and typological uniqueness.\" Expected Output: \"The !Kung San language, rich in click consonant phonology characteristic of its Khoisan roots, is spoken with unique morphosyntactic features reflecting the community's cultural heritage. Descriptions respect their traditions and avoid stereotypes, emphasizing linguistic diversity and sociocultural context authentically.\"",
        "Fallback_Plan": "In case stereotype penalty losses generate unstable gradients or degrade generation quality, switch to adversarial training where a discriminator network evaluates stereotype presence and guides the generator indirectly, reducing direct loss penalties. Alternatively, implement data augmentation techniques adding balanced stereotype counterexamples to regularize learning. Employ curriculum learning strategies to gradually introduce stereotype-sensitive tasks, ensuring training stability. Conduct hyperparameter tuning to moderate penalty influence. These fallback strategies maintain mitigation objectives while preserving training feasibility and output quality."

However, the description lacks clarity on how these components specifically integrate during training and generation. It is not clear how typological features will be encoded, how the subnetwork modulates token probabilities dynamically, or how the reward model’s cognitive psychology guidelines concretely influence reinforcement signals. This weakens confidence in the soundness of the methodological design and its reproducibility. More precise architectural detail, formalization of how stereotype penalties are computed and combined, and how reinforcement learning loops interact with supervised fine-tuning should be provided to solidify the mechanism’s rationale and feasibility within large-scale LLM pipelines. Suggest clarifying these mechanisms with clear workflows or formulas to strengthen understanding and soundness of the approach, especially given the interdisciplinary integration of cognitive science and linguistic typology into LLM training paradigms (target: Proposed_Method)."

However, constructing such a dataset with rich typological and stereotype content annotations across diverse languages is a highly resource-intensive and non-trivial task that may be infeasible without extensive expert involvement, scalable annotation methodologies, or community collaboration. Additionally, the plan lacks clarity on evaluation metrics, baselines for stereotype bias, or criteria for success in cultural sensitivity assessments. There is also a risk that incorporating stereotype penalty loss could destabilize LLM training as acknowledged in the fallback plan, suggesting the experimental plan needs stronger risk mitigation strategies and clearer milestones. Recommending to detail the dataset construction strategy, include realistic annotation methods or proxy signals, define precise evaluation metrics, and provide more robust training stabilization protocols to ensure feasibility and scientific rigor during experimentation (target: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)."
