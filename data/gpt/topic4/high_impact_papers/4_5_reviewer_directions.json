    "title": "Cross-Lingual Sociotechnical Failure Mode Simulation for LLM Evaluation",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is insufficient understanding and evaluation of failure modes of LLMs adapted to linguistically diverse, low-resource environments, especially concerning sociotechnical interactions.",
    "Motivation": "Fulfills the internal gap of failure mode understanding by adapting simulation frameworks from healthcare systems to systematically generate and study sociotechnical failure scenarios, aligning with Opportunity 2.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a simulation environment that mimics diverse user interactions, language-specific nuances, and sociotechnical variables such as cultural norms and organizational constraints. Use this to systematically stress-test adapted LLMs under varying conditions to expose emergent failures. Incorporate user behavior models inspired by healthcare decision-making studies to model human-AI interactions and miscommunications.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Model sociotechnical parameters from literature and field studies.\n2) Generate synthetic test cases incorporating these parameters for multilingual NLP tasks.\n3) Evaluate existing adapted LLMsâ€™ performance and failure patterns.\n4) Analyze failures to guide model and interface improvements.\n5) Validate findings with expert human evaluations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "A Spanish dialect clinical chatbot simulation that tests responses to cultural-specific idioms and varying literacy levels reveals systematic misunderstanding in patient self-reports leading to misdiagnosis risk.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If simulation complexity is too high, begin with static stress test scenarios focusing on critical linguistic and sociotechnical variables. Alternatively, integrate crowd-sourced evaluations from native speakers to approximate sociotechnical variance."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed simulation framework to mimic sociotechnical failure modes in cross-lingual LLMs is promising, the mechanism by which complex sociotechnical variables (e.g., cultural norms, organizational constraints) and nuanced user behaviors will be realistically modeled and controlled remains insufficiently detailed. The proposal should clarify how it will integrate interdisciplinary models (from healthcare decision-making and sociolinguistics) into computational simulation, and how the interplay between linguistic diversity and sociotechnical factors will be operationalized in a reproducible manner. Greater clarity on this mechanism will strengthen the soundness of the approach and enable better reproducibility and validation by others in the community, addressing potential over-simplification risks inherent in simulated environments for sociotechnical phenomena, especially across languages and cultures. This could involve specifying data sources, modeling methods, and parameterization strategies explicitly in the Proposed_Method section to reduce ambiguity and bolster confidence in the methodological soundness of the simulation design and outcomes evaluation process, which is key for acceptance in top-tier venues and practical relevance in real-world applications such as healthcare chatbots noted in the example scenario (Spanish dialect clinical chatbot)."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating, the proposal would benefit significantly from integrating concepts and methods from the globally linked areas such as 'HCI International' and 'AI assistance' to improve realism and user-centric evaluation within the simulation environment. Specifically, incorporating adaptive instructional system methodologies and human-computer interaction frameworks could enhance the modeling of user behavior dynamics and sociotechnical contextual factors. Also, leveraging advances in natural language processing and neural language models for multilingual settings, combined with human-in-the-loop evaluation strategies from HCI research, can further strengthen the evaluation's robustness. Embedding these interdisciplinary insights and state-of-the-art adaptive system principles can increase both the methodological novelty and the practical impact of the research, distinguishing it from existing works and aligning it more closely with prominent conference themes in ML and NLP, thereby elevating its competitive edge and long-term relevance."
