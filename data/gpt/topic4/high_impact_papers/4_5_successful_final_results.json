    "Problem_Statement": "There is insufficient understanding and evaluation of failure modes of LLMs adapted to linguistically diverse, low-resource environments, especially concerning sociotechnical interactions.",
    "Motivation": "Fulfills the internal gap of failure mode understanding by adapting simulation frameworks from healthcare systems to systematically generate and study sociotechnical failure scenarios, aligning with Opportunity 2.",

        "title": "Interdisciplinary Cross-Lingual Sociotechnical Failure Mode Simulation for Adaptive LLM Evaluation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) adapted to low-resource, linguistically diverse environments lack systematic understanding and reproducible modeling of complex sociotechnical failure modes arising from interactions between language nuances and socio-cultural factors.",
        "Motivation": "Although prior failure mode studies acknowledge sociotechnical contexts, they often oversimplify cultural and organizational influences, limiting practical relevance and reproducibility. This proposal leverages interdisciplinary frameworks—combining sociolinguistics, healthcare decision-making, and adaptive instructional systems—to create a rigorously parameterized simulation environment. By integrating state-of-the-art natural language processing, neural language models for multilingual settings, and human-in-the-loop HCI evaluation, our approach advances beyond existing failure assessments. This integration not only addresses key translational gaps in real-world domains like healthcare chatbots but also elevates methodological novelty, meeting the demands of top-tier ML and NLP venues and enhancing long-term impact.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose constructing a modular simulation platform that models sociotechnical failure modes through an interdisciplinary mechanism: first, sociotechnical parameters (e.g., cultural norms, organizational constraints) will be operationalized based on literature from sociolinguistics and healthcare decision-making, using mixed-method data sources including multilingual corpora, ethnographic studies, and organizational workflow logs. These parameters will be encoded as adjustable computational features within the simulation. The platform incorporates adaptive instructional system principles from HCI International to model evolving user competencies and behavioral adaptations during human-AI interaction. Neural multilingual language models (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R) will generate and validate linguistically nuanced test cases, capturing dialectal and literacy variations. We introduce a human-in-the-loop evaluation framework inspired by HCI research, combining expert annotation and crowd-sourced feedback from native speakers to iteratively calibrate and validate simulation realism and failure mode manifestations. This comprehensive approach explicitly accounts for interplay between linguistic diversity, sociotechnical variables, and user dynamics, with parameterization strategies and data provenance documented for reproducibility. Evaluation metrics will include clustering quality indices such as Davies-Bouldin and Calinski-Harabasz scores to quantitatively characterize simulated failure mode clusters, supporting systematic analysis and benchmarking.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Systematic literature review and data collection to identify and parametrize sociotechnical factors across target languages and domains.\n2) Development of a modular simulation engine integrating sociotechnical parameters, adaptive instructional models, and multilingual neural language generators.\n3) Generation of synthetic sociotechnical failure scenarios reflecting complex interactions between cultural norms and linguistic variations.\n4) Iterative evaluation with human-in-the-loop feedback from domain experts and native speakers to refine scenario realism and model behavior.\n5) Quantitative failure mode clustering and analysis using Davies-Bouldin and Calinski-Harabasz indices.\n6) Application of the platform to evaluate existing cross-lingual LLM adaptations in healthcare chatbot contexts.\n7) Dissemination of the simulation framework and datasets with full documentation to ensure reproducibility and benchmarking by the wider research community.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "A Spanish dialect clinical chatbot simulation testing patient interactions under variable literacy levels and culturally specific idiomatic expressions, combined with organizational constraints such as clinic workflow limitations. The simulation reveals how nuanced misinterpretations of idioms combined with sociotechnical factors lead to risks of misdiagnosis. Through adaptive instructional modeling, simulated users adjust question phrasing over time, exposing emergent failure modes in real-world interaction dynamics.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should the full simulation framework exceed complexity or resource constraints, the project will pivot to constructing a curated set of static, parameterized stress-test scenarios targeting the highest impact linguistic and sociotechnical variables. Complementary human-in-the-loop evaluations via targeted crowd-sourcing of native speakers and domain experts will approximate sociotechnical variance, enabling focused examination of failure modes. This approach preserves the core novelty around interdisciplinary integration and human-centered evaluation while streamlining implementation."

The proposal should clarify how it will integrate interdisciplinary models (from healthcare decision-making and sociolinguistics) into computational simulation, and how the interplay between linguistic diversity and sociotechnical factors will be operationalized in a reproducible manner. Greater clarity on this mechanism will strengthen the soundness of the approach and enable better reproducibility and validation by others in the community, addressing potential over-simplification risks inherent in simulated environments for sociotechnical phenomena, especially across languages and cultures. This could involve specifying data sources, modeling methods, and parameterization strategies explicitly in the Proposed_Method section to reduce ambiguity and bolster confidence in the methodological soundness of the simulation design and outcomes evaluation process, which is key for acceptance in top-tier venues and practical relevance in real-world applications such as healthcare chatbots noted in the example scenario (Spanish dialect clinical chatbot)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating, the proposal would benefit significantly from integrating concepts and methods from the globally linked areas such as 'HCI International' and 'AI assistance' to improve realism and user-centric evaluation within the simulation environment. Specifically, incorporating adaptive instructional system methodologies and human-computer interaction frameworks could enhance the modeling of user behavior dynamics and sociotechnical contextual factors. Also, leveraging advances in natural language processing and neural language models for multilingual settings, combined with human-in-the-loop evaluation strategies from HCI research, can further strengthen the evaluation's robustness. Embedding these interdisciplinary insights and state-of-the-art adaptive system principles can increase both the methodological novelty and the practical impact of the research, distinguishing it from existing works and aligning it more closely with prominent conference themes in ML and NLP, thereby elevating its competitive edge and long-term relevance."
