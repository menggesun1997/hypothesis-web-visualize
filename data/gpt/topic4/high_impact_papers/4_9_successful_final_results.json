        "title": "Federated Context-Aware Resource Scheduling for Privacy-Preserving Multilingual LLM Adaptation Using Process Mining",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing resource allocation methods for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple languages typically employ static or simplistic scheduling that does not dynamically balance sociotechnical context signals such as user demand, task complexity, linguistic equity, or privacy constraints. This leads to inefficiencies, inequities in language representation, and challenges in respecting decentralized data privacy across heterogeneous regions and user bases.",
        "Motivation": "To address these issues and overcome the NOV-COMPETITIVE nature of prior work, this proposal integrates federated learning paradigms with a context-aware resource scheduler to enable privacy-preserving, decentralized multilingual LLM adaptation. By leveraging concepts from Advanced Information Systems Engineering—specifically process mining—we aim to extract fine-grained workflow insights to inform adaptive, real-time scheduling decisions. This cross-disciplinary fusion enhances novelty by coupling dynamic sociotechnical resource optimization with federated adaptation and workflow analytics, leading to improved efficiency, linguistic equity, privacy, and scalability in large-scale multilingual NLP deployment.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a federated adaptive resource scheduling framework that orchestrates LLM adaptation tasks across decentralized, heterogeneous nodes representing diverse linguistic communities. The core scheduler employs a multi-objective, explainable decision-making algorithm that integrates: (1) predictive models of user demand and system load; (2) quantitative task complexity assessments derived from natural language processing metrics; (3) linguistic equity indices prioritizing under-served languages and dialects; (4) privacy and resource constraints inherent in federated architectures; and (5) dynamic workflow bottleneck insights generated via process mining techniques applied to federated system logs and metadata.\n\nThe decision-making mechanism uses a hierarchical weighted scoring and constraint-satisfaction approach. Stepwise, it first forecasts demand and load per node, then scores adaptation tasks by combining normalized complexity and equity metrics. These scores are adjusted by node-specific privacy/resource constraints and refined using workflow bottleneck signals to mitigate inefficiencies. Real-time feedback loops incorporate monitoring data using lightweight incremental updates to avoid instability or computational overhead. This transparent algorithm architecture is designed for robustness and reproducibility, with detailed model components and parameter tunings documented for soundness verification.\n\nBy tightly coupling federated learning's privacy-preserving model updates with this context-aware scheduler guided by process mining insights, our system achieves scalable, equitable, efficient multilingual LLM adaptation across decentralized environments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multimodal deployment context data across decentralized linguistic nodes, including user demand logs, task metadata, and system performance metrics, ensuring privacy compliance.\n2) Develop and validate predictive demand and load forecasting models per node.\n3) Extract workflow patterns and bottlenecks using process mining on federated log data.\n4) Code the multi-objective hierarchical scheduler integrating demand, complexity, equity, privacy constraints, and bottleneck insights.\n5) Deploy the federated adaptation system in simulation with realistic heterogeneous resource and privacy settings.\n6) Evaluate performance on resource efficiency, linguistic equity, privacy adherence, system responsiveness, and scalability compared to baseline static and round-robin schedulers.\n7) Conduct ablation studies analyzing the contribution of each scheduler component and process mining integration.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "In a federated multilingual customer service platform spanning multiple geographic regions, the scheduler federates LLM adaptation across data-local nodes. During peak usage, the system dynamically allocates resources to prioritize under-served dialects while respecting strict local data privacy laws. Process mining detects workflow delays in specific adaptation pipelines, prompting adaptive rescheduling that reduces bottlenecks and improves overall system responsiveness. This approach outperforms traditional centralized or static scheduling by balancing privacy, equity, and efficiency seamlessly.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time integration of process mining or federated constraints induces instability or excessive overhead, we will implement a tiered approach: (a) perform offline periodic workflow and bottleneck analysis to generate scheduling heuristics updated incrementally; (b) apply priority-based static allocation heuristics derived from these offline insights while maintaining federated privacy safeguards. This hybrid approach ensures system robustness and scalability while still improving over baseline methods."
