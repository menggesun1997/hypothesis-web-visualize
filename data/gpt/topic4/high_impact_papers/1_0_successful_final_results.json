    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs inadequately model linguistic diversity and typological variation, partly due to lack of integration between cognitive social psychology theories and computational architectures, resulting in bias and poor representation of diverse languages.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of siloed computational and social sciences approaches and leverages the hidden bridge between image processing and cognitive psychology theories (e.g., elaboration likelihood and stereotype content models) to enhance LLMs' sociolinguistic sensitivity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a novel transformer architecture enhanced with a Cognitive-Linguistic Attention Module (CLAM) informed by the elaboration likelihood model (ELM). CLAM modulates token attention weights dynamically based on inferred typological and sociolinguistic features using a cognitive bias estimator trained on stereotype content model datasets. This module integrates visual-textual cues from document image processing pipelines linked to language typology metadata, creating a multi-modal fusion of linguistic and sociocognitive signals guiding LLM training toward nuanced, stereotype-aware contextual embeddings.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate a multilingual, typologically diverse dataset annotated with stereotype and sociolinguistic variables (leveraging translated social psychology studies). 2) Implement baseline LLMs (e.g., mBERT) and develop CLAM as an attention augmentation layer. 3) Train the model on the dataset with and without CLAM. 4) Evaluate on typological representation accuracy, sociolinguistic bias metrics, and downstream tasks (NLI, translation). 5) Perform ablation studies to isolate individual cognitive theory contributions.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A code-switched sentence mixing agglutinative morphology from Turkish and tonal pitch features from Yoruba referencing cultural terms with known stereotypes. Expected Output: The model maintains semantic integrity, correctly disambiguates ambiguous terms, and avoids stereotype reinforcement in language generation tasks, generating culturally sensitive paraphrases.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If CLAM does not improve representation, fallback to training multi-task objectives separately on typology and stereotype detection and combine outputs in a late fusion approach; also consider more explicit incorporation of sociolinguistic rules as symbolic constraints."

        "title": "Cognitive-Linguistic Typology Attention Networks with Explicit Mechanistic Design and Robust Experimental Framework",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to inadequately capture linguistic diversity and typological variation, due in part to a lack of rigorous integration between cognitive social psychology theories and computational architectures. This deficiency leads to sociolinguistic biases and poor representation of diverse and global language phenomena, limiting natural language understanding and intercultural sensitivity in AI systems.",
        "Motivation": "While prior research has explored sociolinguistic bias mitigation and typological representation, existing approaches often treat these domains separately or rely on implicit heuristics. This proposal uniquely bridges cognitive social psychology models, typological metadata, and transformer architectures through a transparent, mathematically rigorous module. By formally integrating stereotype content and elaboration likelihood models into multi-modal attention mechanisms, and grounding them in computationally precise modules that interface visual, linguistic, and sociocognitive signals, our approach advances beyond competitive prior work by enhancing both linguistic intelligence and emotional engagement in LLMs. This integration is particularly crucial for modeling language use in globalized, multilingual, and multicultural contexts, situating the proposal at the intersection of NLP, linguistic anthropology, and applied linguistics with direct implications for effective language education and abusive language detection.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel transformer extension named the Cognitive-Linguistic Attention Module (CLAM), designed with explicit mechanistic clarity. Formally, CLAM modulates the standard self-attention weight matrix \\( A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n} \\) where \\(n\\) is sequence length, by incorporating cognitive bias estimates and typological priors as multiplicative and additive factors. Specifically, for query-key pairs \\((q_i,k_j)\\), CLAM computes adjusted attention weights:\n\n\\[\nA'_{ij} = \\frac{\\exp\\big( \\frac{(q_i W_Q)(k_j W_K)^T}{\\sqrt{d}} + B_{ij} + T_{ij} \\big)}{\\sum_{l=1}^n \\exp\\big( \\frac{(q_i W_Q)(k_l W_K)^T}{\\sqrt{d}} + B_{il} + T_{il} \\big)}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(W_Q, W_K\\) are learned projection matrices, \\(B_{ij}\\) is a bias term derived from the output of a separately trained cognitive bias estimator network (CBEN) informed by stereotype content model (SCM) datasets, and \\(T_{ij}\\) encodes typological similarity scores from metadata embedding layers. \n\nThe CBEN is a dedicated neural module pre-trained on SCM-annotated social psychology corpora to predict latent stereotype dimensions for tokens or phrases. Its outputs influence \\(B_{ij}\\) to attenuate attention weights that could reinforce negative stereotypes, quantified by a differentiable penalty integrated into the loss function to reduce bias propagation.\n\nVisual-textual cues come from a parallel image processing pipeline extracting language-specific orthographic and paralinguistic features (e.g., tone markers, script style). These features are embedded and fused with language typology embeddings to produce \\(T_{ij}\\), modulating attention towards typologically relevant context. This fusion is implemented through a cross-modal attention block preceding CLAM.\n\nTraining proceeds in a multi-task setting combining language modeling, stereotype bias reduction loss, and typological prediction objectives with weight disentanglement to ensure balanced optimization. Detailed architectural diagrams specify data flows, and formal pseudo-code describes attention weight adjustments. Implementation leverages extensible transformer frameworks compatible with mBERT variants, ensuring scalability and reproducibility.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Curation: Assemble a multilingual corpus covering >30 languages, emphasizing typological diversity (morphosyntax, phonology) and sociolinguistic aspects by integrating existing parallel corpora (e.g., Universal Dependencies, WALS) with stereotype annotations drawn from translated SCM-based social psychology surveys. Annotation protocols involve expert linguists and native speakers; inter-annotator agreement will be assessed for quality control. 2) Baseline Implementation: Train standard mBERT and a version augmented with uni-modal textual stereotype detection layers to form intermediate comparative benchmarks. 3) Prototype CLAM Development: Incrementally integrate CBEN and typology embeddings; initially validate uni-modal textual modulation before full multi-modal fusion involving image processing inputs, allowing risk mitigation. 4) Full Training and Evaluation: Train the final model end-to-end using a combination of language modeling loss, stereotype bias metrics (e.g., StereoSet score, SEAT benchmarks), and typological accuracy measures (e.g., typological feature prediction F1). 5) Downstream Task Evaluation: Assess NLI, conversational paraphrasing, and abusive language detection benchmarks incorporating culturally sensitive inputs, measuring semantic preservation and stereotype mitigation. 6) Ablation Studies: Decompose CLAM components (CBEN, typology embeddings, visual pipeline) to isolate effects and analyze learned attention patterns. 7) Resource and Stability Monitoring: Record compute time, memory usage, and training convergence statistics, employing gradient clipping and learning rate schedules to ensure robustness. Detailed timelines and resources will be outlined, including contingency plans to scale down or incrementally test components if annotation or convergence challenges arise.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "- Input: A code-switched sentence combining Turkish agglutinative morphology with Yoruba tonal pitch references containing culturally marked stereotypes (e.g., references to social roles). Expected: The model maintains semantic integrity, disambiguates ambiguous forms, and avoids stereotype reinforcement by generating neutral or culturally appropriate paraphrases.\n\n- Input: Document images of multilingual signage combining Latin and non-Latin scripts (e.g., Chinese and Arabic) with embedded typological metadata. Expected: The model successfully fuses visual orthographic cues with typological information to improve token attention weighting, preserving context and avoiding erroneous stereotypes linked to scripts or language regions.\n\n- Input: Sentences containing emotionally charged terms associated with social groups. Expected: The model’s outputs show reduced harmful bias, as measured by established sociolinguistic bias metrics, while maintaining natural and fluent language use.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the integrated CLAM framework underperforms or training proves unstable, we will revert to a simplified multi-task architecture decoupling typology prediction and stereotype bias detection as separate auxiliary tasks appended to a standard transformer backbone. Outputs will then be combined via late fusion ensemble methods. Additionally, we will incorporate explicit symbolic sociolinguistic constraint modules derived from expert-curated rules to counter bias explicitly and enforce typological consistency. This strategy allows gradual complexity increase, preserving interpretability and stability while still targeting the core research questions."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an innovative integration of cognitive-linguistic models and multi-modal inputs for enhancing LLM representations. However, the exact computational implementation details of the Cognitive-Linguistic Attention Module (CLAM), especially how it dynamically modulates token attention weights using stereotype content model outputs and typological metadata, lack clarity. Clearer mechanistic description is needed, including how visual-textual cues from document image processing concretely interface with transformer attention kernels, and how cognitive bias estimation quantitatively influences training signals. Without this, assessing the soundness and reproducibility of the approach remains difficult, and it may limit peer validation and debugging during experimentation. Consider including formal equations or architectural diagrams to illustrate data flow and attention weight adjustment logic within CLAM, as well as specifying training regimes for cognitive bias estimators distinct from language models to strengthen mechanistic transparency and grounding in cognitive theory assumptions for this highly interdisciplinary method, ensuring it is conceptually and mathematically coherent and implementable at scale within transformer frameworks like mBERT variants or beyond existing modules widely used in LLMs as baselines for comparison.  \n\nThis clarity will also help discern if integrating stereotype content model datasets potentially risks propagating biases instead of mitigating them, a critical ethical consideration here given the research motivation. Addressing this will substantially improve the scientific rigor and trustworthiness of the method's foundation, a priority as your method claims to bridge complex social-psychological and typological phenomena within a neural architecture context, which is non-trivial and novel but must be concretely supported by robust mechanisms linked to standards in both NLP model design and cognitive computational modeling literatures.  \n\n---\n\nThis is the most critical to fix before feasibility and impact can be convincingly assessed or demonstrated through experiments, ensuring the method is fully sound at its core assumptions and design behavior level.  \n\n\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The Experiment_Plan presents a logically ordered series of steps from dataset curation to ablation studies. However, it requires strengthening in practical considerations and clarity to ensure feasibility and reproducibility. First, curating a multilingual, typologically diverse dataset with stereotype and sociolinguistic annotations is highly challenging, often requiring expert knowledge and cross-disciplinary collaboration; details on dataset sources, annotation protocols, quality control, and scale are needed. Second, the plan should clearly specify evaluation metrics beyond broad categories like \"typological representation accuracy\" and \"sociolinguistic bias metrics\" — ideally choose or design benchmark metrics validated in sociolinguistics, bias measurement in NLP, and typological NLP benchmarking communities. Third, the integration of multi-modal inputs from image processing pipelines linked to language typology metadata introduces complexity. A fallback or incremental baseline strategy focusing on simpler uni-modal textual signals before full multi-modal fusion could mitigate risks, supporting development and analysis. Lastly, the plan should address computational resource demands and training stability challenges inherently present when augmenting large transformers with bespoke attention modules conditioned on complex cognitive/social data signals. Consider a more detailed timeline, resource estimate, and risk mitigation strategies related to annotation difficulties and model convergence issues. Incorporating these elements will clarify the practical pathway from concept to meaningful results, increasing the project's credibility and likelihood of success in a competitive research environment. This experimental rigor ultimately underpins validity and confidence for impact claims, especially since the novelty rating suggests substantial existing competing methods requiring strong, empirically supported differentiation.  \n\n---\n\nAddressing these issues sharply improves feasibility assessment and elevates the proposal's technical depth in line with expectations from premier conference standards."
