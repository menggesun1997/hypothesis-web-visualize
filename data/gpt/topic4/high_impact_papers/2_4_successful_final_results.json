    "title": "Psycholinguistic Style-Based Fairness Benchmark for Multilingual LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing multilingual fairness benchmarks focus on demographic parity and lack evaluation of biases in rhetorical style, cognitive load, and user comprehension, missing social-communicative dimensions of language fairness.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the novel gap of limited social and communicative bias evaluation metrics by creating a psycholinguistically grounded fairness benchmark. It combines insights from Hidden Bridges linking text output and cognitive psychology with fairness evaluation, expanding bias assessment beyond traditional statistical metrics.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a benchmark dataset and evaluation methodology indexing multilingual outputs by measures of rhetorical style bias (e.g., dominance, politeness), cognitive load appropriateness, and comprehensibility stratified by cultural contexts. Evaluation scripts will quantify disparities by social factors and correlate with human judgments. The benchmark will facilitate development of models optimized for socially aware fairness.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Design annotation schemas integrating psycholinguistic style features.\n2) Collect multilingual dataset of LLM outputs from various models.\n3) Conduct human annotations and cognitive load experiments.\n4) Create automated scoring metrics using linguistic feature extraction.\n5) Validate benchmark by correlating automatic metrics with human fairness and style assessments.\n6) Use benchmark to tune bias mitigation methods.\n7) Release as open-source benchmark suite for community adoption.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Sample input: Asking LLM for advice on gender roles in Japanese.\nEvaluation detects overly authoritative language biasing gender roles.\nBenchmark scoring indicates low fairness on rhetorical style dimension for the output.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If human annotation is expensive, implement semi-supervised labeling assisted by psycholinguistic models. Alternatively, start with a limited set of languages or styles and gradually expand."

        "title": "Psycholinguistic Style-Based Fairness Benchmark with Explainable AI Integration for Multilingual LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current multilingual fairness benchmarks predominantly focus on demographic parity and overlook biases in rhetorical style, cognitive load, and user comprehension. They lack integration of social-communicative dimensions and do not consider how these biases manifest within the internal representations of large language models (LLMs), resulting in limited insight into model behavior across languages and cultures.",
        "Motivation": "To address a critical gap, we propose a novel, psycholinguistically grounded multilingual fairness benchmark that advances beyond traditional statistical bias metrics by systematically quantifying social-communicative biases in LLM outputs, such as rhetorical style and cognitive appropriateness. By integrating state-of-the-art deep neural network interpretability methods, the benchmark links external output biases with internal model latent representations. This combined approach provides deeper insights into how LLMs encode and propagate social biases across languages and cultures, enabling more precise, interpretable, and controllable bias mitigation strategies. This interdisciplinary fusion significantly elevates novelty and impact beyond existing benchmarks, appealing broadly to NLP fairness and model interpretability research communities.",
        "Proposed_Method": "1) Define a comprehensive annotation schema grounded in psycholinguistics, specifying measurable linguistic features representing rhetorical style biases (e.g., dominance, politeness, epistemic modality), cognitive load indicators (e.g., syntactic complexity, lexical diversity), and comprehensibility metrics tailored to linguistic and cultural contexts.\n\n2) Employ multilingual linguistic resources and culturally stratified lexicons to encode cultural dimensions, ensuring feature extraction accounts for language-specific norms and social meaning, thus avoiding superficial or ethnocentric interpretations.\n\n3) Collect multilingual LLM outputs across diverse tasks and languages, systematically annotated by expert human raters for style and fairness dimensions.\n\n4) Develop computational feature extraction pipelines combining rule-based linguistic algorithms with pretrained multilingual models fine-tuned for detecting psycholinguistic constructs; validate these pipelines using correlation and regression analyses against human judgments.\n\n5) Integrate explainable AI techniques such as layer-wise relevance propagation, representation similarity analysis, and probing classifiers targeting internal embedding layers of LLMs. These methods will reveal how psycholinguistic style and bias signals are encoded internally across languages and demographic strata.\n\n6) Use advanced statistical methods (e.g., mixed-effects modeling, structural equation modeling) to correlate automated metrics and internal representation analyses with human fairness assessments, ensuring robust, interpretable evaluation.\n\n7) Demonstrate the benchmark's utility by applying it to tune bias mitigation strategies with feedback informed by both output-level and internal model-level signals.\n\n8) Release a comprehensive, open-source benchmark suite comprising annotated datasets, robust multilingual feature extractors, integrated interpretability analysis tools, and baseline tuning scripts to foster community adoption.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Step 1: Curate a multilingual set of LLM-generated texts across varied social domains and languages.\nStep 2: Develop and validate culturally stratified annotation protocols for rhetorical style and cognitive load by recruiting native-speaking psycholinguistic experts.\nStep 3: Perform human annotations and conduct controlled cognitive load experiments measuring comprehension difficulty.\nStep 4: Construct multilingual computational models to extract psycholinguistic features and validate them through correlation with human ratings.\nStep 5: Apply explainable AI techniques on the internal layers of LLMs to map feature salience related to style and bias across languages.\nStep 6: Conduct comprehensive statistical analyses to relate output-level fairness metrics and internal representation insights to human assessments.\nStep 7: Use the benchmark to guide iterative bias mitigation experiments optimizing both output fairness and internal representations.\nStep 8: Package and release the benchmark toolkit alongside thorough documentation and reproducibility guidelines.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: Requesting advice on gender roles in Japanese.\nHuman annotations flag overly authoritative and culturally incongruent language usage indicating rhetorical style bias.\nAutomated feature extraction identifies elevated dominance markers and decreased politeness cues.\nExplainability analysis reveals the model's latent embeddings over-represent dominance-related dimensions for male-associated contexts.\nBenchmark scores indicate a significant fairness deficit in style dimensions corroborated by internal model bias signals.\nThe integrated interpretability outputs enable targeted intervention in relevant model layers to reduce bias.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full-scale human annotation is cost-prohibitive, initiate semi-supervised annotation by leveraging pretrained psycholinguistic classifiers adapted for target languages, supplemented with active learning to focus human effort on ambiguous instances. Begin benchmark development with a limited but typologically diverse language subset to validate cultural stratification strategies. Incrementally incorporate explainability analyses starting from simpler probing tasks before scaling to full-layer relevance mapping, ensuring manageable complexity and early proof-of-concept validation."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks clarity on how psycholinguistic measures such as rhetorical style bias, cognitive load appropriateness, and comprehensibility will be consistently quantified and operationalized across multiple languages and cultural contexts. It would be beneficial to clearly specify the linguistic features and computational models used to extract these measures, and how cultural stratifications will be encoded and validated to ensure the benchmark meaningfully captures social-communicative dimensions rather than just surface linguistic statistics. This clarification would strengthen the soundness of the method and its feasibility for multilingual scenarios without overgeneralization or cultural bias in measurement algorithms, which is non-trivial given the complexity of psycholinguistic constructs across languages and cultures involved in large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, the way the evaluation scripts correlate these metrics to human judgments should be detailed, including statistical methods or validation procedures to ensure robustness and interpretability of fairness assessments in style dimensions beyond traditional demographic parity metrics. Addressing these points will improve confidence in the technical soundness and impact of the benchmark as a tool for developing socially aware fairness in multilingual LLMs, making the proposed approach more concrete and reproducible for the community."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment, the idea's impact and novelty could be enhanced by explicitly integrating state-of-the-art deep neural network interpretability methods and embedding-based evaluations, linking psycholinguistic style benchmarks with explainable AI techniques tailored for language models. For example, utilizing techniques that evaluate how internal model representations correlate with human-like cognitive and linguistic tasks could deepen the benchmark's relevance to understanding model biases not just at output level but at model internal levels. Integrating these approaches may also connect the social-communicative bias assessment with the model's latent representations, potentially enabling more fine-grained and controllable debiasing strategies. This alignment with globally linked concepts like 'evaluate deep neural networks' and 'human-like tasks' would broaden the benchmark's scientific contribution and encourage interdisciplinary research, appealing strongly to the broader NLP and ML interpretability communities and thus boosting impact and novelty beyond current multilingual fairness benchmarks."
