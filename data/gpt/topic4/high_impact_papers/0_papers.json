    "abstract": "As generative language models, exemplified by ChatGPT, continue to advance in their capabilities, the spotlight on biases inherent in these models intensifies. This article delves into the distinctive challenges and risks associated with biases specifically in large-scale language models. We explore the origins of biases, stemming from factors such as training data, model specifications, algorithmic constraints, product design, and policy decisions. Our examination extends to the ethical implications arising from the unintended consequences of biased model outputs. In addition, we analyze the intricacies of mitigating biases, acknowledging the inevitable persistence of some biases, and consider the consequences of deploying these models across diverse applications, including virtual assistants, content generation, and chatbots. Finally, we provide an overview of current approaches for identifying, quantifying, and mitigating biases in language models, underscoring the need for a collaborative, multidisciplinary effort to craft AI systems that embody equity, transparency, and responsibility. This article aims to catalyze a thoughtful discourse within the AI community, prompting researchers and developers to consider the unique role of biases in the domain of generative language models and the ongoing quest for ethical AI.",

    "abstract": "The Routledge Handbook of Corpus Linguistics 2e provides an updated overview of a dynamic and rapidly growing area with a widely applied methodology. Over a decade on from the first edition of the Handbook, this collection of 47 chapters from experts in key areas offers a comprehensive introduction to both the development and use of corpora as well as their ever-evolving applications to other areas, such as digital humanities, sociolinguistics, stylistics, translation studies, materials design, language teaching and teacher development, media discourse, discourse analysis, forensic linguistics, second language acquisition and testing. The new edition updates all core chapters and includes new chapters on corpus linguistics and statistics, digital humanities, translation, phonetics and phonology, second language acquisition, social media and theoretical perspectives. Chapters provide annotated further reading lists and step-by-step guides as well as detailed overviews across a wide range of themes. The Handbook also includes a wealth of case studies that draw on some of the many new corpora and corpus tools that have emerged in the last decade. Organised across four themes, moving from the basic start-up topics such as corpus building and design to analysis, application and reflection, this second edition remains a crucial point of reference for advanced undergraduates, postgraduates and scholars in applied linguistics.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to perform new tasks\nbased on a few demonstrations or natural language instructions. While these\ncapabilities have led to widespread adoption, most LLMs are developed by\nresource-rich organizations and are frequently kept from the public. As a step\ntowards democratizing this powerful technology, we present BLOOM, a\n176B-parameter open-access language model designed and built thanks to a\ncollaboration of hundreds of researchers. BLOOM is a decoder-only Transformer\nlanguage model that was trained on the ROOTS corpus, a dataset comprising\nhundreds of sources in 46 natural and 13 programming languages (59 in total).\nWe find that BLOOM achieves competitive performance on a wide variety of\nbenchmarks, with stronger results after undergoing multitask prompted\nfinetuning. To facilitate future research and applications using LLMs, we\npublicly release our models and code under the Responsible AI License.",

    "abstract": "The Encyclopedia of Social Network Analysis and Mining (ESNAM) is the first major reference work to integrate fundamental concepts and research directions in the areas of social networks and applications to data mining. The second edition of ESNAM is a truly outstanding reference appealing to researchers, practitioners, instructors and students (both undergraduate and graduate), as well as the general public. This updated reference integrates all basics concepts and research efforts under one umbrella. Coverage has been expanded to include new emerging topics such as crowdsourcing, opinion mining, and sentiment analysis. Revised content of existing material keeps the encyclopedia current. The second edition is intended for college students as well as public and academic libraries. It is anticipated to continue to stimulate more awareness of social network applications and research efforts. The advent of electronic communication, and in particular on-line communities, have created social networks of hitherto unimaginable sizes. Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of this unique field, the essential contributions of diverse disciplines, from computer science, mathematics, and statistics to sociology and behavioral science, are described among the 300 authoritative yet highly readable entries. Students will find a world of information and insight behind the familiar façade of the social networks in which they participate. Researchers and practitioners will benefit from a comprehensive perspective on the methodologies for analysis of constructed networks, and the data mining and machine learning techniques that have proved attractive for sophisticated knowledge discovery in complex applications. Also addressed is the application of social network methodologies to other domains, such as web networks and biological networks.",

    "abstract": "The Routledge Handbook of Language Policy and Planning is a comprehensive and authoritative survey, including original contributions from leading senior scholars and rising stars to provide a basis for future research in language policy and planning in international, national, regional, and local contexts. The Handbook approaches language policy as public policy that can be studied through the policy cycle framework. It offers a systematic and research-informed view of actual processes and methods of design, implementation, and evaluation. With a substantial introduction, 38 chapters and an extensive bibliography, this Handbook is an indispensable resource for all decision makers, students, and researchers of language policy and planning within linguistics and cognate disciplines such as public policy, economics, political science, sociology, and education.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven algorithms are studied and deployed in diverse domains to support critical decisions, directly impacting people’s well-being. As a result, a growing community of researchers has been investigating the equity of existing algorithms and proposing novel ones, advancing the understanding of risks and opportunities of automated decision-making for historically disadvantaged populations. Progress in fair machine learning and equitable algorithm design hinges on data, which can be appropriately used only if adequately documented. Unfortunately, the algorithmic fairness community, as a whole, suffers from a collective data documentation debt caused by a lack of information on specific resources (opacity) and scatteredness of available information (sparsity). In this work, we target this data documentation debt by surveying over two hundred datasets employed in algorithmic fairness research, and producing standardized and searchable documentation for each of them. Moreover we rigorously identify the three most popular fairness datasets, namely Adult, COMPAS, and German Credit, for which we compile in-depth documentation. This unifying documentation effort supports multiple contributions. Firstly, we summarize the merits and limitations of Adult, COMPAS, and German Credit, adding to and unifying recent scholarship, calling into question their suitability as general-purpose fairness benchmarks. Secondly, we document hundreds of available alternatives, annotating their domain and supported fairness tasks, along with additional properties of interest for fairness practitioners and researchers, including their format, cardinality, and the sensitive attributes they encode. We summarize this information, zooming in on the tasks, domains, and roles of these resources. Finally, we analyze these datasets from the perspective of five important data curation topics: anonymization, consent, inclusivity, labeling of sensitive attributes, and transparency. We discuss different approaches and levels of attention to these topics, making them tangible, and distill them into a set of best practices for the curation of novel resources.",

    "abstract": "This handbook brings together and promotes research on the area of vocational education and training (VET). It analyzes current and future economic and labor market trends and relates these to likely implications for vocational education and training. It questions how VET engages with the growing power of human development approaches and with the sustainable development agenda. Equity and inclusion are discussed in a range of ways by the authors and the consideration of the construction of these terms is an important element of the handbook. It further addresses both the overall notion of system reform, at different scales, and what is known about particular technologies of systems reform across a variety of settings. Vocational learning and VET teacher/trainer education are discussed from a comparative perspective. National and comparative experiences are also shared on questions of equity and efficiency in funding in terms of those that fund and are funded, and for a range of funding methodologies. As well as reviewing existing gaps, this handbook is looking forward in identifying promising new directions in research and environment.

    "abstract": "Qualitative research is growing in Asia and globally. In an Asian context, this requires an awareness of a completely different set of norms, practices, and expectations than those covered by books from a western perspective. This handbook truly celebrates these differences. Spanning the full research process, from philosophy and ethics to design and methods and through data collection, management, analysis, and dissemination, it focuses specifically on the practicalities needed to conduct effective and culturally responsive research in the Asian context. This handbook extends beyond researchers actually in Asia and also speaks to researchers working with Asian participants, researching in Asian immigrant neighbourhoods, and studying the larger global topics like socioeconomic challenges, climate change, or technological advancement. This is the first book to focus specifically on qualitative research in the Asian context and includes diverse contributors from Asia such as the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, India, Oman, China, South Korea, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Hong Kong, and from other continents such as North America, South America, Africa, Europe, and Oceania. Section 1: Foundations of Qualitative Research in Asia; Section 2: Qualitative Research Designs; Section 3: Best Practices in Dealing with Qualitative Research Data; and Section 4: Other Qualitative Research Topics.",

    "title": "Cross-lingual Sentiment Analysis of Tamil Language Using a Multi-stage Deep Learning Architecture",
    "year": 2023,
    "citationCount": 11,
    "fieldCitationRatio": 21.94,
    "abstract": "In recent years, sentiment analysis has become a focal point in natural language processing. Cross-lingual sentiment analysis is a particularly demanding yet essential task that seeks to construct models capable of effectively analyzing sentiments across a variety of languages. The primary motivation behind this research is to bridge the gap in current techniques that often struggle to perform well with low-resource languages, due to the scarcity of large, annotated datasets, and their unique linguistic characteristics. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-Stage Deep Learning Architecture (MSDLA) for cross-lingual sentiment analysis of the Tamil language, a low-resource language. Our approach utilizes transfer learning from a source language with abundant resources to overcome data limitations. Our proposed model significantly outperforms existing methods on the Tamil Movie Review dataset, achieving an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.8772, 0.8614, 0.8825, and 0.8718, respectively. ANOVA statistical comparison demonstrates that the MSDLA’s improvements over other models, including mT5, XLM, mBERT, ULMFiT, BiLSTM, LSTM with Attention, and ALBERT with Hugging Face English Embedding are significant, with p-values all less than 0.005. Ablation studies confirm the importance of both cross-lingual semantic attention and domain adaptation in our architecture. Without these components, the model’s performance drops to 0.8342 and 0.8043 in accuracy, respectively. Furthermore, MSDLA demonstrates robust cross-domain performance on the Tamil News Classification and Thirukkural datasets, achieving an accuracy of 0.8551 and 0.8624, respectively, significantly outperforming the baseline models. These findings illustrate the robustness and efficacy of our approach, making a significant contribution to cross-lingual sentiment analysis techniques, especially for low-resource languages.",
