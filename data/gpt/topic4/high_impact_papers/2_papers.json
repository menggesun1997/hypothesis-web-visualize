    "abstract": "In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and\nbenchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on\na specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method\nstill requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of\nthousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language\ntask from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which\ncurrent NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up\nlanguage models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes\neven reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning\napproaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with\n175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model,\nand test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is\napplied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot\ndemonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3\nachieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,\nquestion-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require\non-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a\nnovel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time,\nwe also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles,\nas well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to\ntraining on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples\nof news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from\narticles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding\nand of GPT-3 in general.",

    "abstract": "Forecasting has always been at the forefront of decision making and planning. The uncertainty that surrounds the future is both exciting and challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise risks and maximise utilities. The large number of forecasting applications calls for a diverse set of forecasting methods to tackle real-life challenges. This article provides a non-systematic review of the theory and the practice of forecasting. We provide an overview of a wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles, and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety of real-life contexts. We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and applications. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of forecasting theory and practice. Given its encyclopedic nature, the intended mode of reading is non-linear. We offer cross-references to allow the readers to navigate through the various topics. We complement the theoretical concepts and applications covered by large lists of free or open-source software implementations and publicly-available databases.",

    "abstract": "With the prevalence of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and the pre-training–fine-tuning paradigm, it has been continuously shown that larger models tend to yield better performance. However, as PLMs scale up, fine-tuning and storing all the parameters is prohibitively costly and eventually becomes practically infeasible. This necessitates a new branch of research focusing on the parameter-efficient adaptation of PLMs, which optimizes a small portion of the model parameters while keeping the rest fixed, drastically cutting down computation and storage costs. In general, it demonstrates that large-scale models could be effectively stimulated by the optimization of a few parameters. Despite the various designs, here we discuss and analyse the approaches under a more consistent and accessible term ‘delta-tuning’, where ‘delta’ a mathematical notation often used to denote changes, is borrowed to refer to the portion of parameters that are ‘changed’ during training. We formally describe the problem and propose a unified categorization criterion for existing delta-tuning methods to explore their correlations and differences. We also discuss the theoretical principles underlying the effectiveness of delta-tuning and interpret them from the perspectives of optimization and optimal control. Furthermore, we provide a holistic empirical study on over 100 natural language processing tasks and investigate various aspects of delta-tuning. With comprehensive study and analysis, our research demonstrates the theoretical and practical properties of delta-tuning in the adaptation of PLMs.",

    "abstract": "The potential for machine learning (ML) systems to amplify social inequities and unfairness is receiving increasing popular and academic attention. A surge of recent work has focused on the development of algorithmic tools to assess and mitigate such unfairness. If these tools are to have a positive impact on industry practice, however, it is crucial that their design be informed by an understanding of real-world needs. Through 35 semi-structured interviews and an anonymous survey of 267 ML practitioners, we conduct the first systematic investigation of commercial product teams' challenges and needs for support in developing fairer ML systems. We identify areas of alignment and disconnect between the challenges faced by teams in practice and the solutions proposed in the fair ML research literature. Based on these findings, we highlight directions for future ML and HCI research that will better address practitioners' needs.",

    "abstract": "Finetuning language models on a collection of datasets phrased as\ninstructions has been shown to improve model performance and generalization to\nunseen tasks. In this paper we explore instruction finetuning with a particular\nfocus on (1) scaling the number of tasks, (2) scaling the model size, and (3)\nfinetuning on chain-of-thought data. We find that instruction finetuning with\nthe above aspects dramatically improves performance on a variety of model\nclasses (PaLM, T5, U-PaLM), prompting setups (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT), and\nevaluation benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, TyDiQA, MGSM, open-ended generation). For\ninstance, Flan-PaLM 540B instruction-finetuned on 1.8K tasks outperforms PALM\n540B by a large margin (+9.4% on average). Flan-PaLM 540B achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, such as 75.2% on five-shot\nMMLU. We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints, which achieve strong\nfew-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B.\nOverall, instruction finetuning is a general method for improving the\nperformance and usability of pretrained language models.",

    "abstract": "Making language models bigger does not inherently make them better at\nfollowing a user's intent. For example, large language models can generate\noutputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other\nwords, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an\navenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks\nby fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written\nprompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of\nlabeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune\nGPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model\noutputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using\nreinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models\nInstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the\n1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3,\ndespite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show\nimprovements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while\nhaving minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though\nInstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with\nhuman feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human\nintent.",

    "abstract": "The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out to improve the quality of life of people in developed, emerging, and developing countries by covering social and economic aspects, with a focus on environmental sustainability. At the same time, data-driven technologies influence our lives in all areas and have caused fundamental economical and societal changes. This study presents a comprehensive literature review on how data-driven approaches have enabled or inhibited the successful achievement of the 17 SDGs to date. Our findings show that data-driven analytics and tools contribute to achieving the 17 SDGs, e.g., by making information more reliable, supporting better-informed decision-making, implementing data-based policies, prioritizing actions, and optimizing the allocation of resources. Based on a qualitative content analysis, results were aggregated into a conceptual framework, including the following categories: (1) uses of data-driven methods (e.g., monitoring, measurement, mapping or modeling, forecasting, risk assessment, and planning purposes), (2) resulting positive effects, (3) arising challenges, and (4) recommendations for action to overcome these challenges. Despite positive effects and versatile applications, problems such as data gaps, data biases, high energy consumption of computational resources, ethical concerns, privacy, ownership, and security issues stand in the way of achieving the 17 SDGs.",

    "year": 2021,

    "fieldCitationRatio": 108.62,
    "abstract": "AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., BERT,\nDALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a\nwide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to\nunderscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report\nprovides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation\nmodels, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics,\nreasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model\narchitectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation,\ntheory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal\nimpact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and\nethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep\nlearning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent\ncapabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes\nhomogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution,\nas the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models\ndownstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models,\nwe currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and\nwhat they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these\nquestions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will\nrequire deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their\nfundamentally sociotechnical nature.",
