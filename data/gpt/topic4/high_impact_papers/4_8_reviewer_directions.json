    "title": "Multi-Agent Human-AI Coordination Protocols for Linguistically Diverse LLM Adaptation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM adaptation methods do not adequately model or support multi-role human-AI teams interacting across different languages with varying expertise, leading to fragile deployments.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap regarding human-AI team dynamics drawn from healthcare systems by formalizing multi-agent coordination protocols to enhance sociotechnical robustness in linguistically diverse settings per Opportunity 1.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop multi-agent interaction frameworks where adapted LLMs act as AI agents collaborating with multilingual human experts via defined protocols inspired by healthcare teamwork. Model communication, task delegation, and feedback loops explicitly to improve model adaptation and decision quality. Incorporate language translation and domain-specific knowledge transfer among agents.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Define tasks requiring team collaboration and multilingual communication.\n2) Simulate multi-agent human-AI teams with different language capabilities.\n3) Measure coordination efficiency, decision accuracy, and resource use.\n4) Conduct pilot deployments in relevant multilingual scenarios.\n5) Compare with single-agent or loosely coupled models.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "In a disaster relief scenario, an AI agent supporting logistics teams fluent in Swahili and English coordinates tasks and communicates updates, reducing errors caused by language barriers and improving response times.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If full multi-agent coordination proves complex, develop pairwise human-AI interaction modules with fallback protocols. Alternatively, simplify by focusing on two primary languages initially."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a promising multi-agent interaction framework inspired by healthcare teamwork; however, it lacks detailed clarity on how communication protocols among linguistically diverse human and AI agents are operationalized and validated. The mechanism for language translation interfacing with domain knowledge transfer needs explicit definition, including the structure of feedback loops and error handling in multilingual contexts. Providing a more formalized model or algorithmic outline would strengthen the method's soundness and reproducibility potential, ensuring the approach is well-founded and practically implementable in complex real-world scenarios such as disaster relief or healthcare settings to prevent fragile deployments as stated in the problem statement. Consider specifying how agents negotiate task allocation and resolve conflicts linguistically and semantically within the proposed protocols to improve transparency and robustness of the multi-agent coordination process in multi-language settings. This would substantially bolster the core methodological contribution's clarity and validity as well as facilitate targeted evaluations in experiments or pilot studies that follow. Details on measuring and improving sociotechnical robustness through these protocols would also enhance the proposed mechanism's soundness assessment. Target Section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is logically structured but requires further elaboration to ensure scientific rigor and practical feasibility. Specifically, simulation phases should clearly define metrics for coordination efficiency, decision accuracy, and resource utilization â€” including how linguistic diversity quantitatively impacts these measures. Details on simulating realistic human roles with different language proficiencies and expertise levels must be provided to avoid oversimplified assumptions. The plan's transition from simulation to pilot deployment in multilingual settings needs clear scalability and ethical considerations, including data collection permissions and participant sourcing strategies in diverse communities. Moreover, fallback strategies are mentioned but require concrete experimental contingencies to test their effectiveness systematically if the full multi-agent system proves too complex. Strengthening these aspects will confirm that the experimentation can realistically and conclusively demonstrate the benefit of the coordination protocols over single-agent baselines, thus proving feasibility and robustness before broader deployment.
