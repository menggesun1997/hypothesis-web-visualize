        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM adaptations struggle with resource inefficiency and failures in delivering accurate, context-aware support across linguistically diverse clinical environments. There is a need for adaptive interfaces that better integrate human-AI collaboration in multilingual healthcare scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the critical internal gap of resource inefficiency and the external gap of the missed integration of human-AI team dynamics from healthcare systems into LLM adaptation. Leverages Opportunity 1 by designing socio-technical co-adaptive LLM frameworks for linguistically heterogeneous healthcare contexts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a human-in-the-loop co-adaptive LLM system that dynamically adjusts language model outputs based on clinician feedback and contextual cues in multiple languages. Incorporate decision support system frameworks from healthcare informatics to build interactive interfaces that allow users to correct and guide model predictions, enabling the LLM to fine-tune efficiently with minimal data. Employ multilingual embeddings and continual learning with interpretable feedback loops.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multilingual clinical dialogue and decision support datasets spanning high and low-resource languages. 2) Implement baseline LLM fine-tuning with static datasets. 3) Develop interactive co-adaptive training pipelines incorporating clinician-in-the-loop feedback. 4) Metrics include clinical accuracy, response time, user satisfaction, and resource utilization. 5) Compare with static fine-tuned models and non-adaptive baselines.",

        "Fallback_Plan": "If human-in-the-loop adaptation is slow or ineffective, pivot to synthetic feedback generation simulating clinician corrections. Alternatively, focus on building a lightweight specialized multilingual adapter module optimized via meta-learning to reduce resource usage without interaction."
