    "title": "Multimodal Cognitive Bias Attribution in Multilingual LLMs Using Explainable Pragmatic Features",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current bias mitigation methods lack interpretability and do not adequately integrate multimodal (text plus visual/contextual) information, limiting detection of nuanced biases in multilingual environments.",
    "Motivation": "Combines internal gap on interpretability with thematic multimodal capabilities (from B1, B2) and cognitive pragmatics (Hidden Bridge in C) to generate an explainability-driven bias attribution framework. This fusion breaks new ground in bias understanding across language-modalities with explanatory pragmatics clues.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a bias attribution framework that inputs multilingual text and associated contextual modalities (images, metadata) into a joint model extracting pragmatic features linked to bias patterns. Employ explainable AI techniques to highlight multimodal cues contributing to biased outputs. Develop attribution maps relating linguistic pragmatics and visual biases. The system will support downstream bias mitigation by pinpointing semantic-pragmatic and multimodal bias sources.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble multimodal multilingual datasets with bias annotations.\n2) Build joint multimodal-pragmatic feature extractor.\n3) Integrate with explainability models (e.g., attention visualization).\n4) Compare bias attribution quality and interpretability vs unimodal baselines.\n5) Deploy mitigation experiments where attribution guides correction.\n6) Evaluate improvements in fairness and transparency.\n7) Conduct user studies with AI ethicists and practitioners.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: News article image + Spanish text mentioning ethnic groups.\nOutput: Attribution map highlights specific image elements and linguistic constructs contributing to ethnic bias, aiding targeted mitigation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If joint multimodal modeling proves unstable, separate unimodal pragmatic and visual bias detectors with a late fusion attribution mechanism. Alternatively, simulate case studies to inform model redesign."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines relevant stages but lacks critical details regarding dataset sourcing, annotation quality, and model evaluation metrics. The assembly of multimodal multilingual datasets with reliable bias annotations is highly challenging and needs a concrete plan to ensure data diversity and annotation consistency, especially across languages and cultures. Further, the integration of explainability methods should specify which techniques will be used beyond generic attention visualization and how interpretability will be quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. Without more precision, feasibility in building a stable joint multimodal-pragmatic model and meaningful attribution maps remains an open question. Strengthening the experiment plan with concrete benchmarks, dataset sources or creation protocols, and robust evaluation criteria is essential for practical feasibility and scientific rigor in this complex space. This will also clarify efforts needed for downstream mitigation and user studies with ethicists/practitioners, ensuring the claimed interpretability and impact can be demonstrated effectively in the experiments and deployments proposed. Please enhance the experiment plan accordingly to improve feasibility and reproducibility assumptions. (Target section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)\"},{\"feedback_code\":\"SOU-ASSUMPTION\",\"feedback_content\":\"The central assumption that integrating multimodal pragmatic features with explainable AI techniques will lead to reliable and interpretable bias attribution in multilingual contexts needs stronger foundational support. The framework assumes that pragmatic features can be effectively extracted and meaningfully aligned across diverse modalities (text, images, metadata) and languages, which presents complex cross-linguistic and cultural challenges. Additionally, the assumption that explainability methods (e.g., attention visualization) can reveal precise visual and linguistic bias cues without significant noise or misinterpretation requires validation or preliminary evidence. The proposal would benefit from a clearer articulation of the theoretical grounding or pilot analyses supporting these core assumptions, as well as identification of potential confounders such as modality dominance or feature entanglement that might undermine interpretability. Strengthening this theoretical base will improve the soundness and credibility of the proposed method and guide realistic expectations on performance and impact.
