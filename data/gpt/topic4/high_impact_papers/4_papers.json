    "abstract": "AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., BERT,\nDALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a\nwide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to\nunderscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report\nprovides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation\nmodels, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics,\nreasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model\narchitectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation,\ntheory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal\nimpact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and\nethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep\nlearning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent\ncapabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes\nhomogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution,\nas the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models\ndownstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models,\nwe currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and\nwhat they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these\nquestions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will\nrequire deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their\nfundamentally sociotechnical nature.",

    "year": 2007,
    "citationCount": 363,
    "fieldCitationRatio": 82.93,
    "abstract": "Following the increase in of the information available on the Web, the diversity of its users and the complexity of Web applications, researchers started developing adaptive Web systems that tailored their appearance and behavior to each individual user or user group. Adaptive systems were designed for different usage contexts, exploring different kinds of personalization. Web personalization has evolved into a large research field attracting scientists from different communities such as hypertext, user modeling, machine learning, natural language generation, information retrieval, intelligent tutoring systems, cognitive science, and Web-based education. This state-of-the-art survey provides a systematic overview of the ideas and techniques of the adaptive Web and serves as a central source of information for researchers, practitioners, and students. The volume constitutes a comprehensive and carefully planned collection of chapters, mapping out the most important areas of the adaptive Web, each solicited from experts and leaders in the field. The largest part of the book focuses on personalization techniques, namely the modeling side of personalization (Chaps. 1-5), and on adaptation, (Chaps. 6-14). The technique-focused part is complemented by four domain-oriented chapters in the third section of the book (Chaps. 15-18). The last section is devoted to recently emerging topics; it provides a prospective view of the new ideas and techniques that are moving rapidly into the focus of the adaptive Web community and gives the reader a glimpse into the not-so-distant future.",

    "abstract": "Over the past century, educational psychologists and researchers have posited many theories to explain how individuals learn, i.e. how they acquire, organize and deploy knowledge and skills. The 20th century can be considered the century of psychology on learning and related fields of interest (such as motivation, cognition, metacognition etc.) and it is fascinating to see the various mainstreams of learning, remembered and forgotten over the 20th century and note that basic assumptions of early theories survived several paradigm shifts of psychology and epistemology. Beyond folk psychology and its naïve theories of learning, psychological learning theories can be grouped into some basic categories, such as behaviorist learning theories, connectionist learning theories, cognitive learning theories, constructivist learning theories, and social learning theories. Learning theories are not limited to psychology and related fields of interest but rather we can find the topic of learning in various disciplines, such as philosophy and epistemology, education, information science, biology, and – as a result of the emergence of computer technologies – especially also in the field of computer sciences and artificial intelligence. As a consequence, machine learning struck a chord in the 1980s and became an important field of the learning sciences in general. As the learning sciences became more specialized and complex, the various fields of interest were widely spread and separated from each other; as a consequence, even presently, there is no comprehensive overview of the sciences of learning or the central theoretical concepts and vocabulary on which researchers rely.   The Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning provides an up-to-date, broad and authoritative coverage of the specific terms mostly used in the sciences of learning and its related fields, including relevant areas of instruction,pedagogy, cognitive sciences, and especially machine learning and knowledge engineering. This modern compendium will be an indispensable source of information for scientists, educators, engineers, and technical staff active in all fields of learning. More specifically, the Encyclopedia  provides fast access to the most relevant theoretical terms provides up-to-date, broad and authoritative coverage of the most important theories within the various fields of the learning sciences and adjacent sciences and communication technologies; supplies clear and precise explanations of the theoretical terms, cross-references to related entries and up-to-date references to important research and publications. The Encyclopedia also contains biographical entries of individuals who have substantially contributed to the sciences of learning; the entries are written by a distinguished panel of researchers in the various fields of the learning sciences.",

    "abstract": "This monograph surveys vision-language pre-training (VLP) methods for multimodal intelligence that have been developed in the last few years. We group these approaches into three categories: (i) VLP for image-text tasks, such as image captioning, image-text retrieval, visual question answering, and visual grounding; (ii) VLP for core computer vision tasks, such as (open-set) image classification, object detection, and segmentation; and (iii) VLP for video-text tasks, such as video captioning, video-text retrieval, and video question answering. For each category, we present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art methods, and discuss the progress that has been made and challenges still being faced, using specific systems and models as case studies. In addition, for each category, we discuss advanced topics being actively explored in the research community, such as big foundation models, unified modeling, in-context few-shot learning, knowledge, robustness, and computer vision in the wild, to name a few.",

    "year": 2016,

    "fieldCitationRatio": 40.05,
    "abstract": "Physics underlies all complexity, including our own existence: how is this possible? How can our own lives emerge from interactions of electrons, protons, and neutrons? This book considers the interaction of physical and non-physical causation in complex systems such as living beings, and in particular in the human brain, relating this to the emergence of higher levels of complexity with real causal powers. In particular it explores the idea of top-down causation, which is the key effect allowing the emergence of true complexity and also enables the causal efficacy of non-physical entities, including the value of money, social conventions, and ethical choices.",

    "abstract": "This inaugural handbook documents the distinctive research field that utilizes history and philosophy in investigation of theoretical, curricular and pedagogical issues in the teaching of science and mathematics. It is contributed to by 130 researchers from 30 countries; it provides a logically structured, fully referenced guide to the ways in which science and mathematics education is,   informed by the history and philosophy of these disciplines, as well as by the philosophy of education more generally. The first handbook to cover the field, it lays down a much-needed marker of progress to date and provides a platform for informed and coherent future analysis and research of the subject. The publication comes at a time of heightened worldwide concern over the standard of science and mathematics education, attended by fierce debate over how best to reform curricula and enliven student engagement in the subjects There is a growing recognition among educators and policy makersthat the learning of science must dovetail with learning about science; this handbook is uniquely positioned as a locus for the discussion. The handbook features sections on pedagogical, theoretical, national, and biographical research, setting the literature of each tradition in its historical context. Each chapter engages in an assessment of the strengths and weakness of the research addressed, and suggests potentially fruitful avenues of future research. A key element of the handbook’s broader analytical framework is its identification and examination of unnoticed philosophical assumptions in science and mathematics research. It reminds readers at a crucial juncture that there has been a long and rich tradition of historical and philosophical engagements with science and mathematics teaching, and that lessons can be learnt from these engagements for the resolution of current theoretical, curricular and pedagogical questions that face teachers and administrators.",

    "abstract": "A paper widely read 20 years ago concluded with the advice to design a word processor by analogy to something familiar to everyone: a typewriter. Even then, one of my Danish students questioned this reading assignment noting that “the typewriter is a species on its last legs.” For most of the computing era, interaction involved 80-column punch cards, paper tape, line editors, 1920-character displays, 1-megabyte diskettes, and other extinct species. Are the interaction issues of those times relevant today? No.",
