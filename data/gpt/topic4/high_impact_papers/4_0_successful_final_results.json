    "title": "Interactive Co-Adaptive LLMs for Multilingual Clinical Decision Support",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM adaptations struggle with resource inefficiency and failures in delivering accurate, context-aware support across linguistically diverse clinical environments. There is a need for adaptive interfaces that better integrate human-AI collaboration in multilingual healthcare scenarios.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical internal gap of resource inefficiency and the external gap of the missed integration of human-AI team dynamics from healthcare systems into LLM adaptation. Leverages Opportunity 1 by designing socio-technical co-adaptive LLM frameworks for linguistically heterogeneous healthcare contexts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a human-in-the-loop co-adaptive LLM system that dynamically adjusts language model outputs based on clinician feedback and contextual cues in multiple languages. Incorporate decision support system frameworks from healthcare informatics to build interactive interfaces that allow users to correct and guide model predictions, enabling the LLM to fine-tune efficiently with minimal data. Employ multilingual embeddings and continual learning with interpretable feedback loops.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multilingual clinical dialogue and decision support datasets spanning high and low-resource languages. 2) Implement baseline LLM fine-tuning with static datasets. 3) Develop interactive co-adaptive training pipelines incorporating clinician-in-the-loop feedback. 4) Metrics include clinical accuracy, response time, user satisfaction, and resource utilization. 5) Compare with static fine-tuned models and non-adaptive baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A diagnostic query in Amharic about patient symptoms with incomplete data.\nOutput: An interactive LLM-assisted decision support system generates diagnostic hypotheses, requests clarifying questions from clinician in Amharic, and updates recommendations dynamically based on responses, reflecting regionally relevant clinical knowledge.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If human-in-the-loop adaptation is slow or ineffective, pivot to synthetic feedback generation simulating clinician corrections. Alternatively, focus on building a lightweight specialized multilingual adapter module optimized via meta-learning to reduce resource usage without interaction."

        "title": "Interactive Co-Adaptive LLMs for Multilingual Clinical Decision Support with Collaborative Protocols and Interpretable Feedback Mechanisms",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM adaptations for clinical decision support frequently encounter challenges including resource inefficiency, limited interpretability, and inadequate integration of human-AI collaboration especially across linguistically diverse healthcare settings. There is an unmet need for robust, co-adaptive systems that enable seamless, interpretable collaboration between clinicians and AI across multiple languages, while preserving prior knowledge and ensuring contextual accuracy in resource-constrained environments.",
        "Motivation": "While human-in-the-loop multilingual clinical support with LLMs has been explored, current approaches often lack formal mechanisms to model clinician-AI collaboration dynamics and struggle to balance continual adaptation with model stability and interpretability. This proposal addresses these gaps by embedding principles from human-computer interaction theory and collaboration protocols directly into the co-adaptive framework. By formalizing interaction protocols and interpretability methods, the work transcends incremental improvements, offering a socio-technical co-adaptive system that dynamically evolves with clinical teams over time. This integration enhances novelty by coupling advanced AI adaptation with validated multi-agent communication and generational intelligence concepts, positioning the research at the interface of clinical NLP, HCI, and AI agents.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel architecture combining multilingual LLMs with a layered socio-technical co-adaptive system guided by explicit collaboration protocols inspired by human-computer interaction theory and agent communication languages (ACLs). The core components include: 1) An interaction protocol module encoding structured communicative acts (e.g., requests, clarifications, confirmations) enabling transparent clinician-LLM dialogue cycles facilitating interpretable feedback and mutual adaptation. 2) A continual learning framework with differentiated update paths ensuring preservation of prior knowledge via constrained optimization and replay buffers, minimizing catastrophic forgetting across languages and clinical contexts. 3) A multi-modal feedback interpreter that converts natural language and structured clinician inputs into interpretable model adjustments using attention-based alignment and embedding projection for multilingual consistency. 4) Integration of generational intelligence concepts to model and support evolving clinical team knowledge and long-term adaptation dynamics across sessions and users. 5) A real-time dashboard visualizing model confidence, adaptation history, and collaborative dialogue state to enhance clinician trust and user engagement. This architecture is formalized through a schematic interaction protocol representing message flows, states, and adaptation triggers, operationalized in a software engineering framework optimized for resource-constrained multilingual healthcare environments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate and preprocess a multilingual clinical dialogue dataset across high and low-resource languages with annotations of interaction acts and corrections. 2) Implement baseline static fine-tuned multilingual LLMs for clinical decision support. 3) Develop and deploy the co-adaptive system with explicit collaboration protocols and interpretable feedback pipelines. 4) Conduct user studies with clinicians simulating realistic diagnostic workflows; collect multi-modal feedback data. 5) Evaluate on metrics spanning clinical diagnostic accuracy, resource utilization, response latency, and collaboration quality (e.g., mutual adaptation index, interpretability scores, user engagement surveys). 6) Perform ablation studies isolating effects of the interaction protocol, continual learning module, and dashboard visualization. 7) Compare performance against static and non-cooperative baselines.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinician inputs incomplete symptom description in Amharic; LLM generates initial diagnostic hypotheses and requests clarifying questions using the interaction protocol (e.g., 'Could you specify the duration of the symptom?'). Clinician responds via structured dialogue acts. The system interprets feedback, updates hypotheses while preserving prior model knowledge. The dashboard visualizes adaptation measures and confidence to the clinician in Amharic. Output: Dynamically refined, context-sensitive diagnostic support with transparent rationale and multi-turn cooperative dialogue promoting clinician-AI mutual learning, producing regionally contextualized, linguistically accurate guidance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time co-adaptation proves insufficiently responsive or introduces instability, we will fallback to an offline simulated feedback pipeline leveraging synthetic clinician corrections informed by historical data to guide lightweight adapter modules optimized via meta-learning. This retains multilingual support and interpretability features while reducing the complexity of live interactions. Additionally, we will explore reducing the interaction protocol complexity by focusing on a minimal viable set of communicative acts to streamline adaptation without compromising robustness."

Clarify the concrete architectural or algorithmic design mechanisms that enable real-time co-adaptation, how conflicting feedback across languages or clinical contexts will be resolved, and the extent to which the model adapts without drifting or losing prior knowledge. This clarity is critical to ensure soundness and reproducibility of the approach. Consider including a schematic or formal framework describing the interaction protocol between clinicians and the LLM within the co-adaptive system to strengthen the method's soundness and implementation feasibility assumptions in diverse, resource-constrained multilingual healthcare environments. This will also address potential challenges underlying your core method assumptions and provide confidence in your proposed solution's robustness across heterogeneous contexts. Targeted elaboration on these aspects will substantially improve the internal validity and soundness of the proposal's methodological core.\n\n(Section: Proposed_Method)\";\"feedback_code\":\"SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION\",\"feedback_content\":\"Given the novelty verdict as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the focus on human-in-the-loop co-adaptive LLMs in multilingual clinical support, the idea could be significantly enhanced by integrating concepts from 'human-computer interaction theory' and 'collaboration protocols'. Specifically, incorporating validated HCI collaborative frameworks or agent communication protocols could deepen the socio-technical co-adaptation aspect and improve model interpretability and user engagement. Exploring how generational intelligence might inform adaptive learning over time in such clinical teams could also broaden and deepen impact while differentiating the work. Embedding these globally linked concepts into the design and evaluation metrics (e.g., measuring collaboration quality or mutual adaptation dynamics) can provide a richer, multi-dimensional assessment of effectiveness beyond accuracy and resource use. This would elevate your competitiveness and impact in the human-AI interaction community as well as clinical NLP, potentially creating new interdisciplinary research avenues and stronger adoption rationale.\"}]}]}"
