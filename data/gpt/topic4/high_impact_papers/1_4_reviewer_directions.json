    "title": "Typology-Enhanced Visual-Linguistic LLM Training via Rhetorical Device Modeling",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM training methods often ignore the influence of rhetorical devices linked to linguistic typology and cognitive persuasion theories, limiting diversity representation and sociocultural contextualization.",
    "Motivation": "Exploits the hidden bridge between image processing and social psychology framed rhetorical devices to enrich LLM training by modeling rhetorical patterns typologically informed, addressing bias and enhancing nuanced sociolinguistic representation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a training paradigm incorporating rhetorical device detectors trained on multimodal document images capturing visual-textual cues (layout, typography, imagery) and language typological features. Use these detectors to annotate large corpora, then fine-tune LLMs with multi-task loss to jointly predict text and rhetorical device structures, enabling awareness of persuasive linguistic forms across diverse typologies and social contexts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Annotate multimodal datasets for rhetorical devices spanning typologically diverse languages. 2) Train detectors linking visual and linguistic features. 3) Fine-tune LLMs with combined language modeling and rhetorical device prediction objectives. 4) Evaluate on rhetorical device recognition, multilingual persuasion tasks, and bias reduction benchmarks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A political speech document image in a polysynthetic language with embedded metaphors and cultural rhetorical devices. Expected Output: LLM-generated summaries capturing rhetorical nuances and culturally sensitive language variation without stereotype reinforcement.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "Should joint training underperform, isolate rhetorical device modeling as a preprocessing step feeding enhanced embeddings to standard LLM fine-tuning pipelines."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-MECHANISM",
          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a multi-modal approach incorporating visual and linguistic features to detect rhetorical devices and integrate them into LLM training via a multi-task loss. However, the mechanism lacks clarity in several respects: (1) how exactly typological features from diverse languages will be represented and incorporated jointly with visual cues; (2) the feasibility of training reliable multimodal rhetorical device detectors given the complexity and cultural specificity of rhetorical devices; and (3) how persuasive cognitive theories concretely map onto model architectures or learning objectives. To improve soundness, clarify the model architectures, feature fusion strategies, and provide preliminary hypotheses or pilot results demonstrating detector effectiveness across typologies and modalities. Explicitly specify how multimodal signals and typological metadata are fused and utilized in fine-tuning the LLM to ensure the claims are mechanistically plausible and well-founded. This clarification is essential before committing to the complex multi-modal multi-task training paradigm proposed. Targeting this will strengthen the method's theoretical grounding and convince reviewers of its internal coherence and viability within the competitive area noted in the novelty assessment, reducing risk of unclear or impractical methodology critiques."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the interdisciplinary nature of the research idea, integrating insights and resources from linked global concepts could significantly enhance impact and differentiation. Specifically, leveraging \"corpus linguistics\" and \"cultural heritage preservation\" can provide rich, diverse, and well-annotated multilingual corpora imbued with sociocultural nuances and rhetorical markers. Further, connecting with \"automated essay evaluation\" and \"enhance educational practices\" domains can expand downstream applications beyond summarization into formative assessment and language education, especially for minority or heritage language contexts. This integration would broaden the scope of impact, introduce new evaluation scenarios, and position the work as a bridge between NLP, language education, and cultural preservation, thus elevating its novelty and societal relevance. To implement, the authors could seek partnerships with corpora and educational datasets explicitly annotated for rhetorical and cultural features and propose evaluation tasks aligned with educational and heritage preservation goals alongside current persuasion and bias benchmarks."
