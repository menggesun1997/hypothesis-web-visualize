    "title": "Ethical and Impact-Sensitive Multilingual LLM Evaluation Pipeline",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing multilingual LLM evaluation pipelines lack integration of ethical considerations and societal impact assessments, particularly for languages marginalized in AI governance frameworks.",
    "Motivation": "Responding to Opportunity 3, this project fills the novel gap linking ethical AI with digital health and policy frameworks by embedding humanities-driven ethical evaluation into multilingual LLM assessment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an evaluation pipeline embedding multi-dimensional ethical metrics including fairness, health literacy impact, and compliance with emerging AI regulatory frameworks (e.g., AI Act). The pipeline leverages interdisciplinary input from digital humanities, legal studies, and public health experts to interpret LLM outputs in diverse languages and contexts. It incorporates domain-specific tests such as mental health chatbot interactions and policy-sensitive text generation, generating transparent ethical evaluation reports.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Define ethical evaluation criteria guided by humanities and legal scholars.\n2. Assemble evaluation datasets spanning health literacy, mental health dialogue, and policy texts in underrepresented languages.\n3. Develop metrics capturing fairness, harm risk, transparency, and regulatory alignment.\n4. Implement multilingual LLM evaluation pipeline integrating these metrics.\n5. Test pipeline on existing LLMs and analyze output diversity and ethical risks.\n6. Collaborate with community stakeholders for validation and feedback.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Prompt: Generate mental health support message in Wolof for users with specific cultural idioms.\nExpected Output: A message demonstrating culturally sensitive, non-stigmatizing language, evaluated for ethical compliance and health literacy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If comprehensive regulatory frameworks are unavailable, fallback on best-practice ethical guidelines from WHO and ethics boards. Alternatively, simplify pipeline to focus on fairness and harm reduction metrics initially."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks specificity regarding the sourcing and validation of underrepresented language datasets, which is critical for feasibility. The plan should explicitly address how to acquire high-quality, culturally diverse datasets in marginalized languages, including potential partnerships or data augmentation strategies. Additionally, clearer criteria for selecting interdisciplinary experts and concrete methods for quantifying complex ethical metrics like fairness and harm risk across languages would strengthen the scientific rigor and practical execution of the pipeline. Without these details, the plan risks being overly ambitious and difficult to replicate or validate reliably in such diverse contexts, potentially limiting the feasibility of the proposed methodology at scale or in resource-limited settings. Providing more granular milestones or piloting phases (e.g., initial focus on one or two languages before broader multilingual rollout) would improve feasibility confidence and project management transparency.  This refinement is crucial before full-scale implementation to ensure tangible deliverables and robust evaluation outcomes within realistic resource and time constraints. [FEA-EXPERIMENT]"

          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty is marked as competitive, the proposal can significantly enhance its impact and distinctiveness by explicitly integrating concepts from the global list, especially health equity, social determinants of health, and conversational artificial intelligence in health care chatbots. For example, embedding the social determinants of health into the fairness and harm metrics could provide a more nuanced, context-aware ethical evaluation that reflects real-world disparities in digital health outcomes. Additionally, aligning the pipelineâ€™s ethical evaluation framework explicitly with civil rights laws and emerging US and international AI regulatory frameworks would strengthen policy relevance and applicability. Collaborating with stakeholders in health care quality improvement and traditional information retrieval systems to benchmark or augment the evaluation could widen the scope and applicability, resulting in a more robust and transformative multilingual ethical evaluation framework. This strategic integration will help differentiate the work and catalyze broader adoption and impact across health AI governance ecosystems. [SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION]"
