We call these models foundation models to\\nunderscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report\\nprovides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation\\nmodels, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics,\\nreasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model\\narchitectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation,\\ntheory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal\\nimpact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and\\nethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep\\nlearning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent\\ncapabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes\\nhomogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution,\\nas the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models\\ndownstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models,\\nwe currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and\\nwhat they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these\\nquestions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will\\nrequire deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their\\nfundamentally sociotechnical nature.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Challenges and Applications of Large Language Models', 'abstract': \"Large Language Models (LLMs) went from non-existent to ubiquitous in the\\nmachine learning discourse within a few years.

Adaptive systems were designed for different usage contexts, exploring different kinds of personalization. Web personalization has evolved into a large research field attracting scientists from different communities such as hypertext, user modeling, machine learning, natural language generation, information retrieval, intelligent tutoring systems, cognitive science, and Web-based education. This state-of-the-art survey provides a systematic overview of the ideas and techniques of the adaptive Web and serves as a central source of information for researchers, practitioners, and students. The volume constitutes a comprehensive and carefully planned collection of chapters, mapping out the most important areas of the adaptive Web, each solicited from experts and leaders in the field. The largest part of the book focuses on personalization techniques, namely the modeling side of personalization (Chaps. 1-5), and on adaptation, (Chaps. 6-14). The technique-focused part is complemented by four domain-oriented chapters in the third section of the book (Chaps. 15-18). The last section is devoted to recently emerging topics; it provides a prospective view of the new ideas and techniques that are moving rapidly into the focus of the adaptive Web community and gives the reader a glimpse into the not-so-distant future.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Encyclopedia of Parallel Computing', 'abstract': 'Containing over 300 entries in an A-Z format, the Encyclopedia of Parallel Computing provides easy, intuitive access to relevant information for professionals and researchers\\xa0seeking access to any aspect within the broad field of parallel computing.

Beyond folk psychology and its naïve theories of learning, psychological learning theories can be grouped into some basic categories, such as behaviorist learning theories, connectionist learning theories, cognitive learning theories, constructivist learning theories, and social learning theories. Learning theories are not limited to psychology and related fields of interest but rather we can find the topic of learning in various disciplines, such as philosophy and epistemology, education, information science, biology, and – as a result of the emergence of computer technologies – especially also in the field of computer sciences and artificial intelligence. As a consequence, machine learning struck a chord in the 1980s and became an important field of the learning sciences in general. As the learning sciences\\xa0became more specialized and complex, the various fields of interest were widely spread and separated from each other; as a consequence, even presently, there is no comprehensive overview of\\xa0the\\xa0sciences of learning or the central theoretical concepts and vocabulary on which researchers rely.\\xa0\\xa0 The Encyclopedia of the\\xa0Sciences of Learning\\xa0provides an up-to-date, broad and authoritative coverage of the specific terms mostly used in the sciences of learning and its related fields, including relevant areas of instruction,pedagogy, cognitive sciences, and especially machine learning and knowledge engineering.

How can our own lives emerge from interactions of electrons, protons, and neutrons? This book considers the interaction of physical and non-physical causation in complex systems such as living beings, and in particular in the human brain, relating this to the emergence of higher levels of complexity with real causal powers. In particular it explores the idea of top-down causation, which is the key effect allowing the emergence of true complexity and also enables the causal efficacy of non-physical entities, including the value of money, social conventions, and ethical choices.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'International Handbook of Research in History, Philosophy and Science Teaching', 'abstract': 'This inaugural handbook documents the distinctive research field that utilizes history and philosophy in investigation of theoretical, curricular and pedagogical issues in the teaching of science and mathematics.

The first handbook to cover the field, it lays down a much-needed marker of progress to date and provides a platform for informed and coherent future analysis and research of the subject. The publication comes at a time of heightened worldwide concern over the standard of science and mathematics education, attended by fierce debate over how best to reform curricula and enliven student engagement in the subjects There is a growing recognition among educators and policy makersthat the learning of science must dovetail with learning about science; this handbook is uniquely positioned as a locus for the discussion. The handbook features sections on pedagogical, theoretical, national, and biographical research, setting the literature of each tradition in its historical context. Each chapter engages in an assessment of the strengths and weakness of the research addressed, and suggests potentially fruitful avenues of future research. A key element of the handbook’s broader analytical framework is its identification and examination of unnoticed philosophical assumptions in science and mathematics research. It reminds readers at a crucial juncture that there has been a long and rich tradition of historical and philosophical engagements with science and mathematics teaching, and that lessons can be learnt from these engagements for the resolution of current theoretical, curricular and pedagogical questions that face teachers and administrators.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'The Human–Computer Interaction Handbook, Fundamentals, Evolving Technologies, and Emerging Applications', 'abstract': 'A paper widely read 20 years ago concluded with the advice to design a word processor by analogy to something familiar to everyone: a typewriter.

    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem addressed by this research cluster is understanding and improving the adaptability and effectiveness of foundation models—particularly large language models (LLMs)—across diverse downstream tasks in linguistically heterogeneous contexts. The core focus nodes (standard deep learning, transfer learning, downstream tasks, language models) and thematic islands indicate that the field centers on deploying deep learning architectures, especially foundation models, through transfer learning mechanisms to a variety of application areas. The central paradigms emphasize the sociotechnical nature of these models, acknowledging their widespread societal impact and emergent behaviors. The foundational literature highlights both the promise and the risks of foundation models, the rapid evolution and challenges of LLMs, and the need for multidisciplinary approaches involving machine learning research, natural language processing, user adaptation, and automation methodologies.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps within this cluster are evident in an incomplete understanding of how foundation models work, under what conditions they fail, and their resource inefficiencies when adapted to linguistically diverse and data-scarce scenarios. The absence of bridge nodes suggests a fragmentation between sociotechnical concerns and ML methodology, limiting integrated solutions. Furthermore, while transfer learning is a core method, its optimization for resource efficiency and linguistic diversity remains under-explored. Externally, from the global context analysis, there is a striking missed opportunity to integrate insights from health services systems and human-AI team dynamics into LLM adaptation. The concept of sociotechnical interactions in healthcare systems—such as clinical decision support and human-AI collaboration—provides a rich, empirically grounded framework for understanding and improving how LLMs might be adapted responsibly and efficiently. This overlooked 'hidden bridge' suggests that methodologies from healthcare informatics and organizational systems engineering could directly inform resource-efficient adaptation strategies for language models in real-world, high-diversity linguistic environments.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Leverage human-AI team research and decision support system frameworks from healthcare to design more interactive and co-adaptive LLM interfaces tailored to linguistically diverse populations, addressing the sociotechnical complexity and emergent failures identified as core limitations.\n\nOpportunity 2: Integrate systematic literature review methodologies and conceptual frameworks from health services systems engineering to create rigorous evaluation and benchmarking protocols for resource-efficient adaptation in low-resource and high-diversity linguistic contexts, thus addressing internal gaps in model understanding and failure modes.\n\nOpportunity 3: Apply organizational outcome metrics and work system factors from healthcare to the design of deployment workflows for LLMs in multilingual settings, improving the efficiency and fairness of adapted models across varied linguistic communities, thereby bridging the gap between technical transfer learning and sociotechnical impact assessment."
