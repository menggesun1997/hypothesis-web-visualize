    "title": "Multimodal Cognitive Bias Attribution in Multilingual LLMs Using Explainable Pragmatic Features",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current bias mitigation methods lack interpretability and do not adequately integrate multimodal (text plus visual/contextual) information, limiting detection of nuanced biases in multilingual environments.",
    "Motivation": "Combines internal gap on interpretability with thematic multimodal capabilities (from B1, B2) and cognitive pragmatics (Hidden Bridge in C) to generate an explainability-driven bias attribution framework. This fusion breaks new ground in bias understanding across language-modalities with explanatory pragmatics clues.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a bias attribution framework that inputs multilingual text and associated contextual modalities (images, metadata) into a joint model extracting pragmatic features linked to bias patterns. Employ explainable AI techniques to highlight multimodal cues contributing to biased outputs. Develop attribution maps relating linguistic pragmatics and visual biases. The system will support downstream bias mitigation by pinpointing semantic-pragmatic and multimodal bias sources.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble multimodal multilingual datasets with bias annotations.\n2) Build joint multimodal-pragmatic feature extractor.\n3) Integrate with explainability models (e.g., attention visualization).\n4) Compare bias attribution quality and interpretability vs unimodal baselines.\n5) Deploy mitigation experiments where attribution guides correction.\n6) Evaluate improvements in fairness and transparency.\n7) Conduct user studies with AI ethicists and practitioners.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: News article image + Spanish text mentioning ethnic groups.\nOutput: Attribution map highlights specific image elements and linguistic constructs contributing to ethnic bias, aiding targeted mitigation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If joint multimodal modeling proves unstable, separate unimodal pragmatic and visual bias detectors with a late fusion attribution mechanism. Alternatively, simulate case studies to inform model redesign."

        "title": "Explainable Multimodal Cognitive Bias Attribution in Multilingual LLMs Leveraging Pragmatic Features and Credibility Assessment",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current bias mitigation approaches in multilingual large language models (LLMs) predominantly focus on unimodal text data and often employ opaque heuristic or statistical methods, limiting interpretability and practical deployment. Integrating multimodal data (text, images, metadata) for nuanced bias detection introduces complex challenges in extracting and aligning pragmatic features across languages and cultural contexts with reliable explanation. Furthermore, existing explainability methods (e.g., attention maps) may produce noisy or misleading cues without rigorous validation. The absence of standardized, diverse multilingual multimodal datasets annotated for bias and pragmatic factors further impedes reproducible and robust evaluation. This undermines effective downstream bias mitigation and trust in model insights in complex real-world scenarios involving varied languages and modalities.",
        "Motivation": "We propose a novel, theoretically grounded multimodal bias attribution framework that bridges linguistic pragmatics and multimodal explainability with rigorous automatic credibility assessment techniques—a key advance beyond existing work. By grounding the design in pragmatics theory and empirical pilot studies, we address cross-linguistic and cultural alignment barriers. The approach incorporates state-of-the-art explainable AI methods curated for fidelity and robustness, extending beyond generic attention visualization. We also leverage recent advances in automatic credibility assessment, as an orthogonal signal to detect and attribute bias sources. This fusion not only enhances interpretability but also supports more precise bias mitigation guided by trustworthy, semantically and visually grounded attribution maps. Our framework explicitly tackles challenges identified in multilingual, multimodal environments, yielding superior bias detection and explanation capabilities with tangible impacts for fairness in AI systems serving global populations.",
        "Proposed_Method": "1) Develop a multilingual multimodal pragmatics extraction pipeline combining linguistic intelligence modules (syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic analyzers) pretrained and fine-tuned on diverse languages, with visual feature extractors sensitive to contextual cues relevant to bias (e.g., ethnic imagery, socio-cultural symbols).\n2) Integrate multimodal embeddings with automatic credibility assessment models trained on large-scale datasets of news credibility and persuasive techniques to provide complementary bias signals, enhancing attribution precision.\n3) Employ state-of-the-art explainability frameworks including SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), Integrated Gradients, and multimodal concept bottleneck models to produce robust and quantifiable attribution maps linking multimodal pragmatic features and credibility-driven bias cues.\n4) Incorporate domain adaptation strategies to mitigate modality dominance and disentangle entangled features, guided by quantitative metrics and pilot validation.\n5) Implement an end-to-end pipeline enabling downstream bias mitigation interventions informed directly by interpretable multimodal attribution outputs.\nThis method represents a fundamental advancement over current unimodal and naive explainability frameworks by uniting cross-disciplinary concepts of pragmatics, credibility assessment, and explainable AI in a rigorously validated multilingual multimodal context.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Assembly: Curate a diverse multilingual, multimodal dataset by combining existing resources (e.g., MultimodalQA, MMCoNa, and cross-lingual news corpora) enriched via crowdsourced annotations for bias, pragmatics, and credibility aspects. Develop annotation guidelines emphasizing cultural sensitivity and consistency, and conduct inter-annotator agreement analyses to ensure quality.\n2) Pilot Study: Conduct preliminary analyses on small dataset portions to validate pragmatic feature extraction and explainability method fidelity, refining model components and identifying confounders.\n3) Model Development: Build the joint multimodal-pragmatic-credibility model incorporating fusion and disentanglement mechanisms.\n4) Explainability Validation: Quantitatively assess interpretability using established metrics (e.g., fidelity, completeness, and user trust surveys with ethicists and linguists) and qualitatively via expert case studies.\n5) Benchmarking: Compare model performance against unimodal and baseline multimodal models on bias attribution accuracy, interpretability, and robustness across languages.\n6) Downstream Bias Mitigation: Implement mitigation strategies guided by attribution maps and measure impact on fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds, demographic parity).\n7) Human-Centered Evaluation: Conduct user studies with AI practitioners, ethicists, and sociolinguists to evaluate transparency, practical utility, and real-world deployment feasibility.\n8) Documentation and Release: Publish dataset, guidelines, and codebase to support reproducibility and community adoption.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A social media post combining an image depicting a cultural event and a Portuguese text mentioning minority groups with potential stereotypes.\nOutput: Multimodal attribution map highlighting specific linguistic pragmatic markers (e.g., implicatures, presuppositions) and salient visual elements contributing to biased portrayal, contextualized with credibility scores illustrating the information’s reliability. Accompanying explanations assist users in interpreting and addressing the identified bias effectively.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If joint multimodal-pragmatic-credibility modeling proves unstable or data scarcity limits training, fallback to modular unimodal pragmatic and visual bias detectors with interpretable late fusion based on credibility-informed weighting. Complement with simulated synthetic datasets generated using domain-specific knowledge and multilingual prompt engineering to support iterative refinement. Conduct additional pilot studies to guide iterative model and annotation protocol adjustments."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines relevant stages but lacks critical details regarding dataset sourcing, annotation quality, and model evaluation metrics. The assembly of multimodal multilingual datasets with reliable bias annotations is highly challenging and needs a concrete plan to ensure data diversity and annotation consistency, especially across languages and cultures. Further, the integration of explainability methods should specify which techniques will be used beyond generic attention visualization and how interpretability will be quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. Without more precision, feasibility in building a stable joint multimodal-pragmatic model and meaningful attribution maps remains an open question. Strengthening the experiment plan with concrete benchmarks, dataset sources or creation protocols, and robust evaluation criteria is essential for practical feasibility and scientific rigor in this complex space. This will also clarify efforts needed for downstream mitigation and user studies with ethicists/practitioners, ensuring the claimed interpretability and impact can be demonstrated effectively in the experiments and deployments proposed. Please enhance the experiment plan accordingly to improve feasibility and reproducibility assumptions. (Target section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)\"},{\"feedback_code\":\"SOU-ASSUMPTION\",\"feedback_content\":\"The central assumption that integrating multimodal pragmatic features with explainable AI techniques will lead to reliable and interpretable bias attribution in multilingual contexts needs stronger foundational support. The framework assumes that pragmatic features can be effectively extracted and meaningfully aligned across diverse modalities (text, images, metadata) and languages, which presents complex cross-linguistic and cultural challenges. Additionally, the assumption that explainability methods (e.g., attention visualization) can reveal precise visual and linguistic bias cues without significant noise or misinterpretation requires validation or preliminary evidence. The proposal would benefit from a clearer articulation of the theoretical grounding or pilot analyses supporting these core assumptions, as well as identification of potential confounders such as modality dominance or feature entanglement that might undermine interpretability. Strengthening this theoretical base will improve the soundness and credibility of the proposed method and guide realistic expectations on performance and impact.
