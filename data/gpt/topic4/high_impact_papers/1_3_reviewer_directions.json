    "title": "Cross-Domain Cognitive-Social Knowledge Graph for LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of integrated knowledge representations linking computational algorithmic advances, social psychology theories, and linguistic typology hampers comprehensive LLM training that addresses diversity and bias.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the internal siloing gap by constructing a cross-domain heterogeneous knowledge graph unifying linguistic typology metadata, document image processing features, and cognitive social psychology constructs such as attention and stereotypes to inform LLM contextualization inherently.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a Knowledge Graph (KG) incorporating nodes from linguistic typologies (morphosyntactic features, language family), document image processing metadata (visual text layout), and cognitive social psychology constructs (e.g., elaboration likelihood paths, stereotype dimensions). Integrate the KG embeddings into LLM input layers, allowing the model to query contextual prior knowledge dynamically during training and inference to adaptively attend to language diversity, typological nuances, and sociocognitive expectations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Extract and merge data from linguistic databases (WALS), image document datasets, and social psychology corpora. 2) Construct and embed KG using graph neural networks. 3) Fuse KG embeddings into LLM token embeddings. 4) Train and evaluate on multilingual, typologically diverse benchmarks with bias and sociocultural sensitivity metrics. 5) Conduct ablation on KG components' impact.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Text with homographs influenced by typological differences combined with social context cues affecting interpretation. Expected Output: Correct sense disambiguation reflected by KG-informed knowledge, sensitive to stereotypes and typological patterns.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If KG embedding fusion proves ineffective, explore external memory-augmented architectures querying KG at runtime or adopt retrieval-augmented strategies with KG as a source."
