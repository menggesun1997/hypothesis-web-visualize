In addition to expected entries covering the basics of traditional theories and methods, other entries discuss important sociopolitical issues and trends influencing the future of that research and practice. Textbooks, handbooks, monographs and other publications focus on various aspects of educational research, measurement and evaluation, but to date, there exists no major reference guide for students new to the field. This comprehensive work fills that gap, covering traditional areas while pointing the way to future developments. Features: Nearly 700 signed entries are contained in an authoritative work spanning four volumes and available in choice of electronic and/or print formats. Although organized A-to-Z, front matter includes a Reader’s Guide grouping entries thematically to help students interested in a specific aspect of education research, measurement, and evaluation to more easily locate directly related entries. (For instance, sample themes include Data, Evaluation, Measurement Concepts & Issues, Research, Sociopolitical Issues, Standards.) Back matter includes a Chronology of the development of the field; a Resource Guide to classic books, journals, and associations; and a detailed Index. Entries conclude with References/Further Readings and Cross References to related entries.

The fabric of the EU linguistic landscape comprises 24 official languages and over 60 regional and minority languages. However, language barriers still hamper communication and the free flow of information. Multilingualism is a key cultural cornerstone of Europe, signifying what it means to be and to feel European. Various studies and resolutions have found a striking imbalance in the support of Europe’s languages through technologies, issuing a call to action. Following an introduction, the book is divided into two parts. The first part describes the state of the art of language technology and language-centric AI and the definition and metrics developed to measure digital language equality. It also presents the status quo in 2022/2023, i.e., the current level of technology support for over 30 European languages. The second part describes plans and recommendations on how to bring about digital language equality in Europe by 2030. It includes chapters on the setup and results of the community consultation process, four technical deep dives, an overview of existing strategic documents and an abridged version of the strategic agenda and roadmap. The recommendations have been prepared jointly with the European community in the fields of language technology, natural language processing, and language-centric AI, as well as with representatives of relevant initiatives and associations, language communities and regional and minority language groups. Ensuring appropriate technology support for all European languages will not only create jobs, growth and opportunities in the digital single market. Overcoming language barriers in the digital environment is also essential for an inclusive society and for providing unity in diversity for many years to come.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'The Palgrave Handbook of Digital Russia Studies', 'abstract': 'This open access handbook presents a multidisciplinary and multifaceted perspective on how the ‘digital’ is simultaneously changing Russia and the research methods scholars use to study Russia.

    "title": "Research Landscape Map for Incorporating Linguistic Typology into LLM Training to Enhance Diversity Representation",
    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem addressed by this research cluster revolves around effectively processing and analyzing language data—especially diverse and pluralistic linguistic inputs—to improve representation and understanding within language-centric AI systems such as large language models (LLMs). The core focus, as indicated by central nodes like 'document image processing', 'image processing', 'analysis of algorithms', and the inclusion of 'political science' and 'international relations' suggests a dominant intersection between computational linguistic techniques, their algorithmic underpinnings, and their applications within social sciences contexts. The two principal thematic islands cluster technical methodologies around image/document processing and algorithmic analysis, and separately, qualitative and theoretical research in political and social sciences. The presence of such distinct but thematically connected clusters indicates that the dominant research paradigms in this landscape are based on advanced computational approaches (especially related to processing complex, multimodal texts) combined with qualitative and theoretical frameworks to understand social and political implications of language data. The core methods involve comparative algorithmic analysis, qualitative empirical research, and mixed methods approaches to measurement and evaluation, reflecting a multidisciplinary orientation bridging technical and social scientific perspectives.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Notably, there are no bridge nodes connecting the computational thematic island with the social sciences/theoretical island, indicating a siloing effect and lack of integrative frameworks that could unify algorithmic advances with sociopolitical and linguistic typological theory. The selected foundational papers mostly address broad methodologies or unrelated domains (e.g., educational measurement, interpersonal violence, political science methods) rather than specifics of linguistic typology or LLM training, suggesting a gap in targeted, domain-specific research on typology-informed LLM enhancement. Additionally, the local concepts emphasize 'document image processing' but do not directly tackle linguistic diversity or typological variation, pointing to a limitation in addressing linguistic diversity through current algorithmic methodologies. External/Novel Gaps: The global context analysis (Part C) identifies a hidden bridge between 'image processing' and 'SAGE Handbook', linking to cognitive and social psychological constructs such as elaboration likelihood model, automatic attention, stereotype content model, and rhetorical devices. This suggests an unexplored opportunity to incorporate cognitive psychology theories about attention, persuasion, and stereotype processing into the design of algorithmic approaches for linguistic diversity. These constructs can inform LLMs to better capture nuanced linguistic variations, typological structures, and sociocultural contexts. Such cross-disciplinary integration between computational image processing techniques and cognitive/social psychology theory remains unexploited by the local research cluster and could address both the technical and sociopolitical dimensions of diverse language representation in AI models.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate cognitive social psychology theories—such as the elaboration likelihood model and stereotype content model—revealed in the hidden bridge analysis with existing algorithmic frameworks in 'document image processing' and 'analysis of algorithms' to develop LLM training paradigms that better attend to and represent linguistic stereotypes and diversity in typologically varied languages. This can address internal gaps of sociolinguistic sensitivity and bias in computational models.\n\nOpportunity 2: Develop a multidisciplinary framework that bridges the computational methods cluster (focused on image and document processing algorithms) with qualitative empirical analysis and theoretical argumentation from the political science and social science paradigms. This joint framework would foster integrative approaches to incorporate linguistic typology into LLM training with enhanced sociopolitical awareness, closing the silo gap identified by the absence of bridge nodes.\n\nOpportunity 3: Extend current LLM training datasets and methodologies by leveraging the strategic insights from the European Language Equality agenda (not directly included in the foundational papers but highly relevant) and connect these with cognitive mechanisms of language processing to build typology-informed, culturally sensitive LLMs. This leverages both documented regional language diversity needs and cognitive processing theories to create richer, more equitable language AI systems."
