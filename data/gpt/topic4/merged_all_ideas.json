        "title": "Contrastive Cross-Modal Graph Transformer Integration for Grounded Language Modeling in Underrepresented Languages",
        "Problem_Statement": "Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) struggle to effectively incorporate structured, heterogeneous, and multilingual knowledge graph data, especially for underrepresented languages that lack rich textual corpora. This results in limited factual grounding, cultural contextualization, and suboptimal downstream task performance due to shallow semantic representations.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work has explored hybrid models combining language and graph embeddings, existing approaches often lack rigorous architectural design for dynamic, multilingual subgraph encoding and alignment during inference; they also tend to insufficiently address hallucination and grounding robustness. Given the highly competitive landscape and advances in graph transformers and contrastive cross-modal learning, this proposal seeks to advance novelty and impact by architecting a tightly integrated cross-modal framework. It leverages pre-trained multilingual models fused with graph transformer networks enhanced by contrastive learning objectives that explicitly align textual and graph embeddings into a shared latent space. Additionally, incorporating user-centric contextualization inspired by recommender systems offers a novel direction for adaptable, relevant knowledge grounding in low-resource scenarios. This strategy aims to fundamentally improve the factual and cultural knowledge integration for underrepresented languages, boosting interpretability, generalization, and downstream task accuracy.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel hybrid framework that tightly integrates a pretrained multilingual transformer (e.g., mBERT) with a graph transformer network tailored for cross-modal encoding of heterogeneous, multilingual knowledge graphs. The graph transformer encodes dynamically retrieved subgraphs related to input text, leveraging node and edge type embeddings and relation-aware attention to represent rich factual and cultural knowledge. Both textual token embeddings and graph embeddings are projected into a unified latent space, with cross-attention layers facilitating fine-grained conditioning of token representations on relevant graph context. Training uses a multi-task objective combining downstream tasks (e.g., fact verification, entity linking) and a contrastive learning loss that explicitly maximizes alignment between paired text and graph embeddings, enhancing generalization across languages and entity types. To guard against hallucination and factual inconsistency, we embed a knowledge consistency regularizer that penalizes divergence between retrieved graph facts and generated token representations. We further incorporate a user-context embedding module inspired by recommender systems, injecting domain-specific or user-interest signals to enhance relevance and grounding, particularly in specialized or culturally nuanced contexts. Architecturally, we employ modular graph transformer blocks optimized for scalability via sparse attention and mini-batch subgraph sampling, enabling efficient inference despite heterogeneous graph structures. This end-to-end trainable, rigorously specified mechanism advances beyond loosely coupled fusion by deeply grounding representations, leveraging recent advances in graph neural networks, pre-trained multilingual transformers, and contrastive multimodal objectives to achieve robust, interpretable knowledge-enhanced LLMs for underrepresented languages.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct and align multilingual knowledge graphs focused on underrepresented languages, ensuring rich semantic, entity, and relation diversity.\n2) Design and implement a graph transformer network with relation-aware attention mechanisms tailored to heterogeneous graph data.\n3) Integrate the graph transformer with a pretrained multilingual transformer using cross-attention layers; implement unified embedding projection layers.\n4) Develop the user-context embedding module incorporating domain and user interest signals.\n5) Formulate multi-task training with downstream objectives (entity linking, fact verification, NER) combined with contrastive learning losses for text-graph embedding alignment and a knowledge consistency regularizer.\n6) Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of contrastive loss, knowledge regularization, and user context.\n7) Benchmark performance against strong transformer-only and prior hybrid baselines using metrics like F1, accuracy, and knowledge consistency scores.\n8) Analyze hallucination rates and factual consistency qualitatively and quantitatively.\n9) Optimize scalability and efficiency through sparse attention and subgraph sampling; evaluate inference overhead.\n10) Explore adaptability across several underrepresented languages to validate generalization and cultural grounding gains.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A Haitian Creole news snippet mentioning a local leader and a cultural festival.\nExpected Output: Accurate entity linking identifying the leader with contextual information from the knowledge graph, culturally grounded summarization referencing the festival’s significance, and factually consistent answers to queries about the event. User-context embedding tailored to a regional audience should enrich relevance and specificity.\n\nInput: A Yoruba-language health advisory containing domain-specific terminology.\nExpected Output: Correct fact verification leveraging medical subgraphs, named entity recognition tailored to low-resource medical vocabulary, and cross-language generalization from related multilingual knowledge graphs, producing accurate, culturally sensitive content generation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If end-to-end joint training reveals instability or excessive resource demands, we will adopt a progressive staged training pipeline: first pretrain the graph transformer and user-context modules separately with contrastive objectives; then fine-tune the integrated model on downstream tasks. Alternatively, we will precompute graph embeddings and cache these for lightweight fusion via adapters or gating mechanisms at transformer layers. We will also explore techniques such as knowledge distillation and parameter sharing to alleviate complexity. Additionally, dynamic subgraph pruning and sparse attention will be tuned to maintain feasible inference efficiency while preserving grounding quality."

        "Problem_Statement": "Current multilingual large language models (LLMs) struggle with degraded performance and cultural insensitivity when applied to low-resource and underrepresented languages, mainly due to limited culturally rich training data, centralized data collection challenges, and opaque adaptation mechanisms. This impedes real-world applicability, ethical inclusivity, and community trust for marginalized language communities.",
        "Motivation": "While existing methods attempt multilingual adaptation, few achieve effective cultural contextualization combined with scalability, privacy, and transparency. This proposal aims to overcome these gaps by innovatively integrating federated learning for privacy-preserving, decentralized data collection and fine-tuning with culture-aware adapter modules enhanced by explicit interpretability techniques inspired by Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). This novel fusion addresses the critical scalability and ethical transparency limitations in current work, advancing multilingual transformer adaptation beyond typical centralized, opaque frameworks. By enabling community-driven participation without raw data centralization and providing actionable explanations for model decisions, this approach uniquely positions itself in the highly competitive multilingual NLP field as a culturally sensitive, community-trusted, and ethically aligned methodology with potential for significant impact on neglected low-resource languages.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a phased, modular transformer architecture incorporating culture-aware adapter layers dynamically conditioned on culturally encoded embeddings derived from multi-modal cultural knowledge graphs. To address data scarcity and privacy, we integrate a federated learning framework enabling decentralized, privacy-preserving fine-tuning with direct participation of diverse low-resource language communities. Simultaneously, we embed an explainability module inspired by LIME that produces local, interpretable explanations for the adapter layers' decisions, enhancing transparency, bias detection, and community trust. Our method entails a two-level representation learning pipeline combining linguistic and cultural semantics, contrastive learning over culturally contextual pairs for semantic alignment, and systematic iterative validation via pilot studies. We employ advanced community engagement protocols with both automated and expert-guided knowledge graph construction methods to ensure reproducibility and bias mitigation. This integrative approach innovatively combines state-of-the-art privacy-preserving ML and interpretable AI paradigms with multilingual transformer adapters, defining a novel research trajectory surpassing existing transformer adaptation baselines like mT5 and XLM-R in cultural sensitivity, ethical inclusivity, and operational feasibility.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Pilot Phase: Select a single low-resource language (e.g., Wolof) to establish a scalable and reproducible pipeline. Collect multilingual corpora enriched with community-sourced cultural metadata using federated data collection protocols that maintain user privacy. 2) Develop semi-automated workflows combining community expert inputs and NLP tools to construct cultural knowledge graphs, with defined quality control and bias audit procedures documented for reproducibility. 3) Implement federated learning fine-tuning of culture-aware adapter layers on decentralized cultural datasets via secure aggregation. 4) Integrate LIME-inspired explainability modules providing interpretable insights into adapter decisions during inference. 5) Conduct iterative evaluation cycles measuring performance on standard multilingual benchmarks adapted for cultural relevance, and assess interpretability and fairness metrics with community involvement. 6) Conduct comparative analyses with baseline multilingual transformers (e.g., mT5, XLM-R) in centralized vs. federated settings. 7) Scale to a second language (e.g., Quechua) guided by pilot learnings, refining community engagement and methodological protocols. Throughout, maintain rigorous documentation, and fallback contingency includes reverting to knowledge distillation augmented with federated cultural snippet retrieval if early adapter benefits are limited.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A community story request in Wolof containing culturally significant concepts such as indigenous idioms and social norms.\nExpected Output: A summary preserving the cultural references accurately, avoiding literal mistranslation or insensitive interpretation, with an accompanying transparent explanation (produced by the LIME-inspired module) detailing which cultural embeddings influenced the adapter's summarization choices, thus enabling community stakeholders to verify and trust the output.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated fine-tuning proves inefficient or unstable, fallback to a hybrid method combining centralized knowledge distillation from large pre-trained models with client-side cultural snippet retrieval for on-the-fly adapter conditioning. If cultural knowledge graph construction faces reproducibility challenges, bolster automated graph induction techniques with crowdsourced validation and embed continuous bias auditing cycles. For explainability module limitations, employ alternate interpretable models such as SHAP or attention-based probing techniques to maintain transparency objectives. These fallback strategies ensure operational continuity and allow iterative refinement aligned with project goals within realistic resource and timeline constraints."

        "title": "Multimodal Sociolinguistic Embeddings for Robust, Bias-Aware Multilingual Language Modeling Grounded in Computational Social Science",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current bias evaluations on multilingual large language models (LLMs) inadequately capture subtle sociolinguistic nuances influencing language representations in underrepresented communities because they often rely solely on textual data. Incorporating multimodal social contextual signals—such as social graphs, demographic, and socioeconomic indicators—holds promise but rests on critical assumptions about data accessibility, quality, and ethical use, especially for marginalized populations where data may be sparse, sensitive, or incomplete. Furthermore, the complexity of social dynamics and potential noise or bias introduced by these data sources challenge straightforward integration with language representations. Without rigorous foundational justification and methodological strategies addressing these issues, there is a risk of generating embeddings that inadvertently encode stereotypes or fail to generalize reliably. Therefore, a principled approach explicitly examining these assumptions, grounded in computational social science methodologies and ethical data practices, is essential to produce trustworthy, context-aware bias evaluations that can meaningfully benefit underrepresented languages and communities.",
        "Motivation": "This research addresses the competitive and nuanced landscape of bias evaluation in multilingual LLMs by innovatively integrating computational social science principles into the design of multimodal sociolinguistic embeddings. By embedding social network structures, socio-demographic stratifications, and textual data through graph neural networks (GNNs) harmonized with transformer-based language models, we aim to transcend limitations of prior text-only approaches. The project leverages causal inference frameworks to disentangle sociolinguistic bias from confounding social factors and incorporates concepts such as interlanguage and idealized native speaker norms to refine sociolinguistic representation. This integration deepens the understanding of sociolinguistic phenomena in AI, enriches bias quantification with contextually grounded metrics, and explicitly addresses ethical considerations around privacy and data sparsity. This creates a rigorous foundation that advances AI fairness, responsible multilingual NLP, and sociolinguistic research, delivering improved fidelity and generalizability for marginalized language communities within a respectful and ethically robust framework.",

        "Problem_Statement": "Indigenous languages face a scarcity of large textual datasets for effective language model pretraining, yet rich complementary modalities such as speech recordings, illustrative images, and sparse text exist within cultural heritage archives. Existing federated pretraining approaches do not adequately address the challenges of multimodal data heterogeneity, uneven modality availability across decentralized clients, and stringent privacy requirements intrinsic to sensitive indigenous cultural data.",
        "Motivation": "Building upon foundational research in federated learning and multimodal language representation, this work pioneers a federated multimodal pretraining framework that innovatively integrates modality-specific encoders with a shared fusion layer, explicitly designed to robustly handle asynchronous and uneven modality presence across clients. Beyond simply combining speech, images, and text, the method rigorously incorporates advanced privacy-preserving mechanisms suitable for sensitive indigenous cultural archives. This approach advances natural language understanding and generation capabilities in under-resourced languages by enabling privacy-aware, scalable pretraining that respects both data locality and cultural norms. The proposed method represents a significant novelty leap by detailing the interplay of federated aggregation, modality fusion, privacy guarantees, and bias mitigation strategies to ensure equitable learning across modalities and client heterogeneity.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a federated multimodal pretraining architecture comprising the following components: (1) Modality-specific transformer encoders for text, audio, and image inputs deployed locally at each client. (2) A shared, centralized multimodal fusion layer that aggregates modality embeddings into unified semantic representations, trained through secure federated aggregation protocols. To handle uneven modality availability, we design a dynamic modality gating mechanism that selectively activates fusion pathways based on local client data presence, mitigating biases toward dominant modalities. Communication is optimized by transmitting only modality embeddings and fusion gradients rather than full model weights, reducing bandwidth costs. Privacy is rigorously preserved through a combination of secure multiparty computation-based secure aggregation, differentially private noise injection calibrated to a formal privacy budget, and client-level contribution clipping to prevent information leakage. Federated optimization uses adaptive weighted averaging to balance model updates from heterogeneous clients and modalities, while fairness constraints discourage bias toward well-represented modalities or clients. The pretrained multimodal foundation model can then be fine-tuned for downstream NLP tasks relevant to indigenous language communities, such as machine translation, entity recognition, and question answering, enabling enhanced digital library and natural language generation applications. This method advances the security domain of federated learning by integrating privacy-preserving technology tailored for culturally sensitive settings, benefiting security practitioners and language preservation experts alike.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Acquisition & Ethics: Partner with indigenous communities and digital libraries to access multimodal datasets; establish formal legal and ethical clearances emphasizing cultural sensitivity and data sovereignty; and develop community engagement protocols ensuring ongoing collaboration and consent. 2) Dataset Preparation: Curate federated datasets involving multiple clients across languages (e.g., Quechua, Mapudungun), modalities (speech, images, text), and document rigorous metadata descriptions for modality presence and data quality. 3) Baseline Implementation: Implement unimodal and naive federated multimodal pretraining baselines without privacy mechanisms to establish performance references. 4) Proposed Method Development: Develop modality-specific encoders and fusion layers with secure aggregation and differential privacy mechanisms integrated, implementing modality gating and adaptive client weighting. 5) Federated Training & Scaling: Conduct controlled federated training experiments simulating client heterogeneity, modality imbalance, and network constraints; perform ablation studies quantifying impacts of privacy budgets, modality gating thresholds, and fusion strategies. 6) Evaluation: Evaluate linguistic performance using diverse benchmarks (translation accuracy, entity recognition F1 scores, question answering metrics), measure privacy leakage risks via formal privacy budget accounting, and analyze fairness in model performance across clients and modalities. 7) Risk Assessment & Mitigation: Monitor communication overhead, convergence stability, and potential modality bias; incorporate contingency measures like curriculum learning, modality-specific augmentation, and resource-efficient model compression. 8) Community Feedback: Conduct surveys and workshops with partnered communities and security practitioners to assess cultural alignment, ethical considerations, and usability of pretrained models. 9) Dissemination: Release code, privacy-preserving protocols, and documented datasets while adhering to community data governance agreements to facilitate future research and applications.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input Example: A local client node representing a Quechua-speaking community provides audio-recorded oral stories, scanned cultural illustrations associated with the narratives, and sparse textual transcripts. The system dynamically activates the audio and image encoders while gating out any unused modalities. During federated training, the modality embedding gradients are securely aggregated with those from other client nodes receiving different modality combinations (e.g., only images with minimal text), preserving differential privacy guarantees. Output Example: A robust, federated-pretrained multimodal language model that significantly outperforms unimodal baselines on Quechua machine translation and question answering tasks while ensuring no raw data leaves client devices. The model maintains balanced performance across modalities and clients without favoring dominant data sources, enabling secure deployment in indigenous digital libraries and natural language generation pipelines.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If modality imbalance or client heterogeneity leads to convergence instability or modality domination, we will implement curriculum learning strategies prioritizing underrepresented modalities and gradually introducing others to balance learning. Additionally, we will explore semi-supervised domain adaptation leveraging publicly available indigenous language textual corpora to improve representation robustness. To mitigate privacy-utility trade-offs, we will calibrate differential privacy parameters and selectively apply noise addition at fusion layers while investigating model compression techniques to reduce communication and computation overhead. In case of limited dataset availability, we will pivot to synthetic data augmentation guided by security domain best practices and consult with community stakeholders to expand data collection ethically. Throughout, iterative community feedback loops will guide adjustments to ensure the approach remains practical, respectful, and impactful."

        "Problem_Statement": "Federated training aggregating gradient updates uniformly across typologically diverse languages often causes negative interference and performance degradation, impeding robust multilingual model generalization and transfer especially in low-resource and underrepresented languages.",
        "Motivation": "Current federated multilingual optimization approaches overlook the dynamic, agent-level characteristics of client languages and their operational contexts, leading to suboptimal gradient aggregation that mainly relies on static linguistic typology. By reconceptualizing each client language node as an agent with distinct objectives, resource constraints, and evolving data distributions, we can leverage multi-agent coordination principles to dynamically balance gradient contributions. This fusion of linguistic theory, multi-agent systems, and information system security offers a novel, adaptive framework addressing gradient conflicts and bias toward dominant languages. Our approach advances federated multilingual NLP by integrating context-aware, distributed optimization that responds to heterogeneous language characteristics and security needs, marking a substantive step beyond prior static weighting methods.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an Agent-Guided Federated Gradient Balancing (AG-FGB) framework where each client language is modeled as a learning agent with its own local objective, performance feedback, and resource profile. The core gradient weighting function is formalized as \\( w_i = \\sigma(f_{typ}(T_i), f_{stat}(S_i), f_{perf}(P_i), f_{ctx}(C_i)) \\), where:  - \\(T_i\\): typological embedding vectors encoding syntactic order, morphology, etc.  - \\(S_i\\): statistical similarity measures (e.g., lexical overlap).  - \\(P_i\\): online performance metrics (e.g., local BLEU, loss convergence).  - \\(C_i\\): contextual factors like client resource constraints and network conditions. The function \\(f\\) is implemented as a trainable neural network jointly optimized across rounds with the global model. This enables adaptive weighting that balances typological knowledge with dynamic agent feedback, mitigating bias toward dominant clients. Additionally, agent negotiation protocols inspired by multi-agent reinforcement learning enable clients to propose and adjust their gradient weights iteratively before aggregation, fostering consensus and conflict reduction. Privacy-preserving mechanisms including differential privacy and secure aggregation protocols drawn from modern information systems are integrated to safeguard sensitive data during weight updates and negotiation. We provide algorithmic pseudocode detailing the joint training of weighting functions, agent feedback integration, and secure coordination steps. The weighting adapts online to new languages and dialects, guided by minimal labeled data and unsupervised domain adaptation techniques, ensuring robustness and generalizability in dynamic federated environments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct typological embeddings from linguistic databases and extract statistical similarity metrics for participating languages. 2) Define client agents modeling resource profiles and local objectives; implement performance and contextual feedback mechanisms. 3) Develop and implement the weighting function \\(w_i\\) as a differentiable neural model integrated with the federated optimizer. 4) Incorporate multi-agent reinforcement learning inspired negotiation protocols for dynamic gradient weight adjustment before aggregation. 5) Integrate privacy-preserving protocols including secure aggregation and differential privacy; validate system security under simulated attacks. 6) Conduct federated training simulations over multilingual datasets with both dominant and underrepresented languages (e.g., Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, plus emerging dialects). 7) Measure language-wise metrics (BLEU, perplexity), gradient conflict reduction, convergence stability, and bias mitigation relative to uniform and static typology-based baseline methods. 8) Perform extensive ablations to assess individual contributions of typological, statistical, performance, and contextual components. 9) Test framework robustness to dynamic client membership and labeled data scarcity via incremental experiments.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "In federated translation training of Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo, each language node acts as an agent with local objectives and resources. AG-FGB dynamically adjusts gradient weights by combining typological embeddings with real-time performance feedback and resource context. For example, the system down-weights noisy or resource-constrained clients adaptively, preventing dominant language bias. The output is an aggregate multilingual model demonstrating balanced performance improvements — higher BLEU scores for underrepresented languages without sacrificing dominant language quality — and smoother convergence relative to static weighting or uniform aggregation. During the addition of a new dialect with limited labels, the weighting function quickly adapts via unsupervised domain signals, enabling seamless integration without degrading overall model performance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should training instability arise from complex agent coordination, we will simplify by restricting weighting adaptation to a subset of features (e.g., fixing typology embeddings) and employing heuristic consensus protocols. If privacy integration limits performance, we will explore alternative secure aggregation methods balancing privacy and efficiency. In case negotiating weights prove too costly, clustering clients based on learned embeddings with meta-learning for weighting adjustments will be explored, alongside gradient surgery to explicitly remove conflicting gradient components to mitigate negative transfer."

The fundamental assumption that typological divergences—captured via features such as word order, morphological complexity, and phonological inventories—systematically influence transfer learning remains under-explored and insufficiently justified in literature. Moreover, it is unclear which typological dimensions most strongly affect neural representation learning or whether certain features contribute noise. Addressing this gap requires a rigorous theoretical and empirical grounding to validate typological distance as a reliable basis for curriculum learning and to ensure that such curricula outperform or complement family-based clustering and random curricula in multilingual transformers.",
        "Motivation": "This work aims to advance the field beyond English-centric and language-family-based approaches by explicitly validating and leveraging typological features that contribute meaningfully to cross-lingual transfer. By systematically analyzing the predictive power of individual and combined typological features on model transfer gains, our approach justifies and refines curriculum design theoretically and empirically. Our method uniquely integrates these insights into a dynamic curriculum learning framework that mirrors second language acquisition theories—progressing from typologically close languages to more distant ones—to enhance model generalization, representation robustness, and fairness, including mitigating bias toward typologically unique languages. This addresses internal gaps in typology integration, grounding our approach in linguistic typology, cognitive learning principles, and recent advances in fairness evaluation for NLP.",

We will quantify the correlation and predictive power of typological distances computed separately for syntactic (e.g., word order), morphological, and phonological features against observed zero-shot and few-shot transfer learning gains in pretrained multilingual transformers. This phase establishes the valid features and distance functions to inform curriculum design. (2) Typology-Guided Curriculum Learning: Utilizing the validated typological distance metric, we design a dynamic curriculum that gradually advances from languages most typologically similar to English (or a specified pivot) toward more distant languages. Training sequences follow incremental typological distance thresholds with tunable step granularity, inspired by second language acquisition paradigms emphasizing scaffolded exposure for cognitive and socio-emotional learning efficacy. (3) Fairness and Bias-Aware Evaluation: To address biases towards typologically unique languages, we include auxiliary tasks in the curriculum that explicitly predict typological attributes from representations and enforce contrastive losses to emphasize typological distinctions. This is augmented by metrics specifically designed to measure performance on typologically rare linguistic constructs (e.g., ergativity, click consonants), quantifying fairness and representation diversity. Integration of socio-emotional processing theories informs curriculum pacing to optimize model adaptability.",

Expected Output: Compared to baseline curricula, models trained with the typology-guided curriculum achieve statistically significant gains in zero-shot and few-shot transfer on typologically distant languages, demonstrated by higher accuracy on POS tagging and NER tasks. Performance disparities between typologically unique and mainstream languages reduce, indicating improved fairness and bias mitigation. Auxiliary typology prediction tasks show improved typology-informed representation learning, and ablations confirm the necessity of curriculum pacing. Phenomena such as improved handling of rare morphological and phonological constructs evidence enhanced representation diversity and generalization.",

Additionally, we will explore adaptive curriculum pacing inspired by cognitive and socio-emotional processing from second language acquisition literature to enhance learning dynamics. If computational constraints limit scaling, smaller subsets of languages and task-specific fine-tuning will be conducted to isolate model improvements attributable to typology.

        "Problem_Statement": "Current multilingual large language models (LLMs) often organize language embeddings predominantly by language family or script rather than by deeper typological features. This limits their ability to generalize across typologically similar but genetically distant languages and hinders bias mitigation in underrepresented languages. Additionally, existing approaches lack clear, stable mechanisms to balance typology-based constraints against task-specific demands during model fine-tuning.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work emphasizes family- or script-based clustering, typological features (morphosyntactic, phonological, etc.) offer richer structural signals that can improve multilingual LLM generalization and equitable performance. Our approach is novel in explicitly regularizing embedding spaces with typological distances grounded in linguistic databases, carefully balancing these constraints with downstream task requirements through a well-defined integrated loss function. Beyond theoretical gains, incorporating human-centered AI perspectives, we connect embedding improvements to real-world benefits for underrepresented language communities—particularly those with divergent typological features, such as Indic languages and varieties of World Englishes. This positions our work to drive socially impactful, human-computer interaction improvements in multilingual NLP applications.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel, mathematically explicit embedding regularization framework that integrates typological constraints directly into the fine-tuning objective of multilingual LLMs. Specifically, given a batch of language embeddings \\(E = \\{e_1, e_2, ..., e_n\\}\\), and a typological distance matrix \\(T\\) derived from databases like WALS, we define the total loss as:\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_{total} = \\mathcal{L}_{task} + \\lambda \\cdot \\mathcal{L}_{typology},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\n\\mathcal{L}_{typology} = \\sum_{i,j} \\left( \\|e_i - e_j\\|_2 - f(T_{ij}) \\right)^2\n\\) enforces the learned embedding distances to approximate a monotonic mapping \\(f(\\cdot)\\) of typological distances \\(T_{ij}\\). This encourages embeddings of typologically similar languages to cluster while respecting task-driven relational nuances.\n\nTo balance conflicting gradients between the task loss and typology regularization — especially where typological similarity does not align with task semantics — we:\n\n1. Employ a learnable, monotonic scaling function \\(f\\) parameterized via a neural network to flexibly map typological distances to embedding space constraints.\n2. Utilize gradient projection techniques at each optimization step to resolve conflicts, ensuring stable convergence.\n3. Schedule \\(\\lambda\\) dynamically, starting with a low value and increasing as fine-tuning progresses to prevent early training destabilization.\n\nTo ground this in human-centered AI, we incorporate user-centered case studies targeting underrepresented linguistic communities, measuring both automatic metrics and qualitative usability improvements resulting from typology-aware embeddings.",

Downstream tasks — e.g., multilingual question answering and sentiment analysis — demonstrate improved cross-lingual transfer and bias mitigation, particularly for typologically atypical and underrepresented languages. Human user studies report enhanced usability and reduced misinterpretations tied to typology-aware model outputs.",

This discrepancy impedes equitable access to quality clinical NLP tools globally. Prior approaches insufficiently justify how embedding typological information operationally captures complex linguistic nuances in clinical contexts rich with domain-specific jargon. An explicit, theory-driven framework is needed to integrate linguistic typology with clinical language modeling to systematically adapt NLP models without overwhelming them or introducing noise, particularly under severe data scarcity.",

It addresses the urgent socio-technical imperative of language equality in healthcare by providing principled, interpretable model adaptation techniques. This approach uniquely situates linguistic theory at the core of domain-specific NLP model enhancement, a novel contribution relative to existing competitive multilingual healthcare NLP efforts.",

By integrating detailed typological priors with dynamic sociolinguistic descriptors representing language varieties, our approach addresses a critical gap: enabling efficient, fine-grained, few-shot adaptation not only across typologically diverse languages but also across dialectal and sociolectal variations. This interdisciplinary fusion of linguistic typology, sociolinguistics, and meta-learning enhances adaptability and fairness in multilingual NLP, going beyond standard fine-tuning and prior work limited by static language representations. This originality and practical impact elevate the approach in a competitive research space.",

Typological embeddings will be constructed from well-established typological databases (e.g., WALS) using a structured schema representing phonological, morphological, syntactic traits. To capture sociolinguistic variation, we incorporate features capturing dialectal variation, phonological and morphosyntactic variation within language varieties, derived from linguistic survey data (e.g., from fieldwork corpora of low-resource Indic languages), and incorporate metadata such as geographic, social, and register indices where available. These composite embeddings guide a model-agnostic meta-learning approach (e.g., an improved MAML variant with stability enhancements like first-order approximations and gradient clipping) that learns how typological and sociolinguistic factors affect model adaptation. We explicitly design intermediate validation steps: (1) ablation studies on embedding quality by comparing adaptation with typology-only, sociolinguistic-only, and combined embeddings; (2) pilot experiments testing gradient stability and scalability on controlled language subsets, including low-resource and morphologically complex languages; (3) curriculum learning schemes to progressively incorporate typological and sociolinguistic complexity for enhancing training stability. The approach explicitly targets rapid adaptation tasks typical in language translation and abstractive summarization scenarios relevant to diverse dialects and sociolects. This method uniquely blends structural and social linguistic insights within meta-learning, offering finer-grained, scalable language and language variety adaptation beyond current methodologies.",

This interdisciplinary approach advances NLP, linguistics, and language education, positioning the work as a novel bridge between language modeling and language development, fostering innovations that reflect how children and learners acquire morphosyntactic features in rare languages.",

The method involves the following steps: \n\n1) **Typological & Acquisition Feature Encoding:** We extract morphosyntactic typological data (e.g., morphological richness indices, dominant word orders) from WALS and supplement these with language acquisition stage markers inspired by developmental linguistics literature (e.g., stages of morphological complexity acquisition observed in children and second language learners). Corpus linguistic methods are used to derive usage-frequency statistics to contextualize features within naturalistic language exposure.\n\n2) **Multimodal Feature Embedding:** These heterogeneous features are embedded separately — typological features via normalized scalar embeddings, acquisition stages through ordinal embeddings reflecting developmental order, and corpus-based usage statistics via distributional vectors. We fuse them using a gated attention mechanism to form a joint, dynamic continuous prompt vector that reflects both linguistic structure and learner-relevant development.\n\n3) **Prompt Integration into Frozen LLMs:** The fused prompt vector is prepended as continuous input tokens in the embedding space to a frozen transformer-based multilingual model (e.g., XLM-R). Unlike standard prompt tuning, TIPT-Acq employs a modular prompt encoder network mapping raw typological-acquisition inputs to prompt vectors, allowing for interpretability and ablation studies.\n\n4) **Model Optimization:** During downstream task fine-tuning (e.g., sentiment analysis, NER), only the prompt encoder and task-specific heads are updated, preserving base model parameters. The method differs from adapter-based techniques by explicitly parameterizing typology and acquisition signals as tunable prompts rather than inserting layers, enabling lightweight, modular, and interpretable incorporation of language-specific inductive biases.\n\n5) **Operational Workflow & Validation:** We provide pseudocode and conceptual diagrams illustrating how inputs traverse the prompt encoder to produce prompts that guide model predictions, clarifying the influence of typological and acquisition signals. Visualizations of prompt vector activations during task inference will reveal how morphological richness and acquisition stage features affect representation dynamics.\n\nThis approach creates a mechanistically grounded, interpretable, and modular typology-acquisition prompt tuning paradigm novel among multilingual prompt tuning techniques, fostering enhanced adaptability for typologically diverse and low-resource languages informed by real language development phenomena.",

        "Motivation": "While embedding morpho-syntactic typology into knowledge graphs holds promise, prior methods largely treat typological features as static attributes, disregarding dynamic language processing constraints and cognitive principles such as the Now-or-Never bottleneck and language acquisition mechanisms. By integrating insights from language acquisition and real-time processing, we can design typology embeddings that not only capture static linguistic variation but also reflect dynamic, usage-driven grammatical cue learning processes. This enriched representation fundamentally advances the semantic coherence and cross-lingual reasoning capabilities of multilingual knowledge graphs, enabling them to better mirror human language understanding and support linguistically nuanced tasks across diverse languages.",

Our method leverages multi-view graph neural networks where one view encodes static typological signatures and the other models dynamic, usage-driven embeddings reflecting real-time language processing. A principled fusion layer integrates these views, ensuring preservation of critical linguistic distinctions while enabling downstream semantic tasks to benefit from cognitively plausible, adaptive typology representations. This approach enhances semantic link prediction and multilingual query resolution by more accurately reflecting core properties of language such as word order rules, transitivity patterns, and morpho-syntactic structures, thus improving robustness and interpretability across typologically varied languages.",

This gap causes inaccurate and culturally insensitive generation, hindering inclusive and respectful NLP applications.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work has separately addressed cognitive biases or engaged typological features, this research innovatively integrates cognitive social psychology constructs—specifically the stereotype content model—with linguistic typology insights grounded in sociolinguistics and generative linguistics. Unlike earlier approaches, it provides a principled, mechanistically explicit architecture that modulates token generation through typology-aware dynamic subnetworks and reinforcement learning guided by cognitive bias theories. This hybrid interdisciplinary approach leverages varieties of language and cultural practices to produce linguistically and culturally sensitive outputs, setting a new benchmark beyond existing bias mitigation and multilingual modeling strategies.",
        "Proposed_Method": "The proposed method comprises a three-part integrated architecture detailed as follows: (1) Stereotype Penalty Computation: We formalize stereotype presence as a continuous scalar penalty calculated using stereotype content model-based metrics annotated on sentence-level typologically diverse datasets. Formally, for generated text y conditioned on input x, penalty P(y|x) = \\sum_i w_i * BiasMetric_i(y,x), where BiasMetric_i represents stereotype dimensions (e.g., warmth, competence) normalized per typological profile and w_i are learned weights. (2) Typology-Aware Subnetwork: Typological features (morphosyntactic, phonological, and semantic category distributions) are encoded as vectors T extracted from linguistic databases (e.g., WALS) and embedded via a dedicated neural encoder. This embedding modulates the base LM's token probability distribution dynamically via gating: p'(t|context) = p(t|context) * g(T, context), where g is a learned function adjusting probabilities to respect sociocultural cues. (3) Reinforcement Learning with Cognitive Bias-Informed Rewards: A reward model R(y|x) integrates the stereotype penalty and fluency, R = \u00021 \u00021 P(y|x) + \u00022 \u00022 FluencyScore(y), with hyperparameters balancing fidelity and bias reduction. We implement Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) fine-tuning where policy gradients optimize generation minimizing stereotype presence while preserving linguistic quality. Algorithmic workflow: supervised fine-tuning with typology conditioning \u00021\u00021&gt; initial LM, then reinforcement tuning using R. These components synchronize through a pipeline enabling reproducibility: typological embeddings feed the subnetwork modulating token logits; stereotype penalties backpropagate loss gradients; reinforcement rewards guide long-term bias reduction. This explicit formalization, coupled with interdisciplinary linguistic theory, advances over generic bias mitigation by contextually encoding cultural-linguistic diversity and cognitive science principles into large-scale LLM training.",

Conduct ablation testing on each module. 4) Evaluation: Quantitatively assess bias mitigation effectiveness using stereotype presence reduction, typological feature retention, and baseline NLP task performance metrics (perplexity, BLEU). Qualitatively evaluate via expert reviews of generated text for cultural sensitivity and respectfulness with detailed criteria and inter-annotator agreement. 5) Stability and Risk Mitigation: Monitor training dynamics robustly. If stereotype penalty destabilizes training, implement fallback adversarial discriminator training or curriculum learning introducing stereotype counterexamples progressively. Adopt gradient clipping and adaptive learning rates to stabilize convergence. 6) Iterative Refinement: Update dataset annotations and model based on evaluation, fostering iterative improvement and community feedback cycles.",

Downstream, we design evaluation tasks in automated essay evaluation and heritage language education contexts, enabling formative feedback on rhetorical skill and cultural appropriateness.\n\nThis design clarifies methodological mechanisms, grounds the approach in cognitive and linguistic theory, and innovatively integrates globally linked concepts, maximizing novelty, feasibility, and societal relevance.",

Formally, CLAM modulates the standard self-attention weight matrix \\( A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n} \\) where \\(n\\) is sequence length, by incorporating cognitive bias estimates and typological priors as multiplicative and additive factors. Specifically, for query-key pairs \\((q_i,k_j)\\), CLAM computes adjusted attention weights:\n\n\\[\nA'_{ij} = \\frac{\\exp\\big( \\frac{(q_i W_Q)(k_j W_K)^T}{\\sqrt{d}} + B_{ij} + T_{ij} \\big)}{\\sum_{l=1}^n \\exp\\big( \\frac{(q_i W_Q)(k_l W_K)^T}{\\sqrt{d}} + B_{il} + T_{il} \\big)}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(W_Q, W_K\\) are learned projection matrices, \\(B_{ij}\\) is a bias term derived from the output of a separately trained cognitive bias estimator network (CBEN) informed by stereotype content model (SCM) datasets, and \\(T_{ij}\\) encodes typological similarity scores from metadata embedding layers. \n\nThe CBEN is a dedicated neural module pre-trained on SCM-annotated social psychology corpora to predict latent stereotype dimensions for tokens or phrases. Its outputs influence \\(B_{ij}\\) to attenuate attention weights that could reinforce negative stereotypes, quantified by a differentiable penalty integrated into the loss function to reduce bias propagation.\n\nVisual-textual cues come from a parallel image processing pipeline extracting language-specific orthographic and paralinguistic features (e.g., tone markers, script style). These features are embedded and fused with language typology embeddings to produce \\(T_{ij}\\), modulating attention towards typologically relevant context. This fusion is implemented through a cross-modal attention block preceding CLAM.\n\nTraining proceeds in a multi-task setting combining language modeling, stereotype bias reduction loss, and typological prediction objectives with weight disentanglement to ensure balanced optimization.

We present detailed pseudocode for the scheduling policy that samples batches proportional to a curriculum function combining complexity score and training loss, allowing flexible batching strategies. 3) Typology Embedding Module: A multitask LLM architecture is enhanced by a learnable typology embedding encoding the computed language feature vectors, concatenated with token embeddings to condition the model to typological properties explicitly. 4) Distributed Training Optimization: We formulate a load balancing algorithm that adapts the batch distribution to heterogeneous compute nodes with deadlines, minimizing idle times and ensuring timely progression through the curriculum.

This project aims to advance beyond current approaches by introducing a rigorously designed, cross-modal typology embedding framework embedding linguistic levels including phonological, grammatical, and pragmatic dimensions, inspired by concepts from the Routledge Handbook on multilingual communication and Applied Linguistics. By combining these typological features with dialogue act patterns and user demographics in a principled embedding space, conditioned via architectures that implement flexible multilingualism and multimodal communication practices, we position our research as a novel, foundational contribution to reducing socio-technical mismatches in multilingual dialogue systems.

Theoretical rationale is grounded in flexible multilingualism models emphasizing dynamic interaction of typology and language use. 5) Feedback Integration and Iterative Refinement System: Utilizes a hybrid feedback mechanism combining sparse user feedback and expert annotations processed through Bayesian update techniques and robust noise-handling algorithms to iteratively fine-tune both typology-conditioned and dialogue generation components. This includes a reliability-weighting schema to handle sparse and noisy real-world feedback prevalent in minoritized communities, maintaining system stability and cultural sensitivity.

        "Problem_Statement": "Current multilingual large language models (LLMs) inadequately incorporate multifaceted ethical frameworks from diverse disciplines such as psychology and health sciences, leading to persistent biases and fairness issues when operating across richly varied cultural contexts. Moreover, they lack mechanisms to reconcile conflicting or divergent ethical norms dynamically and contextually within a unified model.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work focuses on static embedding of ethical knowledge, this proposal advances novelty by integrating dynamic, context-sensitive ethical norm adaptation within multilingual LLMs. It innovatively includes underrepresented non-Western languages and leverages user sociocultural signals extracted from mobile social networks to adapt ethical representations in real time, thereby creating a more culturally nuanced and operationally feasible bias mitigation mechanism that surpasses existing approaches in scope and fidelity.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose constructing expansive, validated cross-disciplinary ethical knowledge graphs explicitly incorporating cultural nuances from both Western and non-Western sources. These graphs will be used to pretrain graph transformer models that generate normative embeddings capable of expressing ethical variations and conflicts. Conflicting norms are reconciled using a hierarchical multi-level attention mechanism that dynamically prioritizes ethical principles conditioned on input linguistic features, detected user sociocultural context derived from anonymized mobile social network usage patterns, and language-specific characteristics. Integration into multilingual LLMs occurs via continuous gating and modulation layers within the transformer architecture, enabling fluid ethical awareness adjustments rather than static fusion. This design ensures ethical consistency while allowing flexible adaptation across languages and cultural settings, operationalized without prohibitive computational overhead.",

For a user context inferred from mobile social network signals indicating progressive urban youth demographics, the response adjusts tone and norm prioritization accordingly, reflecting nuanced, context-sensitive ethical reasoning.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should dynamic ethical norm adaptation via integrated graph transformers degrade LLM inference efficiency or stability, we will pivot to a modular framework where ethical embeddings serve as an external, context-aware bias correction module. This module will use learned control signals informed by mobile social network-derived user context to post-process outputs, enabling flexible but computationally lighter ethical adjustments. We will evaluate trade-offs between integration complexity and bias mitigation effectiveness to inform practical deployment strategies."

This approach ensures alignment of LLM outputs with fairness constraints by explicitly modeling ambiguous and conflicting ethical principles using weighted prompt prototype vectors representing diverse cultural facets. Furthermore, inspired by federated learning, prompt updates from different language communities remain decentralized to respect data privacy while enabling cross-lingual knowledge transfer. This explicit and replicable pipeline includes transparent tracking of prompt generation steps, bias mitigation feedback metrics, and prompt adaptation logs.

This approach tackles the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating by harnessing recent advances from few-shot learning, offensive language detection, code-mixed text analysis, and cross-lingual sentiment analysis to create a comprehensive, end-to-end bias mitigation framework that dynamically adapts to evolving cultural and linguistic fairness norms, thus enabling robust and contextually appropriate AI deployment in diverse global digital communication environments.",

        "Problem_Statement": "Existing bias mitigation techniques for multilingual large language models (LLMs) inadequately serve low-resource languages and rarely integrate structured ethical knowledge with dynamic cross-lingual alignment, resulting in persistent unfairness and cultural insensitivity in generated outputs. Furthermore, the challenge of constructing culturally valid multilingual ethical knowledge graphs and ensuring adversarial training stability remains a critical barrier for practical bias correction across diverse linguistic contexts.",
        "Motivation": "While prior approaches attempt to fuse knowledge graphs and adversarial debiasing, this work addresses key gaps by innovatively combining self-supervised learning to dynamically enrich knowledge graph embeddings, and leveraging semantic interoperability frameworks to align and harmonize ethical norms across culturally diverse knowledge graphs. This synergy advances bias mitigation beyond current competitive methods by providing scalable, culturally aware, and computationally feasible mechanisms explicitly designed for low-resource languages within multilingual LLMs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multilingual transformer architecture augmented with dynamically enriched ethical knowledge graph embeddings, generated through self-supervised learning from massive multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs). Our method constructs initial multilingual ethical knowledge graphs from cross-cultural sources, then refines embeddings by harvesting semantic and contextual signals from unlabeled data via contrastive self-supervised objectives. Semantic interoperability frameworks map and align ethically relevant graph nodes across languages to ensure cultural fidelity and consistency. A stabilized adversarial training regime employs a bias discriminator network, monitored with intermediate evaluation checkpoints leveraging multilingual bias metrics and convergence criteria designed to detect training instabilities early. Resource-efficient training strategies, including parameter sharing and curriculum learning focusing on low-resource languages, ensure computational feasibility. This integrated approach enables real-time, cross-lingual bias correction that respects rich, culturally nuanced ethical norms while leveraging state-of-the-art multilingual pretrained models and graph-based constraints.",

The output language should fluidly incorporate nuanced contextual cues learned through self-supervised embedding enrichment, illustrating the framework's capacity for sensitive, fair cross-lingual bias mitigation.",

Alternatively, we will deploy post-generation bias filtering informed by the semantic interoperability aligned ethical knowledge graphs, employing rule-based and lightweight neural filters to remove residual biased content. Additionally, to manage computational costs, we will explore parameter-efficient tuning methods such as adapter modules or prompt-tuning focused on low-resource languages to maintain bias mitigation effectiveness with reduced resource consumption."

This gap constrains comprehensive interpretability and fairness assessment, hindering trustworthy deployment in multilingual contexts with diverse moral and cultural norms.",

This fusion enriches fairness metrics by embedding moral competence and culturally grounded value systems, distinguishing our framework from prior approaches that focus on statistical parity or demographic fairness alone. By leveraging multilingual benchmark datasets annotated with ethical and moral dimensions and combining them with cognitive pragmatics, we create a novel, human-centered semantic fairness evaluation pipeline that advances fairness evaluation for multilingual LLMs in a deeper, ethically informed manner. This advancement positions our approach as both theoretically novel and practically impactful in multilingual natural language understanding and AI ethics.",

The framework involves: (a) curating and expanding multilingual corpora with pragmatic and ethical annotations using semi-supervised and cross-lingual transfer learning to mitigate annotation sparsity for underrepresented languages, (b) fine-tuning multilingual LLMs incorporating these enriched annotations with carefully designed training protocols to maintain generalization and avoid overfitting, and (c) formulating composite bias metrics that quantify disparities in pragmatic, ethical, and moral competence-relevant dimensions across languages. Explainable AI methods will interpret bias sources, linking model behavior with human ethical cognition.

        "Problem_Statement": "Offensive language detection models for low-resource languages and dialects often exhibit significant bias due to data sparsity and skewed distributions. Existing augmentation strategies and classifiers inadequately capture culturally nuanced emotional context in language, which impairs fairness and detection robustness, thereby perpetuating unfairness in sensitive NLP applications across multilingual contexts.",
        "Motivation": "While adversarial augmentation and multilingual offensive language detection have garnered extensive research, prior approaches rarely incorporate affective computing to model the emotional nuances of offensive language, nor do they address overfitting risks inherent to synthetic data augmentation. By integrating linguistic fairness constraints quantitatively within generative models, enriched with affective and dialectal features, and by applying soft pruning in classifier networks, we aim to advance beyond competitive baselines. This approach uniquely enhances data representativeness and classifier robustness, addressing fairness and generalization challenges in low-resource multilingual offensive language detection.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel, text-centric adversarial augmentation framework combining linguistic fairness constraints, dialectal features, and affective computing to generate emotionally-aware synthetic corpora across multiple low-resource languages and dialects. Our GAN architecture consists of dual generators and discriminators: one generator synthesizes offensive text conditioned on dialect embeddings and affective emotion embeddings derived from pretrained affective computing models, while the other focuses on non-offensive counterparts. Discriminators evaluate not only textual realism but also adherence to fairness constraints encoded as quantitative metrics of demographic parity and emotion distribution balance. These fairness constraints are encoded as differentiable loss components incorporated into GAN training objectives to promote balanced generation across dialects and emotional tones. The model inputs are textual sequences augmented with learned dialectal and emotion embeddings, ensuring the output captures linguistic diversity and affective nuance. To stabilize adversarial training amid low-resource multilingual data, we incorporate techniques such as gradient penalty regularization, curriculum learning, and adaptive batch normalization per dialect. Downstream, we train multilingual large language model classifiers enhanced with soft pruning techniques that selectively reduce over-parameterized neurons associated with overfitting to synthetic data, facilitating improved generalization and robustness. This combined method, leveraging affective computing and soft pruning, sets our approach apart by producing balanced, emotionally nuanced data and robust classifiers that directly target fairness and performance challenges in multilingual offensive language detection.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Aggregate existing offensive language corpora across high-resource and several low-resource languages, annotating or inferring dialectal variations and emotional tone labels using affective computing tools. 2) Establish baseline multilingual offensive language detection models without augmentation. 3) Develop and train the dual-generator GAN incorporating dialect embeddings, affective emotion embeddings (from pretrained emotion recognition systems), and quantitative fairness constraints as differentiable losses, applying adversarial training stabilization methods. 4) Generate synthetic multilingual datasets balancing dialect representation and emotional distributions. 5) Retrain classifiers on augmented data integrating soft pruning strategies during training to mitigate overfitting. 6) Evaluate models on coverage, detection F1 scores, demographic parity metrics, equalized odds for dialect and emotional groups, and robustness under cross-dialect and cross-emotion test conditions. 7) Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of affective modeling and soft pruning on fairness and performance improvements.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Yoruba low-resource offensive language dataset with dialect and emotion annotations is augmented using the affect-aware GAN. Output: Detection models trained on augmented data exhibit increased F1 scores, reduced dialectal and emotional bias disparities (e.g., demographic parity difference <5%), and higher robustness under dialect-shift testing. Additional tests on Hindi and Nigerian Pidgin datasets verify cross-lingual generalization of affective constraints and pruning benefits.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If GAN adversarial training proves unstable or synthetic data quality is inadequate despite stabilization techniques, fallback includes relying on controlled back-translation augmented with emotion and dialect labeling and paraphrasing guided by affective computing tools to diversify data. Concurrently, incorporate stronger classifier regularization and alternative pruning methods such as magnitude-based pruning to maintain generalization and fairness."

This integration is novel in its precise architectural design and targeted fairness objectives, bridging gaps in both robustness and demographic parity in downstream NLP pipelines. Incorporating advances like self-supervised pre-training and gated recurrent units further enhances generalizability and interpretability over existing competitive approaches.",

(3) Cross-Modal Alignment Modules: Employing cross-attention mechanisms akin to vision-language transformers, textual and visual features are aligned using shared semantic embeddings and positional encodings, enabling early fusion at intermediate layers while preserving modality-specific representations. (4) Fusion Strategy: A hybrid fusion approach combining early fusion at intermediate encoder stages and late fusion via concatenation of modality-specific predictions refined through a graph neural network that models cross-modal dependencies and spatial context. (5) Bias Mitigation Mechanism: An adversarial domain adaptation framework wherein domain discriminators target demographic and language attributes to enforce invariant feature representations across demographics and languages. This is implemented as gradient reversal layers integrated within the shared embedding space encouraging fair segmentation. Additionally, self-supervised contrastive learning is used to strengthen modality alignment and robustness. The design choices are theoretically grounded in recent advances in multimodal learning, with ablation studies planned to validate the contributions of each component to accuracy and bias reduction.",

External knowledge graph embeddings further enrich node representations, forming a rich, multimodal graph structure. (2) Temporal-Relational Graph Encoding: We employ stacked Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) over node feature sequences aligned with a Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) tailored to handle heterogeneous edge types from multimodal signals. Specifically, temporal convolutions model sequential dynamics per node feature dimension, while R-GCN layers aggregate relational neighborhood information across graph snapshots. To tackle temporal-graph alignment, we synchronize graph updates with temporal windows and use cross-attention pooling mechanisms to fuse temporal and spatial embeddings robustly. (3) Federated Privacy-Preserving Training with Optimized Message Passing: The model is trained across clients using federated averaging enhanced by differential privacy noise calibrated specifically for relational message passing. We design a privacy-optimized message passing scheme that injects differential privacy-preserving noise in latent space post R-GCN aggregation, minimizing utility loss while preventing client data leakage through gradients or messages. This method incorporates adversarial robustness by integrating adversarial training on perturbed graph structures and augmenting differential privacy with gradient clipping and quantization techniques to balance privacy-utility trade-offs.

A major challenge hindering effective multimodal anomaly detection is the difficulty of reliably constructing unified representations that faithfully capture the complex semantic and structural interrelations across highly heterogeneous modalities such as vision, language, and code.

Model personalization layers adapt to local client data peculiarities. Federated transfer learning with a bi-level optimization framework aligns global and local model parameters, addressing client heterogeneity and expediting convergence.

        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant limitations in effectively generalizing across cognitive and emotional dimensions due to scarcity of linguistically diverse datasets that authentically encode psychological and cognitive states, compounded by stringent privacy concerns and legal frameworks (e.g., US civil rights and data protection laws). Existing synthetic data generation efforts rarely integrate detailed psychological constructs within rigorously privacy-preserving mechanisms that also satisfy legal audit requirements, restricting advances in personalized and context-aware language understanding.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing a competitive, underexplored nexus, this proposal advances the internal gap of integrating complex psychological wellbeing constructs into synthetic linguistic data generation with strong privacy and legal compliance guarantees. Distinct from prior works mainly focusing on generic synthetic text or differential privacy (DP) in isolation, PsychSynth+ tightly couples psychologically-informed latent priors within a novel generative architecture, explicitly articulating mechanistic implementations, and embedding audit-ready DP mechanisms aligned with civil rights law constraints to rigorously protect sensitive data while enhancing LLMs' cognitive-emotional generalization capabilities.",
        "Proposed_Method": "PsychSynth+ proposes a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture augmented with hierarchically structured psychologically-informed latent space priors. These priors are concretely instantiated as parametrized Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) over latent variables, where each component corresponds to a defined psychological state derived from validated cognitive ontologies and subjective wellbeing scales (e.g., PERMA model vectors). Specifically, psychological states are encoded as continuous vectors representing multi-dimensional constructs (mood, anxiety, memory patterns), which parameterize the means and covariances of GMM components to condition latent distributions. Semantic coherence is quantitatively enforced by augmenting the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) loss with a psycholinguistic semantic regularizer that computes intra- and inter-cluster cosine similarity in latent space, ensuring generated text aligns with expected psychological semantic spaces. Differential privacy is embedded via a gradient-perturbation mechanism following the moments accountant framework, with privacy budgets (ϵ, δ) rigorously managed per training epoch. Crucially, DP noise addition is architecturally partitioned to separately safeguard the psychological prior parameter learning and the decoder's generative updates, stabilizing training and preserving conditioning fidelity. To address legal compliance, an integrated computer audit module logs all privacy parameters and model access events, ensuring alignment with US civil rights data usage regulations and enabling transparent privacy audits.

Federated aggregation aggregates parameter-efficient updates (e.g., adapters or low-rank updates) to form a global model without centralized raw data access, preserving privacy. Interaction feedback loops are operationalized as periodic consistency checks and alignment signals exchanged asynchronously among clients, inspired by healthcare team iterative learning cycles. We rigorously validate the analogy through pilot simulations mapping healthcare collaboration metrics (e.g., information sharing efficacy) to continual learning retention measures, grounding the assumption in theory and experiment.

        "Problem_Statement": "Continual federated learning (FL) for personalized biomedical NLP across languages with scarce data faces significant challenges: catastrophic forgetting during continual model updates, heterogeneous and non-i.i.d. client distributions, linguistic diversity, and privacy risks from sensitive clinical data. Existing FL methods lack systematic mechanisms that jointly handle privacy preservation, continual adaptation, and language-specific personalization while rigorously quantifying privacy-utility trade-offs and mitigating forgetting, especially in low-resource biomedical language settings.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work explores continual FL and privacy separately, there is a compelling need for a principled approach that integrates language-specific regularization with differential privacy in a unified framework. Emphasizing rigorous mechanism design and evaluation in multilingual biomedical domains—particularly for low-resource languages like Thai—addresses critical gaps identified in federated continual learning, privacy, and multilingual adaptation fields. Our approach is designed to surpass competitive baselines with sophisticated continual learning algorithms by formalizing trade-offs and explicitly tackling client heterogeneity and non-i.i.d. issues through adaptive regularization, leading to improved personalization and robustness in privacy-sensitive healthcare NLP applications.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a federated continual learning system that jointly employs a mathematically formulated language-specific regularization and differential privacy-based noise injection adapted per client. \n\n1. **Mechanism Design:** Language-specific regularization terms are defined as penalties on deviations of the client model parameters from a language-adaptive reference embedding subspace derived from multilingual pretrained language models fine-tuned on biomedical corpora. This regularizer constrains updates to preserve critical linguistic features and prevent catastrophic forgetting during continual updates.\n\n2. **Differential Privacy Integration:** We incorporate client-wise differential privacy by adding calibrated Gaussian noise to local model gradients during each federated epoch, carefully integrating privacy accounting over continual rounds using Rényi Differential Privacy. The noise injection parameters adapt dynamically depending on the observed client data heterogeneity and privacy budget.\n\n3. **Client Heterogeneity Handling:** To address non-i.i.d. and personalized distributions, the regularization strength is modulated per client based on a similarity metric computed from historical representations, enhancing personalized forgetting prevention and knowledge transfer while respecting data distribution shifts.\n\n4. **Algorithmic Sketch:**\n   - At each round, clients perform local continual updates with language-specific regularization added as an extra loss term.\n   - Local gradients are clipped and Gaussian noise added to guarantee differential privacy.\n   - Clients synchronize updated models with the server via weighted aggregation considering client similarity.\n   - Privacy budgets and model drift are tracked continuously.\n\n5. **Integration of Few-Shot and Context Window Techniques:** To accommodate severely low-resource scenarios and leverage contextual biomedical information, the method incorporates few-shot adaptation via prompt-based fine-tuning on local data, enhanced with adaptive context window mechanisms from pretrained language models to maximize information extraction while remaining privacy-compliant.\n\nThe overall approach innovatively integrates continual learning, privacy-preserving mechanisms, multilingual linguistic constraints, and few-shot contextual adaptations into an end-to-end federated learning framework explicitly targeting realistic, heterogeneous biomedical NLP settings.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. **Datasets:** Utilize publicly accessible biomedical datasets such as MIMIC-III for English, and extend to multilingual biomedical corpora including WikiAnn and MedMentions in Thai and other low-resource languages. Where data scarcity exists, simulate client distributions by partitioning and temporal slicing to reflect real clinical note arrivals.\n\n2. **Time-sequenced Simulation:** Create a chronological data stream per client simulating non-i.i.d and distribution shifts by manipulating disease prevalence, note types, and language usage over time.\n\n3. **Baselines:** Compare against (i) centralized continual learning without privacy; (ii) standard federated learning (FedAvg); (iii) federated continual learning without language regularization; (iv) federated continual learning with privacy but no adaptive regularization; (v) recent state-of-the-art continual FL methods incorporating replay buffers or proximal terms.\n\n4. **Privacy Budget Management:** Implement rigorous privacy tracking over continual rounds using the Rényi Differential Privacy accountant, systematically testing privacy budgets (ε) and their impact on utility.\n\n5. **Metrics:** Evaluate performance via continual NER and biomedical text classification accuracy over time, quantify forgetting using backward transfer metrics, measure model stability by variance in performance across rounds, and report formal privacy guarantees.\n\n6. **Ablation Studies:** Test sensitivity to regularization strength, noise scale, and client heterogeneity parameters.\n\n7. **Reproducibility:** Release code, data partitions, and privacy accounting scripts with clear documentation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sequential arrival of new clinical notes in Thai and English with fluctuating disease mentions and note styles.\nOutput: Client models continually updated improve named entity recognition and disease classification accuracy without leakage of prior sensitive data. Models preserve language-specific biomedical terminology and avoid catastrophic forgetting observed in baseline methods. Privacy budgets are maintained within predefined limits across continual rounds, demonstrating the method’s effective trade-off between privacy and utility.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the imposed privacy noise excessively impairs model utility, we will explore adaptive clipping and noise scaling strategies dynamically tuned per client and per round, leveraging feedback from privacy-utility trade-off metrics. Further, we will incorporate lightweight local replay buffers with synthetic data generated by differentially private generative models to reinforce forgetting prevention without compromising privacy. Should language-specific regularization prove unstable under severe heterogeneity, alternative modular regularization strategies such as meta-learned adapters or parameter-efficient tuning via prompt-based few-shot learning will be considered to enhance personalization more robustly."

Privacy-preserving knowledge distillation across modalities and languages remains underexplored, particularly under strict encryption and resource constraints.",
        "Motivation": "Bridging this critical gap, our work focuses on a rigorous, scalable framework for federated multimodal and multilingual adaptation that explicitly addresses alignment and privacy in knowledge distillation under strict encryption, heterogeneous data distributions, and edge device computational limits. By integrating structured EHR data alongside unstructured clinical text and images, and tailoring Transformer-based language models for low-resource hospital edge nodes, we aim to push the frontier beyond existing unimodal or non-resource-aware approaches. This elevates the contribution from merely multimodal FL to a practically deployable, privacy-first, and widely applicable healthcare AI solution with enhanced linguistic and modality generalization.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a secured, modular federated distillation framework that aligns and fuses unimodal representations across modalities (clinical text, diagnostic images, EHR) and languages via a multi-stage approach: \n\n1. **Local Unimodal Model Training**: Each edge client trains modality-specific encoders incorporating lightweight Transformer-based backbones optimized for resource-constrained environments. Structured EHR features are encoded with tailored embedding modules capturing clinical semantics.\n\n2. **Encrypted Soft-Label Exchange with Homomorphic Encryption**: Clients generate soft-label outputs and project them into a privacy-respecting embedding space. These embeddings are encrypted using homomorphic encryption schemes to allow the central server to perform aggregation and cross-modal alignment without plaintext exposure, preserving data confidentiality.\n\n3. **Cross-Modal and Cross-Lingual Alignment Module**: The server employs a privacy-aware cross-modal distillation process using gated attention mechanisms that fuse encrypted modality embeddings with auxiliary language embeddings, ensuring secure and robust alignment.\n\n4. **Federated Multimodal Language Adaptation**: Language embeddings are learned jointly with modality representations, employing federated optimization that respects communication bandwidth constraints and computational limits, enabling effective multilingual adaptation.\n\n5. **Communication Optimization and Edge Deployment Strategies**: Employ model quantization, sparsification, and adjustable update frequencies to fit communication budgets and computational limits of clinical edge devices.\n\nThis methodological design is supported by a detailed schematic depicting secure embedding, encryption, and fusion pipelines to demonstrate feasibility and soundness in real-world biomedical federated environments.",

Where datasets lack pairing or privacy constraints impede sharing, simulate realistic data distributions with synthetic EHR and imaging data using privacy-preserving generative models.\n\n2. **Preprocessing Pipelines**: Develop standardized modality-specific pipelines including tokenization for multiple languages, image normalization and augmentation, and clinical feature extraction from EHRs. Implement consistent modality alignment schemas.\n\n3. **Baseline Models**: Implement unimodal FL baselines and multimodal FL without encryption or with naïve distillation for comparative analysis.\n\n4. **Proposed Framework Implementation**: Deploy local modality encoders and encrypted soft-label generation on resource-constrained edge device simulators.

Evaluate privacy preservation with formal privacy leakage metrics under encryption schemes. Assess linguistic adaptation quality via cross-lingual transfer gains and robustness. Measure communication cost, latency, and computational efficiency to validate edge feasibility.\n\n6. **Ablation Studies**: Test impacts of encryption parameters, embedding fusion strategies, and resource constraints on performance and privacy.\n\n7. **Statistical Validation**: Use cross-validation and significance testing to ensure robustness.",

        "Fallback_Plan": "If homomorphic encryption overhead limits scalability, investigate hybrid secure aggregation methods combining differential privacy and cryptographic masking to balance privacy and efficiency. If cross-modal alignment under encryption proves ineffective, explore hierarchical federated learning where modalities are aligned at intermediate aggregation nodes before global fusion. If edge device constraints prove too stringent, consider offloading heavier computations to proximate fog nodes with secure channels.

Existing approaches insufficiently address simultaneous architectural optimization across multiple biomedical modalities and languages under these complex constraints.",
        "Motivation": "While federated learning (FL) and neural architecture search (NAS) have been explored independently, few studies integrate resource-aware NAS frameworks tailored for multilingual biomedical data under real federated constraints. Furthermore, current methods rarely exploit domain-specific pre-training or multimodal biomedical data fusion within FL-NAS, limiting both novelty and practical utility. This proposal aims to bridge these gaps by leveraging domain-specific biomedical text embeddings and incorporating multimodal signals (e.g., electronic health records and retinal nerve fiber layer images) into a unified federated NAS framework that pragmatically addresses device heterogeneity, communication efficiency, privacy preservation, and NAS convergence challenges. This integration enhances both scientific novelty and healthcare impact, providing scalable, lightweight, and accurate multilingual biomedical foundation models for clinical NLP and vision tasks.",

Linguistic heterogeneity, highly disparate and limited language resources, strict data privacy constraints, and semantic discrepancies in biomedical terminologies impede effective cross-lingual knowledge sharing and model personalization.

This enhances cross-lingual knowledge transfer and personalization in a privacy-preserving manner, overcoming limitations of conventional federated NLP methods.

Existing pruning schemes do not reliably incorporate validated linguistic relevance, risking degraded model utility and fairness, especially for underrepresented languages. Hence, there is a critical need for a pruning method that is not only communication-efficient but also rigorously grounded in empirically validated linguistic importance metrics to ensure robust and fair adaptation across diverse biomedical language clients.",
        "Motivation": "While model pruning and federated learning independently address resource and privacy challenges, their integration with linguistic adaptation remains underexplored and has critical assumptions unverified, leading to potential inaccuracies and unfairness in biomedical NLP applications. This work introduces an empirically grounded linguistic importance assessment phase within federated pruning, fortified by a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN)-based importance scorer trained on distilled multilingual biomedical datasets. By grounding pruning decisions in validated importance scores and dynamically adapting pruning granularity according to multilingual data heterogeneity and client resources, this framework fundamentally advances federated pruning beyond existing competitive baselines. The approach explicitly aligns communication efficiency gains with fairness and accuracy retention, targeting scalable federated biomedical NLP with complex linguistic nuances. Integrating dataset distillation and CNN-based scoring enhances reliability and resource feasibility compared to prior heuristic or unvalidated importance assumptions, positioning this method competitively for premier ML/NLP forums.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a three-stage federated pruning protocol: (1) Linguistic Importance Calibration – a lightweight CNN-based importance scoring model trained centrally on distilled multilingual biomedical samples assesses linguistic relevance for model components, validated using cross-client consistency metrics and ablation. This empirical foundation addresses the key assumption gap about importance score reliability in noisy, heterogeneous biomedical NLP contexts. (2) Adaptive Federated Pruning – clients utilize the calibrated importance scores to prune locally, dynamically adjusting pruning granularity based on local data size, compute resources, and importance confidence, guided by a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based controller predicting optimal pruning rates per federated round. (3) Weighted Aggregation with Linguistic-Aware Weights – server aggregates client updates using adaptive weights computed from validated importance scores and fairness metrics, employing statistical parity and worst-group performance evaluations to ensure model equity across languages. The protocol uses quantization as a systematic fallback, triggered by intermediate evaluation metrics not meeting utility thresholds. This method incorporates dataset distillation to reduce communication loads and CNN-based importance scoring to enhance robustness. Experimental reproducibility is ensured through fully specified scoring, aggregation, and fallback criteria, addressing prior underspecifications.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Pretraining phase: Use dataset distillation on multilingual biomedical corpora (e.g., MIMIC, Spanish clinical notes, and others) to create lightweight distilled sets. Train and validate the CNN-based importance scoring model on these sets, evaluating the stability and cross-client consistency of importance scores with ablation studies; confirm no bias against minor languages using fairness metrics. 2) Prototype federated pruning: Deploy the CNN scorer on simulated federated clients with variable data distributions and compute capacities; implement the GRU controller for dynamic pruning granularity adaptation. 3) Run federated learning rounds on large LLaMA descendants and smaller foundation models, comparing vanilla FL, pruning without linguistic awareness, and the proposed method. Measure communication cost, overall and per-language accuracy (including Named Entity Recognition), fairness metrics (statistical parity gap, worst-group accuracy), and model robustness. 4) Conduct fallback trigger experiments: systematically induce fallback pruning or quantization when validation metrics decline, recording effects on accuracy and communication. 5) Perform ablation on aggregation weighting schemes and importance score thresholds for robust conclusions. Resource consumption and scalability will be monitored and reported for all model variants to ensure feasibility and generalizability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Federated setup with heterogeneous clients having Spanish radiology reports and English clinical notes. CNN-based importance scorer identifies relevant neurons and layers per language corpus. Expected Output: The pruned model update reduces communication by over 70% compared to full model transmission, while maintaining or surpassing baseline NER accuracy (within a 1% margin) and exhibiting improved worst-language group fairness (statistical parity gap reduced by at least 15%) relative to non-linguistic pruning baselines.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should CNN importance scores demonstrate instability or degrade minority language utility, fallback involves reverting to a purely structured pruning approach governed by client compute availability only, skipping linguistic weighting. Quantization schemes will be employed as a secondary fallback if pruning alone compromises accuracy or fairness, dynamically triggered via monitored intermediate evaluation metrics during federated rounds. All fallback decisions and criteria will be transparently logged, with subsequent strategies iteratively refined based on comprehensive ablation feedback from experimental phases to ensure robustness without sacrificing key communication efficiency or fairness goals."
