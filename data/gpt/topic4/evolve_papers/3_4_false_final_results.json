    "title": "Temporal Graph Anomaly Networks for Longitudinal Linguistic Vulnerability Evolution Detection",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current anomaly detection lacks modeling of temporal evolution in graph-structured linguistic and code data, hindering timely detection of emerging vulnerabilities or biases evolving over time in LLM datasets.",
    "Motivation": "By integrating temporal sequence modeling with graph neural networks, this idea addresses the external gap concerning underrepresentation of temporal and sequential dependencies in anomaly detection pipelines, creating a framework to monitor and predict evolving anomalies longitudinally over graph-structured multimodal data streams.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We develop Temporal Graph Anomaly Networks (T-GANs) that encode sequences of heterogeneous graphs extracted from evolving linguistic, visual, and code data using temporal graph convolutions and attention mechanisms. The architecture models temporal changes in graph topology and node features to identify unusual temporal semantic shifts indicating emerging anomalies or vulnerabilities. An unsupervised anomaly score aggregates temporal deviations to pinpoint suspicious evolution patterns.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect temporal multimodal datasets with emerging anomalies injected at known timestamps. 2) Construct sequence of multimodal graphs over time. 3) Implement T-GAN with temporal graph convolutions and attention. 4) Train unsupervisedly using reconstruction or predictive tasks across graph sequences. 5) Evaluate early detection capability, temporal precision, and recall. 6) Compare with static and non-temporal graph anomaly models.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A timeline of codebase snapshots with incremental introduction of security vulnerabilities alongside evolving documentation images and text. Expected Output: The model detects gradual anomaly escalation aligned with vulnerability introduction timepoints for proactive mitigation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If temporal graph convolutions fail to generalize, investigate recurrent graph neural networks or hybrid temporal-static graph models. Alternatively, enhance temporal data with domain-informed graph augmentations or metadata features."
