Using English as a hub language for such languages, cross-lingual sentiment analysis has been developed. The sheer quantity of English language resources raises questions about its status as the primary resource. This research aims to examine the impact on sentiment analysis of adding data from same-family versus distant-family languages. We analyze the performance using low-resource and high-resource data from the same language family (Slavic), investigate the effect of using a distant-family language (English) and report the results for both settings. Quantitative experiments using multi-task learning demonstrate that adding a large quantity of data from related and distant-family languages is advantageous for cross-lingual sentiment transfer.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Deep transfer learning baselines for sentiment analysis in Russian', 'abstract': 'Recently, transfer learning from pre-trained language models has proven to be effective in a variety of natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis. This paper aims at identifying deep transfer learning baselines for sentiment analysis in Russian. Firstly, we identified the most used publicly available sentiment analysis datasets in Russian and recent language models which officially support the Russian language. Secondly, we fine-tuned Multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), RuBERT, and two versions of the Multilingual Universal Sentence Encoder and obtained strong, or even new, state-of-the-art results on seven sentiment datasets in Russian: SentRuEval-2016, SentiRuEval-2015, RuTweetCorp, RuSentiment, LINIS Crowd, and Kaggle Russian News Dataset, and RuReviews.

To facilitate the selection of suitable DLT designs, we review DLT characteristics and identify trade-offs between them. Furthermore, we assess how DLT designs account for these trade-offs and we develop archetypes for DLT designs that cater to specific requirements of applications on DLT. The main purpose of our article is to introduce scientific and practical audiences to the intricacies of DLT designs and to support development of viable applications on DLT.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'MadMax: surviving out-of-gas conditions in Ethereum smart contracts', 'abstract': 'Ethereum is a distributed blockchain platform, serving as an ecosystem for smart contracts: full-fledged inter-communicating programs that capture the transaction logic of an account. Unlike programs in mainstream languages, a gas limit restricts the execution of an Ethereum smart contract: execution proceeds as long as gas is available. Thus, gas is a valuable resource that can be manipulated by an attacker to provoke unwanted behavior in a victim\\'s smart contract (e.g., wasting or blocking funds of said victim). Gas-focused vulnerabilities exploit undesired behavior when a contract (directly or through other interacting contracts) runs out of gas. Such vulnerabilities are among the hardest for programmers to protect against, as out-of-gas behavior may be uncommon in non-attack scenarios and reasoning about it is far from trivial. In this paper, we classify and identify gas-focused vulnerabilities, and present MadMax: a static program analysis technique to automatically detect gas-focused vulnerabilities with very high confidence. Our approach combines a control-flow-analysis-based decompiler and declarative program-structure queries. The combined analysis captures high-level domain-specific concepts (such as \"dynamic data structure storage\" and \"safely resumable loops\") and achieves high precision and scalability. MadMax analyzes the entirety of smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain in just 10 hours (with decompilation timeouts in 8% of the cases) and flags contracts with a (highly volatile) monetary value of over $2.8B as vulnerable. Manual inspection of a sample of flagged contracts shows that 81% of the sampled warnings do indeed lead to vulnerabilities, which we report on in our experiment.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'An Empirical Analysis of Traceability in the Monero Blockchain', 'abstract': 'Abstract\\n                  Monero is a privacy-centric cryptocurrency that allows users to obscure their transactions by including chaff coins, called “mixins,” along with the actual coins they spend. In this paper, we empirically evaluate two weaknesses in Monero’s mixin sampling strategy. First, about 62% of transaction inputs with one or more mixins are vulnerable to “chain-reaction” analysis - that is, the real input can be deduced by elimination. Second, Monero mixins are sampled in such a way that they can be easily distinguished from the real coins by their age distribution; in short, the real input is usually the “newest” input. We estimate that this heuristic can be used to guess the real input with 80% accuracy over all transactions with 1 or more mixins. Next, we turn to the Monero ecosystem and study the importance of mining pools and the former anonymous marketplace AlphaBay on the transaction volume. We find that after removing mining pool activity, there remains a large amount of potentially privacy-sensitive transactions that are affected by these weaknesses. We propose and evaluate two countermeasures that can improve the privacy of future transactions.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Distributed Ledger Technology', 'abstract': 'Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is one of the most promising innovations in the field of information technologies with the potential to change organization and collaboration in the economy, society, and industry.

It presents the major innovations originating from distributed ledger technology since the introduction of the blockchain concept. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies’ historical background as a driver of fully decentralized distributed ledgers is outlined from their origins in the 1990s until the blockchain concept’s introduction in 2009. DLT’s technical principles are introduced to provide a sound understanding. Subsequently, the functioning of distributed ledger technology is illustrated by means of the Bitcoin blockchain example, which was the first fully decentralized cryptocurrency to not require a trusted authority (i.e., banks).

We now face a critical need for such innovation, as personalization and data science prompt patients to engage in the details of their healthcare and restore agency over their medical data. In this paper, we propose MedRec: a novel, decentralized record management system to handle EMRs, using blockchain technology. Our system gives patients a comprehensive, immutable log and easy access to their medical information across providers and treatment sites. Leveraging unique blockchain properties, MedRec manages authentication, confidentiality, accountability and data sharing– crucial considerations when handling sensitive information. A modular design integrates with providers' existing, local data storage solutions, facilitating interoperability and making our system convenient and adaptable. We incentivize medical stakeholders (researchers, public health authorities, etc.) to participate in the network as blockchain “miners”. This provides them with access to aggregate, anonymized data as mining rewards, in return for sustaining and securing the network via Proof of Work. MedRec thus enables the emergence of data economics, supplying big data to empower researchers while engaging patients and providers in the choice to release metadata.

It solves several problems related to increasing the effectiveness of opinion classification. The first problem is related to lexicon labelling. Human labelling in the field of emotions is often too subjective and ambiguous, and so the possibility of replacement by automatic labelling is examined. This paper offers experimental results using a nature-inspired algorithm—particle swarm optimization—for labelling. This optimization method repeatedly labels all words in a lexicon and evaluates the effectiveness of opinion classification using the lexicon until the optimal labels for words in the lexicon are found. The second problem is that the opinion classification of texts which do not contain words from the lexicon cannot be successfully done using the lexicon-based approach. Therefore, an auxiliary approach, based on a machine learning method, is integrated into the method. This hybrid approach is able to classify more than 99% of texts and achieves better results than the original lexicon-based approach. The final hybrid model can be used for emotion analysis in human–robot interactions.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Thumbs up?: sentiment classification using machine learning techniques', 'abstract': 'We consider the problem of classifying documents not by topic, but by overall sentiment, e.g., determining whether a review is positive or negative.

However, the three machine learning methods we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classification as on traditional topic-based categorization. We conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classification problem more challenging.'}]\n```\n\n**Part A.2: The Evolution Links (Edges of the Graph):**\nThe following list defines the citation relationships between the papers in Part A.

    "title": "Research Landscape Map on Incorporating Linguistic Typology into LLM Training to Enhance Diversity Representation",
    "current_research_landscape": "The current research landscape centers on advancing cross-lingual sentiment analysis, particularly leveraging English language resources and transfer learning baselines built upon multilingual language models such as multilingual BERT. The dominant methodology involves multi-task learning for knowledge transfer within and across same-family languages, addressing limitations in resource-poor languages by exploiting related language data. This approach evolved in response to earlier works showcasing the effectiveness of lexicon-based and traditional machine learning sentiment classification techniques but highlighting challenges in domain adaptation and limited coverage for low-resource languages. Concurrently, distributed ledger technology (DLT) research, focusing on Ethereum smart contracts and static program analysis, represents a parallel thematic cluster with limited direct intersection to NLP. However, bridge concepts such as smart contracts suggest emerging interdisciplinary potential. Local concept clusters reflect a bifurcated focus: one on deep language modeling and sentiment transfer technology and another on DLT design and application trade-offs.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internally, the field shows significant gaps in truly integrating linguistic typology — i.e., systematic cross-linguistic structural features — into multilingual large language model training, limiting the representation diversity beyond family-related transfer methods that rely heavily on English-centric resources. There is scant attention to non-Indo-European and typologically distant languages that possess unique morphological and syntactic features. Moreover, current transfer learning strategies inadequately address typological diversity effects on model generalization and bias. Externally, the global context reveals overlooked opportunities in leveraging cross-disciplinary insights connecting English language resources and language models with application requirements from domains like healthcare and education, especially in low-resource contexts. Similarly, there is unexploited synergy potential between natural language processing and decentralized systems such as blockchain-enabled data sharing and privacy (notably through Ethereum smart contracts), which remain unexplored for managing linguistic data governance and protecting native speakers’ data rights. The bridging concepts identified via Ethereum smart contracts also hint at novel privacy-preserving machine learning workflows that can enhance linguistic diversity representation while ensuring secure data sharing.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "1. Typology-Aware Multilingual Model Training: Develop new pretraining and transfer learning frameworks that explicitly incorporate typological features (e.g., morphological richness, word order typology) into language models. This addresses internal gaps by moving beyond English-centric cross-lingual transfer to more equitable representation for typologically diverse, low-resource languages, enhancing sentiment and downstream task performance. 2. Cross-Disciplinary Integration of NLP with Decentralized Data Governance: Build on the global insight linking English language resources, application requirements, and Ethereum smart contracts to create blockchain-based platforms that allow secure, privacy-preserving sharing and auditing of linguistic datasets. Such systems can incentivize community participation, protecting indigenous and minority language data while facilitating large-scale model training with diverse typological inputs. 3. Application-Driven Linguistic Resource Development: Leverage gaps between language model capabilities and real-world application demands in health, education, and social services (highlighted in the global context) to create typology-informed datasets and evaluation benchmarks. These resources would support transfer learning approaches better tailored to specific linguistic and socio-cultural needs, addressing both methodological and ethical gaps in current research."
