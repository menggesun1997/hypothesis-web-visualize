    "Problem_Statement": "Anomaly and vulnerability detection systems for LLM training data are siloed across modalities—vision-language or code—resulting in missed cross-modal semantic anomalies important for comprehensive linguistic data security and quality assurance.",
    "Motivation": "The project directly addresses the external gap of siloed modality-specific anomaly detection by leveraging the hidden bridge of graph neural networks (GNNs) as unifying structures to integrate multimodal knowledge and anomalies from vision, language, and code sources, fulfilling high-potential innovation opportunity #2 from the landscape analysis.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a cross-modal graph neural network architecture that constructs a unified heterogeneous graph with nodes representing visual elements, textual tokens, and code constructs (e.g., AST nodes or code property graph components) extracted from LLM training datasets. GNN layers model semantic and structural relationships across modalities capturing complex anomaly interactions. An unsupervised anomaly scoring mechanism identifies outliers in this multimodal graph embedding space, highlighting joint anomalies potentially overlooked by modality-isolated systems.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Prepare multimodal datasets combining images with captions and code snippets. 2) Extract vision features with CNNs, textual embeddings via transformers, and code graphs through code analysis. 3) Construct heterogeneous graphs encoding cross-modal relations. 4) Implement and train GNN anomaly detection models (e.g., graph autoencoders) unsupervisedly. 5) Evaluate anomaly detection performance on synthetic and real-world multimodal anomalies using ROC AUC, precision-recall, and qualitative case studies. 6) Benchmark against modality-isolated baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A multimodal sample consisting of an image containing text, paired with source code embedding an intentional semantic vulnerability. Expected Output: The system flags the joint anomaly involving corrupt visual-textual semantics and code vulnerability at corresponding graph nodes, indicating hidden multi-source risks.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If the unified graph representation becomes too complex or noisy, decompose training into modality-pairwise subnetworks with cross-attention layers. Alternatively, focus on graph regularization and pruning to improve meaningful cross-modal connectivity."

        "title": "Robust Cross-Modal Graph Neural Networks for Multimodal Anomaly Detection in Vision, Language, and Code Domains with Adaptive Integration and Expert-in-the-Loop Validation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current anomaly and vulnerability detection systems for large language model (LLM) training data are predominantly modality-specific—either analyzing vision-language data or code separately—leading to missed subtle anomalies that span these modalities. A major challenge hindering effective multimodal anomaly detection is the difficulty of reliably constructing unified representations that faithfully capture the complex semantic and structural interrelations across highly heterogeneous modalities such as vision, language, and code. Without addressing core semantic alignment and graph construction soundness, anomaly detection models risk generating noisy or spurious signals, undermining linguistic data security and quality assurances.",
        "Motivation": "This research targets a foundational gap in multimodal anomaly detection by critically re-examining and advancing the core assumptions behind unified graph neural network (GNN) approaches. While prior work has explored multi-view or modality-pairwise graph fusion, our approach innovates by developing an adaptive, hierarchical cross-modal graph construction methodology with principled alignment heuristics and modular fallback mechanisms to ensure robust semantic correspondence and mitigate noise in heterogeneous graph embeddings. Integrating concepts from intelligent decision-making and semantic communication, and addressing domain-specific aspects such as vulnerability detection in code paired with vision-language data, this project aims to establish a scientifically rigorous, scalable, and interpretable anomaly detection framework that substantially surpasses modality-isolated and naive fusion baselines in accuracy, robustness, and explainability.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel, two-stage method emphasizing robust semantic alignment and adaptive integration to overcome foundational challenges in unified multimodal graph construction:\n\n1) **Adaptive Cross-Modal Graph Construction:**\n- Extract modality-specific features: CNN-based visual embeddings, transformer-derived text token embeddings, and code property graphs capturing syntactic and semantic code structures.\n- Employ alignment heuristics grounded in semantic embeddings and metadata (e.g., image-caption-code referencing timestamps, identifiers) to establish reliable cross-modal node correspondences.\n- Integrate graph sparsification and pruning strategies to discard noisy or weakly supported edges, leveraging node embedding similarity thresholds informed by preliminary embedding validation.\n- Construct a hierarchical heterogeneous graph where modality-specific subgraphs connect via validated cross-modal edges, preserving granularity differences.\n\n2) **Flexible Graph Neural Network Modeling:**\n- Implement a modular GNN architecture combining graph autoencoders and attention-based cross-modal message passing that can dynamically adjust reliance on cross-modal connections based on their confidence scores.\n- Integrate embedding-level consistency losses and intermediate embedding validation to monitor and enforce alignment quality during training.\n- Develop an unsupervised anomaly scoring approach that accounts for both intra- and inter-modal anomalies, weighted by reliability of cross-modal links.\n\n3) **Fallback and Iterative Refinement Strategy:**\n- When unified graph construction falters due to complexity or noise, switch to modality-pairwise subnetworks with specialized cross-attention mechanisms, ensuring graceful degradation.\n- Iteratively refine alignment heuristics and graph topology based on expert feedback and embedding quality metrics.\n\n4) **Expert-in-the-Loop Evaluation and Semantic Metrics:**\n- Incorporate domain experts (e.g., code security analysts, vision-language specialists) in qualitative anomaly assessments.\n- Design novel evaluation metrics that capture cross-modal semantic coherence and joint anomaly impacts beyond traditional ROC AUC and precision-recall, inspired by narrative visualization and semantic communication measures.\n\nOur approach explicitly leverages advances in semantic communication theory to enhance node correspondence fidelity and intelligent decision-making principles to adaptively weight cross-modal information flow, fostering a robust, interpretable anomaly detection framework for complex multimodal LLM training corpora.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) **Preliminary Feasibility and Alignment Validation:**\n- Collect smaller-scale, domain-specific multimodal datasets combining images with captions and code snippets (e.g., medical image reports paired with associated analysis scripts).\n- Develop and empirically validate alignment heuristics, embedding similarity thresholds, and graph sparsification parameters using embedding quality metrics and preliminary anomaly proxies.\n\n2) **Hierarchical Graph Construction Prototype:**\n- Build modality-specific subgraphs and test integration via proposed cross-modal edges, iteratively refining based on embedding consistency losses and feedback.\n\n3) **GNN Model Development and Training:**\n- Implement modular GNN with adaptive cross-modal message passing and unsupervised anomaly scoring.\n- Employ embedding-level validation during training to monitor cross-modal alignment integrity.\n\n4) **Fallback Strategy Exploration:**\n- Develop modality-pairwise subnetwork models with cross-attention layers to compare against unified models.\n\n5) **Comprehensive Evaluation:**\n- Use synthetic and real-world multimodal anomaly datasets augmented by domain expert-in-the-loop qualitative assessments.\n- Evaluate using traditional metrics (ROC AUC, precision-recall) alongside novel semantic coherence and joint anomaly impact metrics.\n\n6) **Scalability and Resource Analysis:**\n- Monitor computational requirements at each stage; implement graph pruning and model optimizations to mitigate bottlenecks.\n\n7) **Iterative Refinement and Timeline:**\n- Allocate initial 3 months for alignment heuristic development and small-scale tests.\n- Months 4-7 for graph construction and GNN modeling.\n- Months 8-10 for fallback methods and scalability analyses.\n- Months 11-12 for evaluation, expert studies, and final refinements.\n\nThis iterative, risk-aware plan ensures feasibility and scientific rigor, reducing large-scale experiment risks.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A multimodal data instance comprising (a) an image containing medical visual information with embedded textual metadata, (b) its accompanying diagnostic report text, and (c) associated code scripts for image analysis embedding an intentional semantic vulnerability (e.g., a backdoor pattern in preprocessing).\n\nExpected Output: The system robustly identifies and flags a subtle joint anomaly where the corrupted visual-textual semantics and code vulnerability collaboratively impact the sample’s integrity. Diagnostic outputs highlight specific graph nodes and cross-modal edges revealing the anomaly’s multi-source nature, supporting transparent interpretation and expert review. Additionally, evaluations demonstrate improved detection accuracy and reduced false positives compared to modality-isolated systems and naive graph fusion baselines.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If unified heterogeneous graph construction encounters excessive noise or semantic misalignments that impair anomaly detection:\n\n- Transition to a fallback pipeline deploying modality-pairwise subnetworks (vision-language, language-code) trained with cross-attention layers designed to capture intermodal interactions without full unification.\n- Employ progressive graph pruning and regularization to simplify graphs while preserving critical cross-modal signals.\n- Utilize embedding-level validation checkpoints to detect degradation early and adjust model complexity.\n- Introduce expert-in-the-loop feedback cycles iteratively refining alignment heuristics and graph topology.\n\nThis adaptive fallback mechanism is integrated into the main method narrative as a transparent risk mitigation strategy, ensuring anomaly detection validity despite foundational challenges in cross-modal fusion. The fallback plan also serves as an experimental comparative baseline quantifying the benefits and limitations of the unified approach versus modular alternatives, thereby strengthening the overall research contribution and practical relevance."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that a single heterogeneous graph can effectively capture complex semantic and structural relationships across highly disparate modalities—vision, language, and code—within LLM training data. This assumption merits deeper justification and empirical grounding, as differences in representation granularity, noise, and semantic alignment across modalities may challenge unified graph construction and embedding. The proposal should better clarify how semantic alignment and cross-modal node correspondence will be robustly established, especially for subtle anomalies involving multiple modalities, to ensure soundness of this foundational assumption in the proposed method's design. Without this clarity, the approach risks oversimplifying multimodal integration, leading to noisy or spurious anomaly signals in the graph domain. Consider discussing computational and conceptual strategies to validate and refine cross-modal graph topology before anomaly detection training, such as alignment heuristics, graph sparsification, or intermediate embedding validation steps to strengthen soundness here in future development stages and experiments targeting foundational soundness questions early on in the research workflow, beyond initial novelty screening stages that primarily assess idea overlap and incremental novelty only. This is critical for a competitive multimodal anomaly detection area where rigorous modeling of intermodal relations is key and impactful novelty could be compromised by weak core assumptions underlying the proposed unified graph representation approach.  To further shape this, compare and contrast with related cross-modal GNN studies, highlighting how your assumption diverges or innovates on established multi-view graph fusion techniques for anomaly detection. Overall, more explicit, in-depth rationale and preliminary feasibility analysis focusing on this assumption should precede downstream experimental commitments to ensure foundational soundness of the overall approach. This must be addressed prior to investing in large-scale experiments and benchmarking, or substantial codebase development to maintain project rigor and impact potential. Target your explanation at top-tier conference reviewers and readers less familiar with cross-modal graph modeling challenges to solidify confidence in your foundational model assumptions early on in the submission narrative and method sections. This aligns also with the stated fallback strategy you might strengthen by making fallback elaboration an integral part of the main method narrative explaining when and why the unified graph construction would fail and how such failures impact anomaly identification validity, preferably with conceptual or preliminary experimental evidence. Such a transparent handling of your key assumption risks versus mitigations will boost credibility and soundness thoroughly, elevating the work’s standing amid highly competitive multimodal anomaly detection research lines. This critique is highest priority to resolve first, guaranteeing viability of your main technical premise before proceeding further with the proposed method pipeline as currently drafted. Addressing this adequately will greatly enhance overall robustness and clarity of your work, laying a strong solid foundation for the novel contributions and experimental demonstration elsewhere in the paper. Please revise your proposal accordingly to elaborate and support this core assumption more explicitly and critically, referencing relevant literature and preliminary studies where possible to bolster confidence early in review workflow stages for a top conference submission environment, consistent with your stated novelty and competitiveness context. Thank you! (If possible, consider illustrative examples of problematic scenarios and how your approach overcomes or gracefully handles them with thoughtful design choices.) It is essential to resolve this before progressing much further beyond initial conceptual stages or synthetic dataset experimentation to maximize impact potential and reduce risk of failed integration in real deployment or evaluation settings in your target application domain(s). Thanks for your attention to this critical aspect! (This is a deep foundational critique reflecting the core premise validity rather than peripheral implementation details.) Please address this first for high-impact outcome potential in your pioneering multimodal anomaly detection research line using GNNs across vision, language, and code modalities with unified graph representations and unsupervised anomaly scoring mechanisms as proposed here. We look forward to your updated treatment clarifying this key assumption in detail with supporting evidence and rationale in your revised proposal or manuscript version submitted to further review stages. Best wishes! (Second critique below is a complementary experimental feasibility concern.) Cheers! — Expert Area Chair Reviewer, ACL/NeurIPS-level."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed experiment plan, while thorough in steps, could face significant practical challenges due to the complexity and scale of integrating multimodal datasets spanning vision, language, and code, and constructing unified heterogeneous graphs with meaningful cross-modal edges. Notably, preparing realistic multimodal anomaly datasets combining images with captions and code snippets featuring semantic vulnerabilities is non-trivial — such datasets are scarce or do not exist publicly, and synthetic anomaly generation risks limited realism impacting generalization validity. Moreover, evaluating anomaly detection on this cross-modal graph embedding space using standard ROC AUC and precision-recall metrics alone may be insufficient to capture nuanced joint anomalies spanning modalities. The plan should consider incorporating domain expert-in-the-loop qualitative evaluation phases and design richer metrics sensitive to cross-modal semantic effects. Additionally, forecasting computational demands and optimization bottlenecks surrounding the construction, storage, and training on large heterogeneous graphs needs explicit attention to establish practical feasibility. The fallback strategy hints at this but should be formally integrated into the experimental plan as alternative pipelines should complexity or noise impede unified graph training. Recommending iterative prototyping phases focused on smaller-scale modality-pairwise subnetworks and progressive graph pruning to validate modeling assumptions and assess scalability before committing to full integrated training would materially improve feasibility and risk mitigation. Furthermore, a clear timeline and resource assessment for each experimental stage is needed to strengthen confidence in the plan’s implementability. Without these enhancements, the experiment plan risks underestimating the significant engineering challenges, potentially limiting the research outcomes’ rigor and reproducibility — especially critical when aiming for premier conference presentation where method feasibility and empirical robustness are heavily scrutinized. Addressing these feasibility concerns explicitly and refining the experiment plan accordingly will greatly increase confidence in your proposal’s practical pathway toward demonstrating the claimed advances in multimodal graph-based anomaly detection for LLM training datasets. This should be the second highest priority item to resolve after critical soundness improvements, enabling a well-scoped, feasible, and scientifically rigorous experimental validation. Thank you for your attention to these practical implementation considerations consistent with top-tier reviewing standards."
