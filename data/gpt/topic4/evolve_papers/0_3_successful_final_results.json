        "title": "Personalized Educational Chatbots in Underrepresented Languages Using Multilingual LLMs with Human-Centered Adaptive Interaction and Ethical Design",
        "Problem_Statement": "Personalized tutoring systems largely overlook learners who speak underrepresented languages, perpetuating educational inequities intensified by the scarcity of adaptive, culturally contextualized AI-driven tutoring content and interaction methods tailored to these learners' linguistic and pedagogical needs.",
        "Motivation": "While multilingual generative AI applications in education are advancing, there remains a critical gap in integrating human-computer interaction (HCI) theories and ethical AI principles specifically for underrepresented language learners. Our approach advances beyond existing educational AI by co-designing adaptive, dialogic interaction strategies informed by HCI research and by embedding ethical considerations such as bias mitigation, cultural sensitivity, and interpretability into the tutoring system’s core. This human-centered, culturally grounded methodology not only enhances learner engagement and outcomes but also aligns with educational practices and policy concerns, promoting equitable digital literacy and pedagogical skills development for diverse learners globally.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel adaptive conversational AI tutoring platform that synergistically integrates multilingual LLM capabilities with HCI-informed dialogic strategies and explicit ethical AI design principles. The system will be co-developed with educators, educational policymakers, and learners to ground curricula and interaction methods in culturally relevant pedagogical practices and dialogic human-computer interaction theory. User modeling incorporates linguistic proficiency, cultural context, and interaction readiness to dynamically tailor explanations, activities, and feedback. We will implement transparent model interpretability modules to expose decision rationales and bias auditing features. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) will be augmented by a structured human-in-the-loop annotation protocol emphasizing reliability and minimizing feedback noise and bias, supported by active learning techniques to efficiently manage scarce data. This human-centered approach fosters positive classroom-like interactions and supports pedagogical skills development, increasing adoption in authentic educational contexts.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collaborate with educational policy makers, researchers, and local educators to co-curate and validate culturally grounded curricula and dialogic interaction scripts in target underrepresented languages. 2) Employ active learning and crowdsourcing to expand data beyond curricula and scripted dialogues, ensuring linguistic diversity and cultural richness. 3) Develop detailed user profiling modules that integrate pedagogical readiness, cultural background, and interaction style using validated HCI frameworks. 4) Design and implement a robust human-in-the-loop annotation and feedback protocol with trained annotators from learner communities, applying bias mitigation strategies and measuring inter-annotator agreement to ensure reinforcement signals quality for RLHF. 5) Iteratively deploy dialogue systems in partnership with local educational institutions to collect real-world learner interactions. 6) Continuously refine the system using RLHF with transparent interpretability and bias auditing tools to monitor ethical compliance. 7) Evaluate effectiveness via quantitative learning outcome metrics, qualitative user satisfaction and engagement surveys, HCI usability assessments, and comprehensive bias and fairness analyses. 8) Develop fallback strategies beyond rule-based personalization layers, including semi-supervised learning fallback and meta-learning based adaptation to handle modeling or RLHF failures, ensuring robustness throughout deployment.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A secondary school learner engaging with the chatbot in Igbo asks for assistance understanding geometric transformations.\nExpected Output: The chatbot provides an explanation aligned to the learner's proficiency, using culturally relevant analogies grounded in local contexts (e.g., traditional crafts or spatial navigation). It adapts interaction pacing based on learner responses, offers dialogic questions to prompt active reflection, transparently explains model reasoning when requested, and monitors for potential culturally sensitive content issues, addressing them appropriately.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If user modeling or RLHF prove infeasible, deploy multi-tier fallback mechanisms: 1) A semi-supervised learning component leveraging unlabeled interaction data to maintain adaptation capability. 2) Meta-learning approaches to generalize personalization across similar learner profiles. 3) Enhanced rule-based personalization incorporating educator-provided heuristics to approximate adaptive behaviors. Concurrently, increase dataset size and diversity through ongoing human-in-the-loop augmentation and active learning cycles, and maintain engagement with local education stakeholders to iteratively improve the system's cultural fidelity and ethical alignment during trial deployments."

          "feedback_content": "The presented Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines key stages for development and evaluation but lacks detail on how data scarcity and quality issues in underrepresented languages will be addressed, which is a major feasibility concern. Specifically, the plan should include strategies for curating or expanding datasets beyond curricula and dialogue collection to ensure linguistic and cultural richness and sufficient volume for effective fine-tuning and RLHF. Furthermore, the approach to obtaining reliable reinforcement learning signals from human feedback in low-resource settings is not clearly defined; a more detailed annotation and feedback protocol is needed to mitigate potential noise and bias. Clarifying these points would strengthen confidence in the practical viability of the experimental pipeline, especially given major challenges endemic to underrepresented language AI development environments. Consider integrating active learning or human-in-the-loop systems explicitly earlier in the plan and addressing potential infrastructure or user engagement constraints in the deployment phase to improve feasibility robustness and risk management methods for fallback plans beyond rule-based personalization layers as backup solutions for modeling or RLHF failures are advisable to be more concretely specified as well to prevent stagnation during deployment trials with real learners.

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and the broad research lineage in educational AI and multilingual LLM tutoring, the idea's impact and novelty could be notably enhanced by more explicitly integrating concepts from 'human-computer interaction theory' and 'ethical challenges of AI' within diverse educational contexts. For instance, proposing or empirically grounding adaptive interaction strategies based on dialogic and HCI theories tailored specifically for underrepresented language learners could differentiate the approach substantially. Furthermore, proactively addressing ethical implications such as bias, fairness, and cultural sensitivity—not merely as evaluative metrics but through transparent model interpretability or user-centered design—would strengthen both the research rigor and societal impact. Engaging with educational policy makers and researchers of education to co-design culturally grounded curricula and dialogic methods can also expand the project's scope beyond technology towards educational practices and pedagogical skills development,increasing adoption likelihood and relevance in real-world settings. Embedding these globally linked concepts into the methodological core and evaluation metrics will both deepen novelty and amplify transformative impact.
