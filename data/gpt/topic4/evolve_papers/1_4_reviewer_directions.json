    "title": "Cross-Domain Typological Adaptation in Healthcare NLP Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Healthcare NLP tools predominantly developed for English or related languages struggle to generalize to typologically diverse, low-resource languages, limiting equitable access and care.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the external gap by linking typology-aware NLP model development with healthcare application demands, addressing socio-cultural needs via specialized datasets and benchmarks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop adaptation techniques embedding typological features of target languages into domain-adaptive transfer learning frameworks. Construct typology-informed synthetic healthcare dialogues and clinical note datasets in underrepresented languages using controlled data augmentation respecting morphological and syntactic features.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather healthcare NLP datasets in English; 2) Identify key typological challenges in target languages; 3) Generate synthetic data augmenting English datasets with typologically-preserving transformations; 4) Fine-tune multilingual models with synthetic plus limited real data; 5) Evaluate on clinical concept recognition, sentiment, and summarization benchmarks; 6) Compare against non-typology-informed baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical note summarization in Amharic augmented with morphological variation preserving medical term meaning. Expected output: Higher accuracy and factual consistency compared to baseline models ignoring typology.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If synthetic augmentation is insufficient, collaborate with native speakers for small high-quality annotations or incorporate unsupervised pretraining on raw typologically rich corpora."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that embedding typological features directly into domain-adaptive transfer learning frameworks will significantly improve performance on healthcare NLP tasks in low-resource, typologically diverse languages. However, the proposal does not sufficiently justify or cite evidence that such typology-informed embeddings can meaningfully capture complex morphological and syntactic variations in clinical contexts, which often contain domain-specific language and jargon. More clarity is needed on how typological features will be operationalized and integrated without overwhelming the model or introducing noise, especially given the scarcity of real data in these languages. This fundamental assumption is critical to the method's soundness and should be strengthened with preliminary theoretical or empirical support before proceeding further, to ensure the approach stands on solid grounds rather than hopeful intuition or general typological principles alone. This critique targets the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections, where these assumptions are central and insufficiently substantiated in their current form, potentially impairing the research quality and outcomes if unaddressed."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "While the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a logical progression—from dataset gathering, typological challenge identification, synthetic data generation, fine-tuning to evaluation—it lacks detailed feasibility considerations. In particular, generating synthetic healthcare dialogues and clinical notes that preserve nuanced morphological and syntactic typological features is a highly nontrivial task, requiring expert linguistic knowledge and careful validation. The plan also glosses over the capacity to source or create high-quality target language datasets for evaluation, which may be scarce or unavailable. The fallback plan involving native speakers is a sensible backup, but the proposal should explicitly elaborate on resource requirements, annotator recruitment strategy, and timeline implications. Furthermore, the evaluation step should specify metrics and error analyses that directly reflect the benefits of typology-aware adaptation versus standard multilingual baselines. Without more detailed experimental design and risk mitigation, the feasibility of successfully implementing and empirically validating the approach within typical research budgets and timeframes remains questionable. Address these concerns by enriching the Experiment_Plan section with practical resource planning and clear, measurable success criteria."
