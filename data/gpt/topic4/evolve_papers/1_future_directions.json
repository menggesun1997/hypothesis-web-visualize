        "title": "Typology-Infused Prompt Tuning for Low-Resource Languages",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current multilingual large language models (LLMs) inadequately incorporate deep linguistic typological features, especially for typologically distant low-resource languages, limiting their performance and diversity representation.",
        "Motivation": "This project addresses the internal critical gap of insufficient integration of linguistic typology beyond family-based transfer, explicitly targeting non-Indo-European languages with unique morphosyntactic traits.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a Typology-Infused Prompt Tuning (TIPT) framework where typological features (e.g., morphological richness indices, dominant word orders) are encoded into continuous prompts that guide frozen LLMs during fine-tuning on downstream tasks. This modular approach injects typological inductive biases directly into models without requiring full retraining, enhancing adaptability to typologically diverse languages.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect typological feature data from WALS for a diverse set of languages including low-resource ones; 2) Pre-encode these features as continuous prompt vectors; 3) Apply TIPT on pre-trained multilingual models like XLM-R during fine-tuning on sentiment analysis and NER tasks for typologically distant languages; 4) Baselines are vanilla fine-tuning and adapter-based methods; 5) Evaluate with accuracy, F1 scores, and cross-lingual transferability measures; 6) Analyze representation diversity improvements via probing.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentiment classification in a low-resource Niger-Congo language, with the prompt incorporating morphological complexity and SVO order typological vectors. Expected output: Enhanced sentiment prediction accuracy compared to baseline, showing better recognition of morphological variants.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If prompt tuning yields limited gains, incorporate typological features as adapter layers augmenting the transformer architecture, or experiment with multitask learning with typology prediction tasks to reinforce feature integration."

        "title": "Blockchain-Enabled Privacy-Preserving Linguistic Data Marketplace",
        "Problem_Statement": "Linguistic datasets of minority and indigenous languages are scarce due to privacy concerns and lack of secure data governance, impeding the creation of typologically diverse language models.",
        "Motivation": "This addresses the external gap and opportunity in leveraging blockchain and Ethereum smart contracts for secure linguistic data sharing and governance, ensuring rights preservation and incentivizing community contributions.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a decentralized marketplace platform underpinned by Ethereum smart contracts enabling linguists, native speakers, and institutions to share datasets securely with encrypted provenance records. Smart contracts enforce usage policies and facilitate micropayments or tokenized rewards for dataset contributions. Privacy-preserving functionalities such as zero-knowledge proofs protect sensitive content while enabling aggregate learning.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Prototype blockchain-based data registry and access control smart contracts; 2) Integrate standard NLP dataset formats with on-chain metadata; 3) Simulate data sharing, auditing, and reward flows; 4) Test privacy-preserving protocols with synthetic linguistic data; 5) Pilot participation with minority language communities; 6) Measure scalability, cost, security guarantees and uptake.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example: An indigenous language community uploads an annotated corpus with smart contract-enforced restrictions requiring academic usage only. A researcher queries the platform, gains authorized access with data usage logs recorded on-chain, and the community receives micropayments automatically, ensuring transparency and trust.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain scalability or costs become prohibitive, explore hybrid off-chain/on-chain approaches or federated data-sharing frameworks with smart contract mediated audit trails as alternatives."

        "title": "Typology-Guided Multilingual Curriculum Learning",
        "Problem_Statement": "Standard multilingual training treats languages uniformly or clusters them by language family, ignoring fine-grained typological differences that could optimize transfer and reduce negative transfer effects.",
        "Motivation": "Targets internal gaps on typology integration in transfer learning to improve model generalization and bias, moving beyond English-centric and family-based clustering approaches.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a curriculum learning strategy that dynamically organizes training batches based on sliding typological similarity measures, such as word order, morphological complexity, and phonological inventories. The curriculum guides model focus from close typological neighbors to more distant languages progressively, improving robustness and typology-aware representation learning.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Extract typological feature vectors for languages from WALS and URIEL; 2) Define typology distance functions; 3) Construct training curricula reflecting incremental typological divergence; 4) Train multilingual transformers on token-level language modeling and downstream tasks; 5) Compare to random, family-based, and no-curriculum baselines; 6) Evaluate performance, representation diversity, and bias metrics.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Training sequence starts with Spanish, Italian (close to English typology), then progressively includes more distant languages like Basque and Georgian. Expected Output: Improved cross-lingual transfer performance on distant languages, reduced bias on typologically unique constructs.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If curriculum learning yields marginal gains, combine with auxiliary typology prediction tasks or contrastive loss terms emphasizing typological distinctions in representations."

        "title": "Typology-Constrained Embedding Space Regularization",
        "Problem_Statement": "Embeddings in multilingual LLMs often cluster languages by family or script rather than typological features, limiting typology-aware generalization and bias mitigation.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap by explicitly constraining learned embeddings via typological distances, enhancing typology representation diversity beyond traditional family-centric grouping.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a novel embedding regularization loss that penalizes divergence from a typology-derived embedding manifold during training or fine-tuning. Typological distances computed from databases like WALS guide the embedding proximity constraints, encouraging embeddings of typologically similar languages to cluster while preserving meaningful task-specific distances.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compute pairwise typology distances between languages; 2) Implement embedding regularization loss integrated into fine-tuning objective; 3) Fine-tune multilingual LLMs on diverse downstream tasks; 4) Evaluate on typology-diverse benchmarks; 5) Analyze embedding spaces with PCA/t-SNE and measure bias mitigations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multilingual embedding matrix including Turkish and Finnish. Expected outcome: Embeddings reflect typological similarities (e.g., agglutinative morphology) more accurately than mere language family membership, improving downstream task generalization.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If regularization destabilizes training, relax constraints via weighting schedules or combine with multitask objectives predicting typological properties directly."
