        "title": "Culturally Adaptive Multilingual Transformers for Low-Resource Languages",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing multilingual large language models (LLMs) exhibit degraded performance and cultural misalignment when applied to underrepresented and low-resource languages, limiting their real-world applicability and inclusivity.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical internal gap of under-explored multilingual performance on underrepresented languages and the lack of cultural contextualization. By incorporating culture-sensitive adaptive modules, it responds directly to the high-potential innovation opportunity of multilingual pre-trained transformers tailored for underrepresented languages.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular transformer architecture that integrates culture-aware adapter layers dynamically conditioned on culturally encoded embeddings derived from multi-modal knowledge graphs representing norms, expressions, and domain-specific idioms of target low-resource languages. Few-shot fine-tuning is combined with contrastive learning over cultural context pairs to enhance semantic alignment and reduce bias. This approach introduces a two-level linguistic and cultural representation learning pipeline, enabling better generalization and ethical contextuality for target languages.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multilingual corpora enriched with cultural metadata for low-resource languages (e.g., Wolof, Quechua). 2) Construct cultural knowledge graphs using linguistic experts and community inputs. 3) Pre-train the core transformer on multilingual data with culture-augmented adapters. 4) Fine-tune few-shot on downstream tasks (e.g., question answering, summarization). 5) Evaluate with multilingual benchmarks, bias, and fairness metrics adapted for cultural relevance. 6) Compare against baseline multilingual transformers (e.g., mT5, XLM-R).",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A request in Wolof to summarize a community story mentioning culturally significant concepts.\nExpected Output: A summary that accurately preserves cultural references, idiomatic expressions, and contextual meaning, avoiding literal mistranslations or culturally insensitive interpretations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If cultural adapter layers do not improve performance, revert to a knowledge distillation approach from larger multilingual models supplemented with retrieved cultural snippets during inference. Additionally, perform error analysis to refine cultural knowledge graph representations and extend community-driven data annotation for better contextual grounding."

        "title": "Cross-Modal Knowledge Graph Integration for Enhancing Underrepresented Language LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Transformer-based LLMs do not effectively incorporate structured extralinguistic knowledge, especially for underrepresented languages lacking rich textual data, leading to shallow understanding and limited performance.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the external gap of overlooked opportunities to leverage knowledge graphs to enrich low-resource language contexts, transforming the representation learning with a novel cross-modal approach connecting symbolic knowledge to textual embeddings.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a hybrid LLM framework that fuses transformer embeddings with dynamically retrieved and encoded subgraphs from multilingual knowledge graphs aligned to the input text in underrepresented languages. The model integrates a graph encoder module that conditions token representations on relevant graph embeddings via cross-attention. This enables grounding in factual, cultural, and domain knowledge inherently missing from sparse textual corpora, enhancing downstream tasks' accuracy and relevance.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build and link multilingual knowledge graphs containing entities and relations focused on underrepresented languages. 2) Implement graph encoder modules compatible with transformer layers. 3) Train end-to-end on tasks such as entity linking, fact verification, and named entity recognition in low-resource languages. 4) Evaluate improvements against standard transformer-only baselines and knowledge graph-agnostic methods. 5) Use metrics like F1, accuracy, and knowledge consistency measures.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A news snippet in Haitian Creole mentioning a local leader.\nExpected Output: Correct identification and contextualization of the leader with enriched factual grounding from the knowledge graph, resulting in factual consistency in summarization or question answering.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If joint end-to-end training proves unstable, adopt a two-stage pipeline separating knowledge retrieval and encoding from language modeling. Alternatively, explore precomputing graph embeddings and integrating them via lightweight fusion techniques."

        "title": "Few-Shot Multilingual Program Synthesis for Underrepresented Languages",
        "Problem_Statement": "Few-shot learning approaches for program synthesis predominantly target high-resource languages, leaving underrepresented programming dialects and language-integrated tasks underserved, limiting automation and accessibility.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses internal gap on lack of few-shot effectiveness for underrepresented languages and expands the synthesis frontier by integrating linguistically diverse code and natural language inputs for programming-related tasks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a bilingual code-natural language synthesis model that learns to generate code snippets from natural language prompts in underrepresented language contexts with few-shot examples. It uses a dual encoder transformer capturing semantic bridging between low-resource human languages and domain-specific code structures, enhanced by meta-learning strategies to adapt quickly to new language-programming pairs with scarce data.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect small aligned datasets of programming problems and natural language descriptions in underrepresented languages (e.g., Amharic, Malagasy). 2) Pre-train with existing high-resource language data, then meta-train on low-resource pairs. 3) Fine-tune few-shot on selected programming tasks (e.g., data manipulation, arithmetic functions). 4) Evaluate code correctness, semantic accuracy, and adaptability via metrics like BLEU, exact match, and execution accuracy. 5) Benchmark against monolingual and multilingual baselines without meta-learning.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Natural language instruction in Amharic \"አሁን ሰአት እንዴት እንደሚታይ ኮድ ጻፍ\" (Write code to display current time).\nExpected Output: Correct, executable code snippet that outputs current time, adapted to syntax norms and language conventions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If few-shot adaptation is insufficient, incorporate retrieval-augmented generation leveraging external code examples and documentation. Perform error analysis to improve meta-learning curriculum and augment data via synthetic generation from high-resource proxies."

        "title": "Personalized Educational Chatbots in Underrepresented Languages Using Multilingual LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Personalized tutoring systems largely ignore learners who speak underrepresented languages, perpetuating educational inequities amplified by lack of adaptive, culturally contextualized AI-driven content tutoring in those languages.",
        "Motivation": "Capitalizes on the external gap and high-potential integration opportunity of combining personalized learning systems with multilingual generative AI for underrepresented language learners, emphasizing immersive and culturally relevant interactions.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create an adaptive conversational AI tutoring platform that leverages multilingual LLMs fine-tuned with culturally and linguistically contextualized educational content. The system incorporates user modeling based on engagement, proficiency, and cultural background to tailor dialogue, explanations, and activities dynamically, enabled by reinforcement learning from human feedback focused on educational outcomes and cultural appropriateness.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather educational curricula and dialogue datasets in target underrepresented languages. 2) Fine-tune multilingual LLMs on domain-specific pedagogical content. 3) Develop user profiling modules integrating cultural and linguistic features. 4) Deploy dialogue systems tested with real learners; collect feedback for RLHF tuning. 5) Evaluate effectiveness via learning outcome metrics, user satisfaction surveys, and fairness/ bias measurements.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A learner interacts with the chatbot in Igbo asking for help understanding a mathematical concept.\nExpected Output: The chatbot responds with an explanation suitable for the learner’s proficiency and cultural context, using relatable examples and interactive questions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If user modeling or RLHF proves challenging, implement rule-based fallback personalization layers. Increase dataset diversity with human-in-the-loop annotation to improve dialogue quality and cultural fidelity."

        "title": "Ethical Fairness Benchmarking Suite for Multilingual LLMs Focused on Underrepresented Languages",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing evaluation benchmarks for fairness and bias in LLMs are predominantly English- or high-resource-language centric, lacking metrics and datasets reflecting ethical, cultural, and linguistic nuances of underrepresented languages.",
        "Motivation": "Directly tackles a critical internal gap and leverages the high-potential opportunity to develop ethical and bias-aware evaluation metrics and benchmarks, enabling transparent, culturally sensitive model assessment globally.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design and release a comprehensive benchmark suite integrating multilingual datasets, ethical scenario descriptions, and culturally informed fairness metrics tailored to low-resource languages. The benchmark combines simulation of social bias scenarios, cultural norm compliance tests, and linguistic fairness probes, accompanied by explainability tools to diagnose model decisions across languages and contexts.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate multilingual corpus with sensitive topics and ethical edge cases from diverse underrepresented language communities. 2) Work with linguists and ethicists to define fairness metrics beyond standard statistical measures, incorporating cultural value alignment. 3) Develop automated and human evaluation protocols. 4) Benchmark popular multilingual LLMs and analyze fairness gaps. 5) Publish benchmark with open leaderboard and documentation for community engagement.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A multilingual model generates responses to a user query about gender roles in a low-resource language.\nExpected Output: Responses that avoid stereotyping, demonstrate cultural awareness, and maintain the user's dignity, measured by the benchmark's fairness metrics.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If gathering ethical data proves slow or sensitive, start with proxy languages and crowdsourced annotations to establish methodology. Iteratively refine metrics and expand language coverage based on community feedback."
