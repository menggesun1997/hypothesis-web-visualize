    "title": "Personalized Educational Chatbots in Underrepresented Languages Using Multilingual LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Personalized tutoring systems largely ignore learners who speak underrepresented languages, perpetuating educational inequities amplified by lack of adaptive, culturally contextualized AI-driven content tutoring in those languages.",
    "Motivation": "Capitalizes on the external gap and high-potential integration opportunity of combining personalized learning systems with multilingual generative AI for underrepresented language learners, emphasizing immersive and culturally relevant interactions.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an adaptive conversational AI tutoring platform that leverages multilingual LLMs fine-tuned with culturally and linguistically contextualized educational content. The system incorporates user modeling based on engagement, proficiency, and cultural background to tailor dialogue, explanations, and activities dynamically, enabled by reinforcement learning from human feedback focused on educational outcomes and cultural appropriateness.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather educational curricula and dialogue datasets in target underrepresented languages. 2) Fine-tune multilingual LLMs on domain-specific pedagogical content. 3) Develop user profiling modules integrating cultural and linguistic features. 4) Deploy dialogue systems tested with real learners; collect feedback for RLHF tuning. 5) Evaluate effectiveness via learning outcome metrics, user satisfaction surveys, and fairness/ bias measurements.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A learner interacts with the chatbot in Igbo asking for help understanding a mathematical concept.\nExpected Output: The chatbot responds with an explanation suitable for the learner’s proficiency and cultural context, using relatable examples and interactive questions.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If user modeling or RLHF proves challenging, implement rule-based fallback personalization layers. Increase dataset diversity with human-in-the-loop annotation to improve dialogue quality and cultural fidelity."

          "feedback_content": "The presented Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines key stages for development and evaluation but lacks detail on how data scarcity and quality issues in underrepresented languages will be addressed, which is a major feasibility concern. Specifically, the plan should include strategies for curating or expanding datasets beyond curricula and dialogue collection to ensure linguistic and cultural richness and sufficient volume for effective fine-tuning and RLHF. Furthermore, the approach to obtaining reliable reinforcement learning signals from human feedback in low-resource settings is not clearly defined; a more detailed annotation and feedback protocol is needed to mitigate potential noise and bias. Clarifying these points would strengthen confidence in the practical viability of the experimental pipeline, especially given major challenges endemic to underrepresented language AI development environments. Consider integrating active learning or human-in-the-loop systems explicitly earlier in the plan and addressing potential infrastructure or user engagement constraints in the deployment phase to improve feasibility robustness and risk management methods for fallback plans beyond rule-based personalization layers as backup solutions for modeling or RLHF failures are advisable to be more concretely specified as well to prevent stagnation during deployment trials with real learners.

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and the broad research lineage in educational AI and multilingual LLM tutoring, the idea's impact and novelty could be notably enhanced by more explicitly integrating concepts from 'human-computer interaction theory' and 'ethical challenges of AI' within diverse educational contexts. For instance, proposing or empirically grounding adaptive interaction strategies based on dialogic and HCI theories tailored specifically for underrepresented language learners could differentiate the approach substantially. Furthermore, proactively addressing ethical implications such as bias, fairness, and cultural sensitivity—not merely as evaluative metrics but through transparent model interpretability or user-centered design—would strengthen both the research rigor and societal impact. Engaging with educational policy makers and researchers of education to co-design culturally grounded curricula and dialogic methods can also expand the project's scope beyond technology towards educational practices and pedagogical skills development,increasing adoption likelihood and relevance in real-world settings. Embedding these globally linked concepts into the methodological core and evaluation metrics will both deepen novelty and amplify transformative impact.
