    "title": "Integrated Moral Normativity Loss Function for Multilingual Bias Mitigation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing training pipelines lack an intrinsic, operational loss function that directly encodes moral normativity during multilingual LLM fine-tuning to prevent toxic or biased outputs effectively.",
    "Motivation": "Directly confronts the internal gap relating to operationalizing moral normativity within training by proposing a novel loss function informed by interdisciplinary ethical models to guide fair language representation learning during fine-tuning.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design and integrate into LLM training a differentiable moral normativity loss based on probabilistic ethical evaluations from psychological and health science theories. The loss penalizes model-generated texts divergent from fairness and ethical norms dynamically across languages, guiding the model toward equitable and safe outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Formalize moral normativity criteria from cross-disciplinary frameworks into computable metrics. 2) Implement the normativity loss function combining with language modeling objectives. 3) Fine-tune multilingual LLMs on diverse datasets with and without the loss. 4) Evaluate outputs for toxicity reduction, fairness across languages, and preservation of language fluency. 5) Conduct ablation studies of loss components.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Discuss social stereotypes about ethnicity.\" Output: Outputs tempered by the normativity loss function to avoid biased or toxic statements, reflecting moral constraints consistent across languages.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If the normativity loss impairs model fluency, try multi-objective optimization balancing normativity and language modeling losses. Alternatively, explore curriculum learning introducing the loss progressively."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines the integration of a differentiable moral normativity loss into multilingual LLM training based on probabilistic ethical evaluations. However, the mechanism by which such interdisciplinary ethical theories from psychology and health sciences translate into precise, differentiable loss metrics is under-specified. Clarify the concrete computational formulation of these ethical constraints and how they are validated to reliably capture moral normativity without inducing unintended behavioral biases or overly constraining language generation. Detailing the theoretical and technical steps to bridge ethical theory to differentiable loss will significantly strengthen soundness and reproducibility of the method, especially across diverse languages and cultures where moral norms vary subtly but importantly. Providing example formulations or preliminary experiments on formalizing these criteria would be highly beneficial for assessing feasibility and validity of the core approach in Proposed_Method."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict of NOV-COMPETITIVE, the idea can benefit from deeper integration with globally-relevant legal and ethical frameworks. I suggest exploring a fusion of this moral normativity loss with principles from 'international human rights law' or 'legal theory of interpretation' to provide a well-founded normative backbone that can guide fair multilingual model behavior respecting universal rights and local sociocultural legal norms. Additionally, incorporating concepts from 'AI assistance' and 'communicating agents' to align the LLM's outputs with interactive ethical standards or legal compliance could broaden impact. This direction can move the work beyond purely empirical fairness metrics toward principled, cross-disciplinary AI ethics integration, elevating novelty and the scope of impact across AI applications in law, human-robot interaction, and multilingual communication."
