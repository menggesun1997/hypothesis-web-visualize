    "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Ethical Normativity Framework for Multicultural Conversational Agents",
    "Problem_Statement": "Multilingual conversational agents inadequately encode context-sensitive moral reasoning, leading to outputs that lack fairness and cultural appropriateness across diverse populations.",
    "Motivation": "Tackles the internal gap in integrating moral normativity assessments directly into model training and the external gap of importing frameworks from health sciences and psychology, aligning closely with the second high-potential innovation opportunity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a training framework that incorporates iterative human-in-the-loop feedback from ethicists and sociocultural experts using a structured ethical decision-making interface inspired by nursing education paradigms. The model learns to weigh context-dependent fairness factors dynamically, adapting conversational responses to diverse cultural and linguistic contexts with integrated psychological ethical frameworks.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate a multilingual conversational dataset enriched with ethical and fairness annotations from varied cultures. 2) Develop an interactive interface for expert ethics feedback. 3) Fine-tune multilingual conversational LLMs via reinforcement learning guided by human ethical ratings. 4) Evaluate improvements in fairness, moral reasoning, and user satisfaction across different language user groups using qualitative and quantitative metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Tell me about social roles in community life.\" Output: Culturally sensitive, unbiased responses reflecting ethical norms relevant to the user's language and culture, e.g., avoiding stereotypes or marginalizing narratives.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If expert-in-the-loop data collection is slow, deploy simulated ethical evaluators trained on health science ethical frameworks. Alternatively, incorporate user feedback loops for continual model refinement after deployment."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-MECHANISM",
          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a high-level idea of integrating a human-in-the-loop framework with ethicists and sociocultural experts, inspired by nursing education paradigms. However, it lacks clarity and specificity on how exactly the ethical decision-making interface will operationalize context-dependent fairness factors into model training. Concrete mechanisms, such as the format of ethical annotations, the feedback loop structure, reward modeling in reinforcement learning, and how psychological ethical frameworks are encoded, remain vague. To enhance soundness, the proposal should elaborate on the technical design of the human-in-the-loop interface and the exact training procedure, ensuring the mechanism is practically implementable and theoretically grounded in AI and ethical reasoning principles, beyond metaphorical inspiration from nursing models. This will strengthen confidence in the methodology's ability to achieve nuanced moral normativity integration in diverse multilingual conversational agents reliably and scalably, rather than remain a conceptual sketch. Without this clarity, the approach risks being underspecified and challenging to reproduce or evaluate rigorously at later stages of research development and peer review, thereby weakening the core technical contribution of the work. Thus, a more detailed, stepwise description of the methodological mechanism is critical before proceeding further to experimentation or deployment phases."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screening rating of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the global concepts related to linguistic, social, and educational dimensions, the research idea can significantly increase its impact and originality by systematically integrating insights from 'language policy' and 'practices of judgment,' especially linking legal and ethical adjudication concepts to the conversational agents' moral reasoning. For instance, the model could incorporate normativity frameworks derived from 'legal theory' and 'socially interactive agents' to simulate multi-layered ethical decision-making, reflecting not only cultural norms but also formalized regulatory or policy constraints across languages. This would broaden the scope from ethical norms to include authoritative societal rules, enriching the fairness considerations. Additionally, leveraging 'language education' and 'critical youth studies' could allow tailoring agent responses sensitive to identity themes and social realities experienced by youth demographics, further grounding the ethical framework in contemporary, socially relevant contexts. Embedding these globally-linked themes could boost the framework's novelty and impact by combining cutting-edge AI approaches with interdisciplinary social sciences and humanities perspectives, aligning well with ACL or NeurIPS conferences' emphasis on socially aware, interpretable AI systems."
