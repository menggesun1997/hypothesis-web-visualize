    "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Ethical Normativity Framework for Multicultural Conversational Agents",
    "Problem_Statement": "Multilingual conversational agents inadequately encode context-sensitive moral reasoning, leading to outputs that lack fairness and cultural appropriateness across diverse populations.",
    "Motivation": "Tackles the internal gap in integrating moral normativity assessments directly into model training and the external gap of importing frameworks from health sciences and psychology, aligning closely with the second high-potential innovation opportunity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a training framework that incorporates iterative human-in-the-loop feedback from ethicists and sociocultural experts using a structured ethical decision-making interface inspired by nursing education paradigms. The model learns to weigh context-dependent fairness factors dynamically, adapting conversational responses to diverse cultural and linguistic contexts with integrated psychological ethical frameworks.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate a multilingual conversational dataset enriched with ethical and fairness annotations from varied cultures. 2) Develop an interactive interface for expert ethics feedback. 3) Fine-tune multilingual conversational LLMs via reinforcement learning guided by human ethical ratings. 4) Evaluate improvements in fairness, moral reasoning, and user satisfaction across different language user groups using qualitative and quantitative metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Tell me about social roles in community life.\" Output: Culturally sensitive, unbiased responses reflecting ethical norms relevant to the user's language and culture, e.g., avoiding stereotypes or marginalizing narratives.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If expert-in-the-loop data collection is slow, deploy simulated ethical evaluators trained on health science ethical frameworks. Alternatively, incorporate user feedback loops for continual model refinement after deployment."

        "title": "Multi-Layered Human-in-the-Loop Ethical Normativity Framework for Context-Aware Multicultural Conversational Agents Integrating Legal, Sociocultural, and Youth-Centric Norms",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing multilingual conversational agents lack robust integration of nuanced, context-sensitive moral reasoning, resulting in outputs that can compromise fairness, cultural appropriateness, and regulatory compliance across diverse populations and language communities. They insufficiently capture layered normativity encompassing cultural ethics, legal constraints, and youthful identity dynamics, leading to socially insensitive or legally non-compliant interactions.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work has explored incorporating ethical feedback into conversational AI, such efforts often remain underspecified in mechanism and scope, limiting reproducibility, scalability, and impact. This research addresses critical internal gaps by concretely operationalizing an iterative, human-in-the-loop training methodology grounded in detailed ethical and legal norm representations, reinforced by state-of-the-art reinforcement learning paradigms and informed by interdisciplinary theories from legal adjudication, language policy, and youth cultural studies. By embedding frameworks from social sciences and humanities—such as legal theory, practices of judgment, and critical youth studies—within multilingual conversational agents, the framework aims to advance beyond prior art, delivering socially aware, interpretable, and normatively layered conversation capabilities attuned to diverse cultural and educational contexts. This strategy aligns strongly with cutting-edge challenges highlighted by ACL and NeurIPS, emphasizing rigorous, socially grounded AI capable of nuanced moral reasoning and regulatory conformity in diverse global contexts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a concretely specified, multi-layered human-in-the-loop training framework integrating ethical, legal, and sociocultural normativity into multilingual conversational LLMs, operationalized as follows:\n\n1) **Ethical and Legal Annotation Schema:** Develop a structured annotation protocol capturing multilayer normativity including (a) cultural fairness and ethical considerations per language community; (b) formalized legal and policy constraints derived from 'legal theory' and 'language policy' documents pertinent to target jurisdictions; and (c) identity-sensitive sociocultural norms inspired by 'critical youth studies' and 'language education' literature capturing youth and marginalized group social realities.\n\n2) **Expert Feedback Interface:** Design a modular, web-based interface allowing human experts (ethicists, legal scholars, sociolinguists, youth culture experts) to review and annotate conversational outputs with detailed categorical feedback: normative violations, context mismatches, fairness metrics, and identity sensitivity flags. The interface supports layered feedback, linking normative judgments explicitly to framework categories, and capturing reasoning rationales to enhance transparency.\n\n3) **Reinforcement Learning with Layered Reward Modeling:** Construct a multi-objective reward model integrating expert feedback signals weighted per norm category (ethical, legal, sociocultural). The rewards are operationalized in a reinforcement learning framework fine-tuning the LLM’s response generation dynamically to optimize adherence to layered normative criteria. Crucially, the model is trained to detect and adapt to linguistic and cultural context cues leveraging learned embeddings of sociocultural constructs.\n\n4) **Norm Embedding and Dynamic Context Encoding:** Integrate normativity embeddings derived from language policy documents and youth culture corpora as additional context inputs to the model, enabling nuanced multi-dimensional norm reasoning during inference.\n\n5) **Evaluation and Iteration:** Employ quantitative fairness metrics, legal compliance checklists, and qualitative user studies across multilingual user groups including youth demographics to iteratively refine reward weights and annotation schema.\n\nThis modular methodology transforms metaphorical inspirations from nursing education paradigms into mechanistically precise, replicable AI-human collaborative loops explicitly grounded in interdisciplinary normative theory and practical AI training techniques.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate multilingual conversational datasets enriched with layered annotations: ethical fairness (e.g., bias, stereotyping), legal norms (e.g., speech regulation, data privacy), and youth identity sensitivities (e.g., inclusive language, social justice themes).\n2) Develop and pilot the expert feedback interface with interdisciplinary panels including legal theorists, cultural ethicists, and youth culture scholars to establish annotation consistency and resolve norm conflicts.\n3) Construct the multi-objective reward model reflecting weighted expert feedback categories; pre-train with simulated ethical evaluators to bootstrap.\n4) Fine-tune multilingual conversational LLMs with reinforcement learning guided by the layered reward signals incorporating norm embeddings.\n5) Conduct rigorous quantitative evaluation using standardized fairness benchmarks, legal compliance tests, and newly designed youth cultural sensitivity metrics.\n6) Perform extensive user studies across linguistically and culturally diverse cohorts, focusing on youth populations to assess the social relevance and acceptability of ethical norm integration.\n7) Analyze failure cases to iteratively refine annotation schemas, the reward model, and expert interface, ensuring practical scalability and interpretability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Tell me about social roles in community life.\"\nOutput: Culturally informed, legally compliant, and youth-sensitive response, e.g., avoiding gender stereotyping common in some cultures, respecting local community legal frameworks on speech, and using inclusive language that acknowledges youth identity perspectives.\n\nInput: \"What do you think about protests during political unrest?\"\nOutput: Balanced socially-aware answer that reflects regional legal rights and restrictions pertaining to assembly, interprets ethical principles of fairness and justice, and is sensitive to youth activism narratives and identity formations informed by critical youth studies.\n\nInput: \"Explain family roles in different cultures.\"\nOutput: Response avoids marginalization or perpetuation of social hierarchies, integrates culturally specific social norms verified by ethicists, respects relevant legal definitions of family structures, and accommodates diverse youth family identities.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time expert-in-the-loop annotation proves a bottleneck, we will deploy a multi-agent simulated ethical evaluator ensemble trained on comprehensive corpora from health sciences ethical guidelines, international legal documents, and sociocultural narratives to generate proxy feedback. Additionally, integrate continuous user feedback crowdsourcing emphasizing youth and socioculturally diverse populations post-deployment to incrementally refine model norm adherence. These fallback strategies ensure scalable model improvements while maintaining layered normative rigour and practical deployment feasibility."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a high-level idea of integrating a human-in-the-loop framework with ethicists and sociocultural experts, inspired by nursing education paradigms. However, it lacks clarity and specificity on how exactly the ethical decision-making interface will operationalize context-dependent fairness factors into model training. Concrete mechanisms, such as the format of ethical annotations, the feedback loop structure, reward modeling in reinforcement learning, and how psychological ethical frameworks are encoded, remain vague. To enhance soundness, the proposal should elaborate on the technical design of the human-in-the-loop interface and the exact training procedure, ensuring the mechanism is practically implementable and theoretically grounded in AI and ethical reasoning principles, beyond metaphorical inspiration from nursing models. This will strengthen confidence in the methodology's ability to achieve nuanced moral normativity integration in diverse multilingual conversational agents reliably and scalably, rather than remain a conceptual sketch. Without this clarity, the approach risks being underspecified and challenging to reproduce or evaluate rigorously at later stages of research development and peer review, thereby weakening the core technical contribution of the work. Thus, a more detailed, stepwise description of the methodological mechanism is critical before proceeding further to experimentation or deployment phases."

          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screening rating of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the global concepts related to linguistic, social, and educational dimensions, the research idea can significantly increase its impact and originality by systematically integrating insights from 'language policy' and 'practices of judgment,' especially linking legal and ethical adjudication concepts to the conversational agents' moral reasoning. For instance, the model could incorporate normativity frameworks derived from 'legal theory' and 'socially interactive agents' to simulate multi-layered ethical decision-making, reflecting not only cultural norms but also formalized regulatory or policy constraints across languages. This would broaden the scope from ethical norms to include authoritative societal rules, enriching the fairness considerations. Additionally, leveraging 'language education' and 'critical youth studies' could allow tailoring agent responses sensitive to identity themes and social realities experienced by youth demographics, further grounding the ethical framework in contemporary, socially relevant contexts. Embedding these globally-linked themes could boost the framework's novelty and impact by combining cutting-edge AI approaches with interdisciplinary social sciences and humanities perspectives, aligning well with ACL or NeurIPS conferences' emphasis on socially aware, interpretable AI systems."
