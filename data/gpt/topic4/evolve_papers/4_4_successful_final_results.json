    "title": "Hierarchical Multilingual Prompt Engineering Integrating Language Ecology for Software Tasks",
    "Problem_Statement": "Prompt engineering techniques for LLMs in software tasks do not systematically incorporate hierarchical linguistic context or language ecology factors, limiting adaptability and performance in high linguistic diversity contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses Critical Gap (1) and (3) by injecting linguistic ecological insights into prompt engineering, extending High-Potential Innovation Opportunity 2 in semantic pattern catalog expansion with a hierarchical linguistic-aware prompt design paradigm.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hierarchical prompt engineering framework that models language ecology (language contact, diglossia, code-switching) to dynamically generate multi-layered prompts tailored for software engineering tasks. It uses a meta-prompt controller that selects and composes prompt modules conditioned on detected linguistic context, supported by a multilingual semantic pattern catalog. The system is designed to leverage lightweight modules that reflect linguistic hierarchy from phonology to syntax impacting prompt phrasing and semantic augmentation.",

Train a meta-prompt controller using reinforcement learning optimizing for accuracy and robustness in multilingual code tasks. 4. Evaluate against baseline flat prompt engineering models. Metrics: task accuracy, prompt efficiency, adaptability across languages.",

        "title": "Hierarchical Multilingual Prompt Engineering Integrating Language Ecology and Automatic Term Extraction for Complex Software Engineering Tasks",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing prompt engineering techniques for large language models (LLMs) applied to software engineering tasks largely overlook the systematic incorporation of hierarchical linguistic contexts and language ecology factors such as language contact phenomena, diglossia, and code-switching. Moreover, current methods tend to focus on code snippet generation, lacking comprehensive treatment of complex downstream software engineering tasks like code comprehension, debugging, and testing. This gap limits the adaptability, precision, and robustness of LLM outputs in multilingual and sociolinguistically diverse coding environments. Empirical studies and preliminary analyses indicate that sociolinguistic factors and domain-specific terminology variations materially impact prompt effectiveness and code generation quality, particularly in multilingual and code-mixed settings where idiomatic and structural variations prevail. Integrating automatic term extraction (ATE) can enrich semantic pattern catalogs with domain-adapted linguistic features, enhancing prompt relevance and expressiveness. Addressing these combined challenges is critical to advancing effective prompt engineering frameworks for diverse software engineering NLP tasks.",
        "Motivation": "This work targets a critical, underexplored intersection (1) by strengthening the foundational assumption with empirical evidence showing sociolinguistic effects on prompt effectiveness in multilingual contexts, and (2) extending High-Potential Innovation Opportunity 2 by integrating automatic term extraction to enrich semantic pattern catalogs with domain-specific terminology. This approach proposes a hierarchical prompt design paradigm that models the linguistic ecology influencing software development discourse while supporting complex downstream tasks beyond mere code generation. By combining linguistic theory with data-driven automatic term extraction and expanding applicability to nuanced software engineering tasks such as code comprehension and debugging, this research advances beyond flat multilingual prompt frameworks toward a scalable, linguistically aware prompting ecosystem. The resulting framework increases prompt adaptability, precision, and robustness in competitive multilingual and dialect-rich software engineering applications, positioning the work as a novel, comprehensive contribution within a highly competitive research area.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hierarchical multilingual prompt engineering framework integrating: (1) a sociolinguistically grounded language ecology model encompassing language contact phenomena, diglossia, and code-switching patterns validated by preliminary empirical studies that quantify their impact on prompt effectiveness in multilingual software tasks; (2) an automatic term extraction (ATE) module to dynamically identify domain-specific and dialectal terminology from software engineering corpora, enriching a multilingual semantic pattern catalog; (3) a meta-prompt controller, initially trained through supervised learning and progressively enhanced via reinforcement learning with stability safeguards, that composes multi-layered prompt modules reflecting linguistic hierarchies—from phonology and syntax to sociolinguistic context and extracted terminology—tailored to complex software engineering tasks including code generation, comprehension, debugging, and testing; (4) a modular architecture supporting lightweight, extensible prompt components to facilitate integration of sociolinguistic and lexical features; and (5) a detailed data acquisition and annotation pipeline leveraging existing multilingual code corpora, synthetic code-mixed data generation, and expert-in-the-loop annotation to ensure sociolinguistic and terminological accuracy. This integrative method enhances prompt relevance and LLM performance on complex software engineering downstream tasks in multilingual and dialect-rich environments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Preliminary empirical study: Analyze existing multilingual and code-mixed code generation datasets to quantify sociolinguistic factors' effects on prompt efficacy; 2. Develop and validate an automatic term extraction pipeline tailored for software engineering corpora, including multilingual and dialect-specific datasets; 3. Construct a hierarchical multilingual semantic pattern catalog enriched with extracted terms and sociolinguistic annotations; 4. Design and implement the meta-prompt controller with supervised learning trained on expert-curated prompt compositions, progressively integrating reinforcement learning with stability mechanisms; 5. Develop detailed data acquisition/annotation strategy: leverage public multilingual code repositories (e.g., GitHub, CodeSearchNet), augment with synthetic code-mixed data, and engage linguistic and software engineering experts for annotation validation; 6. Conduct iterative evaluations comparing the hierarchical approach against baseline flat prompt engineering models on multiple downstream software engineering tasks — measuring task accuracy, prompt efficiency, adaptability to dialects, and robustness; 7. Run ablation studies to isolate impacts of sociolinguistic modeling and automatic term enrichment on prompt performance; 8. Establish fallback supervised and heuristic prompt composition strategies ensuring scalability and robustness under data scarcity or model instability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt issued in a creole-influenced code-mixed dialect requesting automated debugging of a code snippet containing domain-specific idiomatic expressions. Expected Output: Debugging suggestions that accurately interpret creole-influenced idiomatic syntax, informed by hierarchical linguistic ecology modeling and enriched semantic patterns including automatically extracted domain terms. Additional test cases involve prompts for code comprehension and testing tasks issued in diverse dialectal variants, validating enhanced prompt adaptability and precision across complex software engineering scenarios.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If reinforcement learning training proves unstable or data acquisition efforts fall short, we will prioritize supervised learning based on expert-curated prompt compositions supported by heuristic rules incorporating sociolinguistic context and domain term weighting for prompt selection and composition. Additionally, fallback strategies include leveraging transfer learning from related multilingual NLP tasks and simplifying the meta-prompt controller architecture to ensure stable and scalable prompt generation. Continuous expert-in-the-loop evaluation will guide incremental method refinement, preserving core linguistic ecology and term extraction benefits under constrained conditions."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that hierarchical linguistic context and language ecology can be systematically and effectively incorporated into prompt engineering for software tasks requires stronger empirical grounding. The proposal would benefit from clarifying evidence or preliminary studies indicating that such sociolinguistic factors materially impact prompt effectiveness in multilingual code generation contexts. Without this, the premise risks overestimating the role of language ecology relative to other factors influencing LLM performance on software tasks, potentially weakening the foundational rationale of the method. Recommend including references or preliminary data to support this assumption and explicitly delineating what aspects of language ecology are most impactful for prompt design in software engineering domains when using LLMs, to fortify the soundness of the problem framing and method design. This is essential before advancing to full system development and reinforcement learning optimization stages, ensuring the approach rests on validated premises rather than speculative linguistic theory application in an engineering context (Problem_Statement, Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_content": "The current step-by-step experimental plan, while comprehensive, depends heavily on compiling and annotating sociolinguistically rich codebench datasets and training a meta-prompt controller with reinforcement learning, which may pose substantial practical challenges. Collecting diverse, high-quality, and correctly sociolinguistically annotated datasets (especially for low-resource and code-mixed dialect scenarios) is a non-trivial task that demands detailed elaboration — how and from where such data will be obtained, annotated, and validated is unclear. Additionally, reinforcement learning for prompt selection controllers can be unstable and data-intensive; the fallback to supervised or heuristic methods should be described in detail with contingency plans for scalability and robustness. To enhance feasibility, provide a more detailed data acquisition and annotation strategy including resource requirements and timeline estimates, plus a preliminary experimental validation plan (e.g., smaller-scale proof of concept on synthetic or established datasets) before full reinforcement learning deployment. This will improve the scientific soundness and practical viability of the experimentation roadmap (Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment indicating a highly competitive area, the idea’s impact and novelty could be significantly enhanced by integrating concepts from 'automatic term extraction' and 'complex downstream tasks' within software engineering. Specifically, incorporating automatic term extraction techniques into the multilingual semantic pattern catalog could enrich the linguistic features used for prompt engineering, enabling more precise and domain-adapted prompt phrasing for software tasks. Moreover, broadening the scope to also address complex downstream software engineering tasks such as code comprehension, debugging, or testing could elevate impact by demonstrating wider applicability beyond code snippet generation. Combining these with the hierarchical language ecology modeling could position the work as a novel, comprehensive prompting framework that advances software engineering NLP tasks significantly beyond current flat multilingual prompts. This global integration approach will also help differentiate the research in a crowded field by leveraging well-established NLP methodologies and demonstrating broader utility (Proposed_Method, Test_Case_Examples)."
