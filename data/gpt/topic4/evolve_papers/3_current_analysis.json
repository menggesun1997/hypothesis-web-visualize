They possess deep language comprehension, human-like text generation capabilities, contextual awareness, and robust problem-solving skills, making them invaluable in various domains (e.g., search engines, customer support, translation). In the meantime, LLMs have also gained traction in the security community, revealing security vulnerabilities and showcasing their potential in security-related tasks. This paper explores the intersection of LLMs with security and privacy. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs positively impact security and privacy, potential risks and threats associated with their use, and inherent vulnerabilities within LLMs. Through a comprehensive literature review, the paper categorizes the papers into “The Good” (beneficial LLM applications), “The Bad” (offensive applications), and “The Ugly” (vulnerabilities of LLMs and their defenses). We have some interesting findings. For example, LLMs have proven to enhance code security (code vulnerability detection) and data privacy (data confidentiality protection), outperforming traditional methods. However, they can also be harnessed for various attacks (particularly user-level attacks) due to their human-like reasoning abilities. We have identified areas that require further research efforts. For example, Research on model and parameter extraction attacks is limited and often theoretical, hindered by LLM parameter scale and confidentiality. Safe instruction tuning, a recent development, requires more exploration. We hope that our work can shed light on the LLMs’ potential to both bolster and jeopardize cybersecurity.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'AnomalyGPT: Detecting Industrial Anomalies Using Large Vision-Language Models', 'abstract': 'Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) such as MiniGPT-4 and LLaVA have demonstrated the capability of understanding images and achieved remarkable performance in various visual tasks. Despite their strong abilities in recognizing common objects due to extensive training datasets, they lack specific domain knowledge and have a weaker understanding of localized details within objects, which hinders their effectiveness in the Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) task. On the other hand, most existing IAD methods only provide anomaly scores and necessitate the manual setting of thresholds to distinguish between normal and abnormal samples, which restricts their practical implementation. In this paper, we explore the utilization of LVLM to address the IAD problem and propose AnomalyGPT, a novel IAD approach based on LVLM. We generate training data by simulating anomalous images and producing corresponding textual descriptions for each image. We also employ an image decoder to provide fine-grained semantic and design a prompt learner to fine-tune the LVLM using prompt embeddings. Our AnomalyGPT eliminates the need for manual threshold adjustments, thus directly assesses the presence and locations of anomalies. Additionally, AnomalyGPT supports multi-turn dialogues and exhibits impressive few-shot in-context learning capabilities. With only one normal shot, AnomalyGPT achieves the state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 86.1%, an image-level AUC of 94.1%, and a pixel-level AUC of 95.3% on the MVTec-AD dataset.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Learning Semantic Context from Normal Samples for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection', 'abstract': 'Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to identify data samples that have low probability density from a set of input samples, and only the normal samples are provided for model training. The inference of abnormal regions on the input image requires an understanding of the surrounding semantic context. This work presents a Semantic Context based Anomaly Detection Network, SCADN, for unsupervised anomaly detection by learning the semantic context from the normal samples. To achieve this, we first generate multi-scale striped masks to remove a part of regions from the normal samples, and then train a generative adversarial network to reconstruct the unseen regions. Note that the masks are designed in multiple scales and stripe directions, and various training examples are generated to obtain the rich semantic context . In testing, we obtain an error map by computing the difference between the reconstructed image and the input image for all samples, and infer the abnormal samples based on the error maps. Finally, we perform various experiments on three public benchmark datasets and a new dataset LaceAD collected by us, and show that our method clearly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Support Vector Data Description', 'abstract': 'Data domain description concerns the characterization of a data set. A good description covers all target data but includes no superfluous space. The boundary of a dataset can be used to detect novel data or outliers. We will present the Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) which is inspired by the Support Vector Classifier. It obtains a spherically shaped boundary around a dataset and analogous to the Support Vector Classifier it can be made flexible by using other kernel functions. The method is made robust against outliers in the training set and is capable of tightening the description by using negative examples. We show characteristics of the Support Vector Data Descriptions using artificial and real data.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'OmniAL: A Unified CNN Framework for Unsupervised Anomaly Localization', 'abstract': 'Unsupervised anomaly localization and detection is crucial for industrial manufacturing processes due to the lack of anomalous samples. Recent unsupervised advances on industrial anomaly detection achieve high performance by training separate models for many different categories. The model storage and training time cost of this paradigm is high. Moreover, the setting of one-model-N-classes leads to fearful degradation of existing methods. In this paper, we propose a unified CNN framework for unsupervised anomaly localization, named OmniAL. This method conquers aforementioned problems by improving anomaly synthesis, reconstruction and localization. To prevent the model learning identical reconstruction, it trains the model with proposed panel-guided synthetic anomaly data rather than directly using normal data. It increases anomaly reconstruction error for multi-class distribution by using a network that is equipped with proposed Dilated Channel and Spatial Attention (DCSA) blocks. To better localize the anomaly regions, it employs proposed DiffNeck between reconstruction and localization sub-networks to explore multi-level differences. Experiments on 15-class MVTecAD and 12-class VisA datasets verify the advantage of proposed OmniAL that surpasses the state-of-the-art of unified models. On 15-class-MVTecAD/12-class-VisA, its single unified model achieves 97.2/87.8 image-AUROC, 98.3/96.6 pixel-AUROC and 73.4/41.7 pixel-AP for anomaly detection and localization respectively. Besides that, we make the first attempt to conduct a comprehensive study on the robustness of unsupervised anomaly localization and detection methods against different level adversarial attacks. Experiential results show OmniAL has good application prospects for its superior performance.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Exploring Simple Siamese Representation Learning', 'abstract': 'Siamese networks have become a common structure in various recent models for unsupervised visual representation learning. These models maximize the similarity between two augmentations of one image, subject to certain conditions for avoiding collapsing solutions. In this paper, we report surprising empirical results that simple Siamese networks can learn meaningful representations even using none of the following: (i) negative sample pairs, (ii) large batches, (iii) momentum encoders. Our experiments show that collapsing solutions do exist for the loss and structure, but a stop-gradient operation plays an essential role in preventing collapsing. We provide a hypothesis on the implication of stop-gradient, and further show proof-of-concept experiments verifying it. Our \"SimSiam\" method achieves competitive results on ImageNet and downstream tasks. We hope this simple baseline will motivate people to rethink the roles of Siamese architectures for unsupervised representation learning. Code is made available.1'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'PaDiM: A Patch Distribution Modeling Framework for Anomaly Detection and Localization', 'abstract': 'We present a new framework for Patch Distribution Modeling, PaDiM, to concurrently detect and localize anomalies in images in a one-class learning setting. PaDiM makes use of a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) for patch embedding, and of multivariate Gaussian distributions to get a probabilistic representation of the normal class. It also exploits correlations between the different semantic levels of CNN to better localize anomalies. PaDiM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches for both anomaly detection and localization on the MVTec AD and STC datasets. To match real-world visual industrial inspection, we extend the evaluation protocol to assess performance of anomaly localization algorithms on non-aligned dataset. The state-of-the-art performance and low complexity of PaDiM make it a good candidate for many industrial applications.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'ChatGPT for Vulnerability Detection, Classification, and Repair: How Far Are We?', 'abstract': \"Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT (i.e., gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4) exhibited remarkable advancement in a range of software engineering tasks associated with source code such as code review and code generation. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study by instructing ChatGPT for four prevalent vulnerability tasks: function and line-level vulnerability prediction, vulnerability classification, severity estimation, and vulnerability repair. We compare ChatGPT with state-of-the-art language models designed for software vulnerability purposes. Through an empirical assessment employing extensive real-world datasets featuring over 190,000 C/C++ functions, we found that ChatGPT achieves limited performance, trailing behind other language models in vulnerability contexts by a significant margin. The experimental outcomes highlight the challenging nature of vulnerability prediction tasks, requiring domain-specific expertise. Despite ChatGPT's substantial model scale, exceeding that of source code-pre-trained language models (e.g., CodeBERT) by a factor of 14,000, the process of fine-tuning remains imperative for ChatGPT to generalize for vulnerability prediction tasks.

We crawled the public Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database and CVE-related source code repositories. Specifically, we collected the descriptive information of the vulnerabilities from the CVE database, e.g., CVE IDs, CVE severity scores, and CVE summaries. With the CVE information and its related published Github code repository links, we downloaded all of the code repositories and extracted vulnerability related code changes. In total, Big-Vul contains 3,754 code vulnerabilities spanning 91 different vulnerability types. All these code vulnerabilities are extracted from 348 Github projects. All information is stored in the CSV format. We linked the code changes with the CVE descriptive information.

Big-Vul is publicly available on Github.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Modeling and Discovering Vulnerabilities with Code Property Graphs', 'abstract': \"The vast majority of security breaches encountered today are a direct result of insecure code. Consequently, the protection of computer systems critically depends on the rigorous identification of vulnerabilities in software, a tedious and error-prone process requiring significant expertise. Unfortunately, a single flaw suffices to undermine the security of a system and thus the sheer amount of code to audit plays into the attacker's cards. In this paper, we present a method to effectively mine large amounts of source code for vulnerabilities. To this end, we introduce a novel representation of source code called a code property graph that merges concepts of classic program analysis, namely abstract syntax trees, control flow graphs and program dependence graphs, into a joint data structure. This comprehensive representation enables us to elegantly model templates for common vulnerabilities with graph traversals that, for instance, can identify buffer overflows, integer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or memory disclosures. We implement our approach using a popular graph database and demonstrate its efficacy by identifying 18 previously unknown vulnerabilities in the source code of the Linux kernel.\"}]\n```\n\n**Part A.2: The Evolution Links (Edges of the Graph):**\nThe following list defines the citation relationships between the papers in Part A.

    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem in the contemporary research landscape revolves around achieving robust unsupervised anomaly detection, anomaly localization, and vulnerability detection within complex data domains such as images and source code, supporting the development and security of large language models (LLMs). Dominant methodologies leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision-language models, and one-class learning settings to extract semantic context from normal samples, enabling detection of anomalies without labeled anomalous data. Notably, techniques like Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) and Siamese-based representation learning underpin state-of-the-art approaches. This evolution reflects a response to earlier limitations in supervised anomaly detection and vulnerability detection requiring extensive labeled datasets, moving toward more scalable, flexible unsupervised frameworks. Furthermore, efforts have integrated multimodal data (vision-language) to improve anomaly detection efficacy in industrial contexts. In parallel, vulnerability datasets and graph-based code representations (e.g., code property graphs) have advanced understanding of code-level security risks, highlighting the intersection of NLP, software engineering, and cybersecurity relevant to LLM development.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internally, the trajectory reveals persistent challenges in guaranteeing privacy-preserving collection and utilization of diverse linguistic data, especially because anomaly and vulnerability detection methods focus heavily on performance and less on protecting sensitive data during training and deployment. There is limited exploration of privacy-preserving techniques (such as federated learning or differential privacy) integrated into unsupervised anomaly detection or vulnerability identification frameworks for LLM training datasets. Additionally, the analyses reflect insufficient bridging between advanced vision-language anomaly detection methods and code vulnerability detection, leaving a siloed development landscape. External gaps highlighted by global co-occurrence analysis point to overlooked cross-disciplinary synergies, such as leveraging graph neural networks and federated learning methods from cybersecurity and anomaly detection literature to enhance privacy in linguistic data collection. Moreover, temporal and sequential dependencies—critical for language data modeling—are underrepresented in current anomaly detection paradigms primarily focused on static image or code snapshots. The nexus of federated privacy approaches with vision-language and code analysis modules remains underexplored, signaling a significant frontier.",
