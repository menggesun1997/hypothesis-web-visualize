    "title": "Typology-Aware Data Augmentation for Low-Resource Language Pretraining",
    "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource languages are underrepresented in large-scale pretraining corpora, leading to poor model performance, especially when typological features are unique and complex.",
    "Motivation": "This tackles internal gaps in data scarcity and inadequate typology representation by creating augmentation strategies reflecting true typological phenomena during training data synthesis.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design typology-guided data augmentation pipelines that apply morphological templating, syntactic reordering, and phonological variation reflecting the target language's typological characteristics, generating diverse synthetic corpora enhancing pretraining efficacy for LLMs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Identify key typological traits for target low-resource languages; 2) Develop augmentation operations (e.g., agglutination simulation, word order permutations); 3) Generate synthetic textual data augmenting limited existing corpora; 4) Use this synthetic data for pretraining or continual pretraining of multilingual LLMs; 5) Evaluate downstream task performance and representation richness versus no-augmentation baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Generating morphologically rich synthetic sentences in Quechua exhibiting suffix complexation and free word order. Expected output: Improved masked language modeling loss and downstream task performance in Quechua vs. naive augmentation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If augmentation reduces data quality, introduce quality control filters based on linguistic acceptability heuristics or human-in-the-loop feedback."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is conceptually sound but lacks detailed methodology on how the typology-guided augmentation operations (morphological templating, syntactic reordering, phonological variation) will be systematically designed, validated, and integrated. Consider elaborating on the criteria and linguistic resources used to identify typological traits, the algorithms or rule-based systems employed for augmentation, and evaluation metrics specifically targeting the fidelity of synthetic data (not just downstream task performance). This will improve reproducibility and feasibility assessments by peers and facilitate identification of failure modes earlier, reducing risk in pretraining phases. Additionally, clarify how continual pretraining will be balanced with existing corpora to prevent model forgetting or negative transfer especially given low-resource scenarios, which often complicate stable learning dynamics in multilingual LLMs with potentially out-of-distribution inputs from synthetic augmentation. Incorporating quality-control checkpoints in the experiment plan rather than just as a fallback would strengthen robustness and practical viability from the outset.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty judgment as NOV-COMPETITIVE, the idea can be strengthened by explicitly integrating insights and resources from 'traditional linguistics' and 'rule-driven approaches' alongside recent advances in 'stable learning' and 'out-of-distribution problem' research. For instance, leveraging well-established phoneme-based modeling and dependency parsing techniques from computational linguistics to formalize the augmentation pipelines could enhance robustness and linguistic accuracy. Furthermore, engaging with 'linguistic diversity' datasets such as multilingual speech corpora or African languages datasets could broaden the impact beyond select typologically complex languages. Embedding critical digital literacies and language acquisition perspectives may help design augmentations that not only improve model metrics but also promote language technology inclusion, fostering sustainable NLP ecosystems for low-resource languages. Such multidimensional integration could elevate novelty, scientific contribution, and real-world relevance across research and community stakeholders."
