        "title": "Federated Differential Privacy for Unsupervised Linguistic Anomaly Detection",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current unsupervised anomaly detection frameworks for linguistic data lack strong privacy guarantees, inhibiting large-scale data collection from diverse users due to privacy concerns. There is a pressing need to enable decentralized training of models for detecting anomalies in language datasets without accessing raw user data.",
        "Motivation": "This research addresses the internal gap of insufficient integration of privacy-preserving techniques like federated learning and differential privacy into unsupervised anomaly detection frameworks for LLM datasets. By combining these approaches, we target the challenge of safeguarding sensitive linguistic information during model training, fulfilling a high-potential innovation space identified in the landscape map.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel federated learning framework that incorporates differentially private updates into unsupervised anomaly detection architectures leveraging vision-language transformers adapted for linguistic features. The model trains locally on user devices with privacy-preserving noise added to gradients, aggregating model updates on a central server without exposing raw data. A custom one-class representation learner integrated with differential privacy mechanisms learns robust normal language patterns to detect anomalous or biased linguistic instances without labeled data.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect a multi-source linguistic dataset simulating sensitive private data. 2) Implement a baseline centralized unsupervised anomaly detection model (e.g., SVDD or Siamese representations). 3) Develop federated learning infrastructure supporting differential privacy. 4) Train the federated differentially private anomaly detection model. 5) Evaluate model performance on detecting anomalies and measure privacy guarantees (epsilon-delta privacy metrics). 6) Compare against centralized and non-private federated baselines using precision, recall, F1 score, and privacy budget.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User-generated sentence stream containing normal language and subtle biased or injected anomalous linguistic patterns (e.g., offensive phrase insertion). Expected Output: The model flags anomalous linguistic data points with high confidence while preserving user data privacy, evidenced by adherence to privacy budgets and anomaly detection metrics.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If training with differential privacy deteriorates detection performance, explore relaxed privacy guarantees and hybrid approaches combining secure multi-party computation for aggregation. Alternatively, isolate model components for privacy-preserving embeddings and investigate adaptive privacy budgets per user data distribution."

        "Problem_Statement": "Anomaly and vulnerability detection systems for LLM training data are siloed across modalities—vision-language or code—resulting in missed cross-modal semantic anomalies important for comprehensive linguistic data security and quality assurance.",
        "Motivation": "The project directly addresses the external gap of siloed modality-specific anomaly detection by leveraging the hidden bridge of graph neural networks (GNNs) as unifying structures to integrate multimodal knowledge and anomalies from vision, language, and code sources, fulfilling high-potential innovation opportunity #2 from the landscape analysis.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a cross-modal graph neural network architecture that constructs a unified heterogeneous graph with nodes representing visual elements, textual tokens, and code constructs (e.g., AST nodes or code property graph components) extracted from LLM training datasets. GNN layers model semantic and structural relationships across modalities capturing complex anomaly interactions. An unsupervised anomaly scoring mechanism identifies outliers in this multimodal graph embedding space, highlighting joint anomalies potentially overlooked by modality-isolated systems.",

        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A multimodal sample consisting of an image containing text, paired with source code embedding an intentional semantic vulnerability. Expected Output: The system flags the joint anomaly involving corrupt visual-textual semantics and code vulnerability at corresponding graph nodes, indicating hidden multi-source risks.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the unified graph representation becomes too complex or noisy, decompose training into modality-pairwise subnetworks with cross-attention layers. Alternatively, focus on graph regularization and pruning to improve meaningful cross-modal connectivity."

Periodic aggregation of encrypted model parameters at a central server updates a global cross-modal anomaly detector. Privacy-preserving mechanisms (secure aggregation and differential privacy) ensure user and data privacy.
