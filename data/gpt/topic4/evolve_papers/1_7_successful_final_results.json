        "title": "Typology-Aware, Rule-Driven Data Augmentation with Stable Learning for Low-Resource Language Pretraining",
        "Problem_Statement": "Low-resource languages suffer from underrepresentation in large-scale pretraining corpora, which limits language model performance, especially when such languages have unique and complex typological features. Existing augmentation methods often lack systematic linguistic grounding and robust quality control, resulting in synthetic data that may harm rather than help training.",
        "Motivation": "To advance language technology inclusivity and robustness, this work leverages established traditional linguistics, phoneme-based modeling, and rule-driven computational linguistics to create more linguistically faithful data augmentation pipelines. Coupling these with research on stable continual learning and out-of-distribution robustness addresses fundamental gaps in current augmentation frameworks for low-resource languages. By integrating diverse linguistic knowledge and digital literacy perspectives, the method promotes sustainable, impactful NLP systems that transcend mere metric gains — fostering deeper language acquisition, understanding, and technological inclusion for typologically diverse, low-resource communities.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a typology-aware, multi-layered, and rule-driven augmentation framework that: (1) systematically identifies key typological traits using comprehensive linguistic databases (e.g., WALS, phoneme inventories, dependency parses from Universal Dependencies) and collaborates with native speaker resources; (2) develops modular augmentation operations including phoneme-based morphological templating, linguistically informed syntactic reordering guided by dependency parsing, and phonological variation grounded in established phoneme modeling techniques; (3) implements augmentation algorithms as an end-to-end interpretable pipeline with built-in quality control checkpoints using linguistic acceptability metrics, human-in-the-loop validation, and probabilistic error estimations; (4) employs stable continual learning strategies — such as balanced sampling, replay buffers with real/synthetic data mixing, and regularization methods — to integrate synthetic corpora with existing multilingual corpora, mitigating forgetting and negative transfer; (5) evaluates not only downstream task performance but also synthetic data fidelity through linguistically motivated metrics, embedding distribution alignment, and robustness tests against out-of-distribution challenges; (6) broadens impact by validating on linguistically diverse datasets including African languages and multilingual speech corpora, thereby embedding critical digital literacy elements and reflecting real-world linguistic diversity.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Survey and extract typological features relevant for target low-resource languages leveraging linguistic resources such as WALS, Universal Dependencies, and native speaker expertise;\n2) Formalize augmentation rules: develop phoneme-based morphological templating algorithms; design syntactic reordering modules informed by dependency parses; encode phonological variations per phoneme inventories;\n3) Implement end-to-end augmentation pipeline embedding quality control checkpoints at each stage — automatic linguistic acceptability scoring, anomaly detection, and periodic human-in-loop review to filter and refine synthetic outputs;\n4) Generate synthetic data augmenting the native corpora for selected low-resource languages with varying typologies (e.g., Quechua, select African languages);\n5) Integrate synthetic data into continual pretraining of multilingual language models using stable learning protocols — balanced mixing strategies, replay buffers, and regularization to prevent negative transfer or forgetting;\n6) Assess synthetic data fidelity via novel linguistically grounded metrics (morphological complexity fidelity, syntactic distribution similarity, phonological realism), embedding space analysis, alongside downstream tasks (masked language modeling, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing);\n7) Conduct robustness experiments addressing out-of-distribution phenomena resulting from augmented data;\n8) Expand evaluation to include multilingual speech corpora and language acquisition indicators, incorporating critical digital literacy aspects to assess societal relevance and inclusivity impacts.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Generate morphologically rich synthetic sentences in Quechua exhibiting suffix complexation, free word order permutations corroborated by dependency parses, and phoneme-level alternations mapped to native phonological processes.\nExpected Output: Synthetic data exhibiting high linguistic fidelity as measured by morphological and syntactic metrics; downstream model improvements in masked language modeling loss, syntactic parsing accuracy, and robustness against novel inputs versus naive augmentation baselines.\nAdditional Case: Application to select African languages with tonal phoneme augmentation and rule-driven morphosyntactic variations validated against multilingual speech corpora, demonstrating broad applicability and linguistic inclusion.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If initial augmentation pipelines produce lower data fidelity or degrade model performance, we will iterate augmentation rules leveraging error analysis from quality control checkpoints. Alternative fallback strategies include incrementally incorporating more human-in-the-loop feedback, adjusting stable learning hyperparameters to better balance synthetic and real data, and integrating existing high-quality multilingual speech datasets to enrich phoneme modeling and syntactic representations. Should the continuous pretraining risk negative transfer remain high, focused fine-tuning on augmented smaller batches or meta-learning adaptations will be explored. Continuous engagement with linguists and native speakers will guide fallback revisions to ensure linguistic accuracy and practical utility."

Consider elaborating on the criteria and linguistic resources used to identify typological traits, the algorithms or rule-based systems employed for augmentation, and evaluation metrics specifically targeting the fidelity of synthetic data (not just downstream task performance). This will improve reproducibility and feasibility assessments by peers and facilitate identification of failure modes earlier, reducing risk in pretraining phases. Additionally, clarify how continual pretraining will be balanced with existing corpora to prevent model forgetting or negative transfer especially given low-resource scenarios, which often complicate stable learning dynamics in multilingual LLMs with potentially out-of-distribution inputs from synthetic augmentation. Incorporating quality-control checkpoints in the experiment plan rather than just as a fallback would strengthen robustness and practical viability from the outset.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty judgment as NOV-COMPETITIVE, the idea can be strengthened by explicitly integrating insights and resources from 'traditional linguistics' and 'rule-driven approaches' alongside recent advances in 'stable learning' and 'out-of-distribution problem' research. For instance, leveraging well-established phoneme-based modeling and dependency parsing techniques from computational linguistics to formalize the augmentation pipelines could enhance robustness and linguistic accuracy. Furthermore, engaging with 'linguistic diversity' datasets such as multilingual speech corpora or African languages datasets could broaden the impact beyond select typologically complex languages. Embedding critical digital literacies and language acquisition perspectives may help design augmentations that not only improve model metrics but also promote language technology inclusion, fostering sustainable NLP ecosystems for low-resource languages. Such multidimensional integration could elevate novelty, scientific contribution, and real-world relevance across research and community stakeholders."
