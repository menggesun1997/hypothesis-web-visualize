        "title": "Adaptive Lightweight Few-Shot LLMs for Low-Resource Linguistic Programming",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language models (LLMs) for software engineering tasks are predominantly trained and evaluated on English-centric datasets, limiting their effectiveness in linguistically diverse and resource-constrained environments. There is a lack of compact, efficient adaptation methods that can learn from scarce, diverse linguistic data, crucial for low-resource, non-English programming contexts.",
        "Motivation": "This idea directly addresses Critical Gap (1) and (2) by targeting linguistic diversity and resource constraints and capitalizes on High-Potential Innovation Opportunity 1 by proposing resource-efficient few-shot adaptation protocols specifically designed for diverse linguistic scenarios.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel adaptive framework combining meta-learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning via modular adapters specialized for distinct linguistic traits (syntax, morphology, dialect) to enable efficient learning from few-shot, imbalanced data. The method employs a hierarchical language representation aligning shared program semantics with linguistic variance, and integrates lightweight curriculum learning to progressively adapt LLMs to underrepresented languages. The framework is designed to minimize additional computational overhead while maximizing linguistic generalization.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multilingual and dialectal code-related datasets with annotations for language features and resource levels. 2. Implement baseline models: standard fine-tuning and full LLMs on English data. 3. Develop modular adapters for linguistic traits and incorporate meta-learning for few-shot generalization. 4. Perform evaluation on multilingual benchmarks measuring code generation accuracy, semantic correctness, and computational resource usage. 5. Compare with existing prompt engineering and semantic augmentation baselines. Metrics: BLEU, CodeBLEU, resource footprint (memory, inference time), and cross-lingual adaptability scores.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A prompt in a low-resource dialect mixing local language syntax with English-based programming terms requesting code completion for a sorting function. Expected Output: Correct syntactically valid code respecting the dialect syntax influences, with semantically accurate sorting logic.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If modular adapter learning does not yield sufficient adaptation, fallback to leveraging zero-shot cross-lingual transfer with augmented synthetic data generation and focus on semi-supervised adaptation pipelines. Additional error analysis will prioritize identifying linguistic traits that fail to generalize to refine adapter modules."

        "title": "Semantic Augmentation Catalog for Multilingual and Dialectal Programming Contexts",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing semantic augmentation catalogs for software engineering LLMs largely exclude multilingual and dialectal variations, impairing model robustness and applicability in highly linguistically diverse programming environments. This gap restricts cross-lingual code comprehension and generation.",
        "Motivation": "This project targets Critical Gap (1) and (3) around underrepresentation of linguistic diversity in semantic resources, exploiting High-Potential Innovation Opportunity 2 by systematically expanding catalogs with multilingual semantic patterns and dialect-specific augmentations.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose constructing an extensible multilingual semantic pattern catalog that captures language- and dialect-specific semantic augmentations for software engineering tasks. This catalog will be built by mining multimodal corpora (code + natural language comments) across diverse linguistic communities, utilizing unsupervised semantic clustering and cross-lingual embedding alignment to discover latent semantic variants and idiomatic code expressions influenced by local languages. Integration plugins will allow LLMs to dynamically query and apply these patterns during prompt engineering and execution.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate multilingual and dialectal datasets from open-source repositories and localized coding communities. 2. Develop unsupervised semantic pattern detection algorithms using multilingual embeddings (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R). 3. Create a structured catalog format incorporating linguistic metadata. 4. Integrate catalog querying mechanisms into prompt engineering pipelines. 5. Evaluate impact on multilingual code generation quality and robustness comparing baseline augmentation without the catalog.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Code snippet and comment in Spanish-Andalusian dialect requesting bug fixes. Expected Output: Code suggestions that reflect dialect-influenced semantic patterns in comments and idiomatic variable naming conventions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If unsupervised pattern extraction proves noisy, fallback to a semi-supervised approach leveraging linguist-annotated semantic patterns and community-driven annotation campaigns to refine the catalog quality. Alternatively, develop a simpler rule-based pattern extraction for initial deployment."

        "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Socio-Linguistically Aware LLM Adaptation Framework",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM adaptation techniques for software engineering do not integrate sociolinguistic knowledge, missing nuanced language and cultural factors affecting programming language usage and documentation in diverse communities, which hinders model interpretability and generalization.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses Critical Gap (3) and the unexploited 'hidden bridge' of sociolinguistics from the external gap analysis, aligning with High-Potential Innovation Opportunity 3 by bridging sociolinguistics with model-driven engineering for culturally aware LLM adaptation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel framework embedding sociolinguistic features (e.g., politeness strategies, dialectal syntax, multilingual code-switching tendencies) as formal constraints into model-driven engineering pipelines. This framework incorporates interpretable modular LLM architectures that adapt dynamically based on detected sociolinguistic context, enabling models to generate contextually appropriate code and documentation. Integration of cultural knowledge graphs and adaptive reasoning modules allows fluid modulation to respect linguistic nuance while maintaining computational efficiency via model pruning informed by sociolinguistic relevance.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble curated datasets annotated with sociolinguistic features relevant to programming and documentation. 2. Develop sociolinguistic feature extractors and integrate them within model-driven engineering adaptation loops. 3. Construct modular LLM components conditioned on sociolinguistic signals. 4. Benchmark adapted models on cross-cultural software engineering tasks for interpretability, code quality, and model size. 5. Compare with standard models lacking sociolinguistic adaptations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Software requirement specification written in a code-mixed context with politeness markers typical of a South Asian community. Expected Output: Generated code comments and variable names that respect the sociolinguistic nuances while producing syntactically valid and semantically accurate code.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If sociolinguistic feature integration impacts computational efficiency negatively, fallback involves simplifying features to the most impactful subset identified via ablation, or applying features during post-processing generation reranking instead of model adaptation."

        "title": "Distributed Federated Adaptation of LLMs for Low-Resource Linguistic Programming Communities",
        "Problem_Statement": "Resource constraints limit deployment of large, adaptive LLMs in geographically dispersed, low-resource programming communities with diverse languages and dialects, preventing effective localized adaptation and knowledge sharing.",
        "Motivation": "This idea exploits the external unexploited 'hidden bridge' of distributed computing for model efficiency (Critical Gap external) and addresses internal gaps (1) and (2) by proposing a federated learning paradigm for resource-efficient, privacy-preserving LLM adaptation across linguistically diverse communities.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a federated adaptation framework where lightweight LLM variants reside locally within participating nodes representing linguistic communities. These variants adapt using local low-resource data via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., adapters or LoRA) and share aggregated updates centrally with privacy-preserving mechanisms (differential privacy, secure aggregation). A global orchestrator synthesizes a meta-model capturing cross-lingual generalizations while respecting resource constraints and linguistic diversity. Communication compression and adaptive scheduling optimize bandwidth and energy usage.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Simulate federated networks using multilingual datasets split by language and dialect. 2. Implement baseline fine-tuning vs federated adaptation with resource metrics. 3. Evaluate code generation performance, linguistic generalization, resource consumption, and privacy guarantees. 4. Conduct ablation on adaptation frequency and communication efficiency. Metrics: CodeBLEU, communication overhead, privacy leakage quantification.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Local code bug-fixing dataset from an indigenous language-based programming community. Expected Output: Improved localized code completion with minimal performance degradation on global benchmarks.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated updates suffer from instability or catastrophic forgetting, fallback involves personalized federated learning with regularization or hybrid centralized-federated adaptation pipelines. Also consider controlled client selection for stability."

        "title": "Hierarchical Multilingual Prompt Engineering Integrating Language Ecology for Software Tasks",
        "Problem_Statement": "Prompt engineering techniques for LLMs in software tasks do not systematically incorporate hierarchical linguistic context or language ecology factors, limiting adaptability and performance in high linguistic diversity contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses Critical Gap (1) and (3) by injecting linguistic ecological insights into prompt engineering, extending High-Potential Innovation Opportunity 2 in semantic pattern catalog expansion with a hierarchical linguistic-aware prompt design paradigm.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hierarchical prompt engineering framework that models language ecology (language contact, diglossia, code-switching) to dynamically generate multi-layered prompts tailored for software engineering tasks. It uses a meta-prompt controller that selects and composes prompt modules conditioned on detected linguistic context, supported by a multilingual semantic pattern catalog. The system is designed to leverage lightweight modules that reflect linguistic hierarchy from phonology to syntax impacting prompt phrasing and semantic augmentation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Compile codebench datasets with sociolinguistically annotated prompt inputs. 2. Build a library of linguistic ecology-informed prompt modules. 3. Train a meta-prompt controller using reinforcement learning optimizing for accuracy and robustness in multilingual code tasks. 4. Evaluate against baseline flat prompt engineering models. Metrics: task accuracy, prompt efficiency, adaptability across languages.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt in a creole-influenced code-mixed dialect asking for code snippet generation. Expected Output: Code generation reflecting creole influenced idiomatic expressions represented through hierarchical prompts.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If reinforcement learning optimization is unstable, fallback to supervised learning based on expert-crafted prompt compositions or heuristic rule-based linguistic context encoding for prompt selection."
