    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a novel embedding regularization loss that penalizes divergence from a typology-derived embedding manifold during training or fine-tuning. Typological distances computed from databases like WALS guide the embedding proximity constraints, encouraging embeddings of typologically similar languages to cluster while preserving meaningful task-specific distances.",

        "title": "Typology-Constrained Embedding Space Regularization with Human-Centered Evaluation for Multilingual LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current multilingual large language models (LLMs) often organize language embeddings predominantly by language family or script rather than by deeper typological features. This limits their ability to generalize across typologically similar but genetically distant languages and hinders bias mitigation in underrepresented languages. Additionally, existing approaches lack clear, stable mechanisms to balance typology-based constraints against task-specific demands during model fine-tuning.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work emphasizes family- or script-based clustering, typological features (morphosyntactic, phonological, etc.) offer richer structural signals that can improve multilingual LLM generalization and equitable performance. Our approach is novel in explicitly regularizing embedding spaces with typological distances grounded in linguistic databases, carefully balancing these constraints with downstream task requirements through a well-defined integrated loss function. Beyond theoretical gains, incorporating human-centered AI perspectives, we connect embedding improvements to real-world benefits for underrepresented language communities—particularly those with divergent typological features, such as Indic languages and varieties of World Englishes. This positions our work to drive socially impactful, human-computer interaction improvements in multilingual NLP applications.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel, mathematically explicit embedding regularization framework that integrates typological constraints directly into the fine-tuning objective of multilingual LLMs. Specifically, given a batch of language embeddings \\(E = \\{e_1, e_2, ..., e_n\\}\\), and a typological distance matrix \\(T\\) derived from databases like WALS, we define the total loss as:\n\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_{total} = \\mathcal{L}_{task} + \\lambda \\cdot \\mathcal{L}_{typology},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\n\\mathcal{L}_{typology} = \\sum_{i,j} \\left( \\|e_i - e_j\\|_2 - f(T_{ij}) \\right)^2\n\\) enforces the learned embedding distances to approximate a monotonic mapping \\(f(\\cdot)\\) of typological distances \\(T_{ij}\\). This encourages embeddings of typologically similar languages to cluster while respecting task-driven relational nuances.\n\nTo balance conflicting gradients between the task loss and typology regularization — especially where typological similarity does not align with task semantics — we:\n\n1. Employ a learnable, monotonic scaling function \\(f\\) parameterized via a neural network to flexibly map typological distances to embedding space constraints.\n2. Utilize gradient projection techniques at each optimization step to resolve conflicts, ensuring stable convergence.\n3. Schedule \\(\\lambda\\) dynamically, starting with a low value and increasing as fine-tuning progresses to prevent early training destabilization.\n\nTo ground this in human-centered AI, we incorporate user-centered case studies targeting underrepresented linguistic communities, measuring both automatic metrics and qualitative usability improvements resulting from typology-aware embeddings.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct pairwise typological distance matrix \\(T\\) for a typologically diverse set of languages using WALS and other linguistic resources.\n2) Implement the typology-constrained regularization loss integrated into fine-tuning of state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R).\n3) Develop gradient conflict resolution and dynamic balancing \\(\\lambda\\) scheduling mechanisms.\n4) Fine-tune models on diverse multilingual NLP benchmarks covering typologically varied languages, including tasks sensitive to typological traits.\n5) Conduct embedding space analyses using PCA, t-SNE, and cluster evaluation metrics to quantify alignment with typological distances.\n6) Design and execute human-centered evaluation protocols with multilingual users from underrepresented language communities (e.g., speakers of Indic languages and World Englishes) to assess practical usability and perceived fairness.\n7) Compare against baselines without typology constraints and with family/script-based constraints.\n8) Perform ablation studies to validate the roles of gradient conflict resolution and adaptive \\(\\lambda\\) scheduling.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multilingual embedding matrices containing languages such as Turkish, Finnish, Hindi, and Singlish (a World English variety).\nExpected Outcome: Refined embeddings reflect typological features like agglutinative morphology (Turkish, Finnish), syntactic and phonological patterns unique to Indic languages (Hindi), and creole-influenced patterns in Singlish, beyond mere genetic family or script clustering. Downstream tasks — e.g., multilingual question answering and sentiment analysis — demonstrate improved cross-lingual transfer and bias mitigation, particularly for typologically atypical and underrepresented languages. Human user studies report enhanced usability and reduced misinterpretations tied to typology-aware model outputs.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If training instabilities persist despite gradient conflict resolution and dynamic regularization scheduling, we will explore a multitask learning paradigm where the model jointly predicts typological properties as auxiliary tasks instead of imposing strict embedding-space distance constraints. This softer approach preserves typological signals in representations while maintaining stable optimization. Additionally, we will investigate modular adapter layers specialized for typology, thereby decoupling task-specific and typology-informed representations to reduce interference."

The proposal should clarify how the regularization loss integrates mathematically with existing task losses, how conflicts between typological and task-driven gradients are resolved, and whether the method handles cases where typological similarity does not align with task semantics. Providing a formal loss function and discussing optimization stability would strengthen the soundness of the method section significantly, especially given the fallback plan's mention of training instability issues.—This will guide implementers and reviewers to assess viability more clearly and anticipate challenges ahead. This is critical for adoption and reproducibility in multilingual LLMs fine-tuning contexts. Target: Proposed_Method section."
