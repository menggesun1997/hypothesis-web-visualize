    "title": "Differentially Private Siamese Networks for Federated Unsupervised Linguistic Anomaly Localization",
    "Problem_Statement": "Localization of anomalies in linguistic data—identifying specific tokens or segments responsible—is crucial for interpretability but remains unexplored in privacy-preserving federated unsupervised frameworks.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the internal privacy gap and anomaly localization needs, this idea pioneers combining Siamese representation learning with differential privacy in a federated setting to enable both effective anomaly detection and precise localization without compromising sensitive user data.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We design a federated Siamese network architecture where paired normal linguistic samples are locally encoded with privacy-preserving noise added to gradients. This model captures fine-grained semantic similarity patterns to learn compact normal representations. Anomaly localization is performed by comparing new inputs with learned normal embeddings and back-tracing to token-level discrepancies using integrated gradients or attention maps. All training and localization computations respect differential privacy constraints.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect linguistic datasets segmented by tokens or phrases. 2) Implement centralized Siamese baseline for anomaly detection and localization. 3) Extend to federated training with differential privacy. 4) Evaluate detection accuracy and localization precision (e.g., token-wise F1). 5) Measure privacy budget impact. 6) Perform qualitative analysis of localization heatmaps in privacy scenarios.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Linguistic input containing subtle biased phrases among normal text segments. Expected Output: The model flags the input as anomalous and highlights specific biased tokens as sources of anomaly while respecting privacy guarantees.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If localization signal weakens under privacy noise, explore semi-supervised fine-tuning with pseudo-labeling or differential privacy budget relaxation. Alternatively, combine with explainability frameworks that do not require gradient access."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section outlines a federated Siamese network with differential privacy noise added to gradients for unsupervised linguistic anomaly localization. However, the explanation lacks clarity on how integrated gradients or attention maps can be reliably computed and interpreted under strict differential privacy constraints, especially when noise is introduced during backpropagation. Please clarify the mechanism by which token-level localization signals remain meaningful despite privacy-preserving noise and federated aggregation. Providing more formal justification or preliminary proof-of-concept results would strengthen soundness here; otherwise, the approach risks token-level explanations that degrade severely under privacy noise, undermining interpretability claims and anomaly localization utility in a federated setting. This gap is crucial to address before proceeding further, as it impacts the core technical validity and feasibility of the approach in practice from both privacy and interpretability perspectives. A deeper discussion or analysis of privacy-utility tradeoffs in the explanation signals is strongly recommended, potentially leveraging recent advances in privacy-preserving explainability literature to solidify this aspect of the method design and increase confidence in the approach’s viability and clarity of mechanism. The revised section should also explicitly define how Siamese similarity scores translate into token-level importance under federated differential privacy constraints, leaving no ambiguity in the core algorithmic flow and its consistency with privacy guarantees.

Specifically: \n1) The plan should specify how the federated data distributions will realistically reflect heterogeneous client data, which often affects convergence and model robustness in federated settings.\n2) The plan does not address computational and communication overheads of differentially private gradient sharing in the Siamese network during federated training; these can be substantial and might limit practical applicability.\n3) Metrics for privacy budget evaluation appear underspecified; it would be beneficial to include plans for rigorously measuring privacy loss (epsilon, delta parameters) and its impact on detection/localization tradeoffs.\n4) The fallback plan mentions semi-supervised fine-tuning and combining with explainability frameworks that do not require gradient access, but the experiment plan should integrate these contingencies more concretely as alternative experiments or ablation studies.\nIncluding these refinements will strengthen the plan's realism and demonstrate clear foresight about federated differential privacy challenges, aiding reproducibility and encouraging more rigorous validation.\n(Target: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)"
