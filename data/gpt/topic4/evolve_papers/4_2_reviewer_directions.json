    "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Socio-Linguistically Aware LLM Adaptation Framework",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM adaptation techniques for software engineering do not integrate sociolinguistic knowledge, missing nuanced language and cultural factors affecting programming language usage and documentation in diverse communities, which hinders model interpretability and generalization.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses Critical Gap (3) and the unexploited 'hidden bridge' of sociolinguistics from the external gap analysis, aligning with High-Potential Innovation Opportunity 3 by bridging sociolinguistics with model-driven engineering for culturally aware LLM adaptation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel framework embedding sociolinguistic features (e.g., politeness strategies, dialectal syntax, multilingual code-switching tendencies) as formal constraints into model-driven engineering pipelines. This framework incorporates interpretable modular LLM architectures that adapt dynamically based on detected sociolinguistic context, enabling models to generate contextually appropriate code and documentation. Integration of cultural knowledge graphs and adaptive reasoning modules allows fluid modulation to respect linguistic nuance while maintaining computational efficiency via model pruning informed by sociolinguistic relevance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble curated datasets annotated with sociolinguistic features relevant to programming and documentation. 2. Develop sociolinguistic feature extractors and integrate them within model-driven engineering adaptation loops. 3. Construct modular LLM components conditioned on sociolinguistic signals. 4. Benchmark adapted models on cross-cultural software engineering tasks for interpretability, code quality, and model size. 5. Compare with standard models lacking sociolinguistic adaptations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Software requirement specification written in a code-mixed context with politeness markers typical of a South Asian community. Expected Output: Generated code comments and variable names that respect the sociolinguistic nuances while producing syntactically valid and semantically accurate code.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If sociolinguistic feature integration impacts computational efficiency negatively, fallback involves simplifying features to the most impactful subset identified via ablation, or applying features during post-processing generation reranking instead of model adaptation."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that integrating sociolinguistic features directly into LLM adaptation will lead to improved interpretability and generalization in software engineering contexts requires stronger justification. The proposal should provide empirical or theoretical grounding that sociolinguistic nuances significantly influence code generation and documentation quality across diverse programming communities. Clarifying potential challenges, such as variability in sociolinguistic signal detection or their effect size on model performance, will strengthen this foundational premise and the overall soundness of the framework design. This will also help justify the methodological complexity added by sociolinguistic integration rather than simpler domain adaptation techniques without sociolinguistic awareness, which may already yield substantial gains in practice. Without this, the idea risks conceptual fragility and implementation challenges that could undermine impact and feasibility outcomes. Expanding theoretical motivation or preliminary data supporting these assumptions is recommended before full-scale development begins, to avoid costly iteration and scope creep later on. This should be addressed promptly to confirm the core rationale behind the novel sociolinguistic adaptation approach is valid and practical for the targeted software engineering applications, thereby enhancing both soundness and feasibility fundamentally.\n\n--- Suggested action: Include a dedicated analysis or pilot study evidencing the influence of sociolinguistic factors on code and documentation generation quality in the targeted domain, or cite and integrate findings from prior sociolinguistics and NLP studies supporting this assumption, preferably aligned with cross-cultural or multilingual software engineering contexts relevant to the use case examples given (such as code-mixed South Asian contexts). This will build a more rigorous foundation for method design and experimental validation strategies in following steps. Target Section: Problem_Statement, Proposed_Method."

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan outlines an ambitious pipeline involving dataset curation, feature extraction, modular LLM development, benchmarking, and comparison. However, it lacks detail on critical feasibility aspects: 1) The scalability and availability of sociolinguistically annotated datasets pertinent to programming and documentation contexts, given sociolinguistic annotation is costly and domain-specific. 2) Concrete evaluation metrics and benchmarks that can effectively measure interpretability, sociolinguistic fidelity, code quality, and model size trade-offs in a quantifiable way to demonstrate the framework's added value over standard baselines. 3) Potential computational overhead and engineering complexity introduced by modular architectures conditioned on sociolinguistic features, and how these will be mitigated or balanced with the fallback plans mentioned. 4) Clear definitions and methodologies for integration of cultural knowledge graphs and adaptive reasoning modules within the experiments, which are advanced components requiring careful validation themselves. Strengthening these aspects is essential to ensure the experimental plan is practically executable within typical research project constraints and convincingly demonstrates the hypothesized benefits. A staged prototyping approach with concrete milestones for each major component and clear success criteria will enhance feasibility and reduce risk.\n\n--- Suggested action: Expand the experimental plan to include preliminary data acquisition strategies, detailed evaluation protocols (including sociolinguistic-specific metrics), resource estimates, and risk mitigation plans tied to the fallback strategies. Incorporate pilot experiments or ablation studies early to identify the most impactful sociolinguistic features reducing complexity and guiding modular architecture design. Clearly articulate how interpretability and cultural adaptation will be objectively validated beyond anecdotal examples. This will ensure the experimental efforts are focused, scientifically rigorous, and feasible within a reasonable timeframe and computational budget. Target Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan."
