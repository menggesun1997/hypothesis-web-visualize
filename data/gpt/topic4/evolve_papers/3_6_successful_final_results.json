    "title": "Cross-Domain Transfer Learning of Graph-Based Anomaly Detectors from Cybersecurity to Linguistic Data",
    "Problem_Statement": "Anomaly detection models leveraging graph neural networks developed extensively in cybersecurity domains rarely transfer knowledge to linguistic anomaly detection, missing an opportunity to fill modality silos and leverage mature cyber data methodologies.",
    "Motivation": "This project explicitly exploits the hidden bridge of graph-based anomaly detection from cybersecurity and applies transfer learning paradigms to adapt these models to linguistic and code modalities relevant to LLM dataset security, addressing siloed development and modality isolation gaps.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a transfer learning pipeline where GNN anomaly detectors pretrained on cybersecurity-oriented code vulnerability graphs or network traffic graphs are adapted via domain-adversarial training and domain-specific graph augmentations to linguistic data graphs reflecting syntax, semantics, and discourse structures. This facilitates cross-domain knowledge reuse, improving detection of complex anomalies in linguistic data without requiring extensive labeled linguistic anomaly datasets.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Source large cybersecurity graph datasets with labeled anomalies. 2) Pretrain GNN anomaly detectors on these datasets. 3) Construct linguistic graphs from text and code data. 4) Adapt pretrained models with domain adaptation techniques to linguistic graphs. 5) Measure anomaly detection improvements against linguistic-only training and no-transfer baselines using AUC and precision-recall.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Linguistic graph data representing syntactic relationships with injected anomalous constructs. Expected Output: The transferred model achieves superior anomaly detection performance and robustness compared to models trained purely on linguistic data without pretraining.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct transfer fails, explore multi-task learning combining cybersecurity and linguistic anomaly tasks or develop intermediate modality bridging representations using meta-learning."

        "title": "Federated Cross-Domain Transfer Learning of Graph-Based Anomaly Detectors from Cybersecurity to Linguistic Data",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current anomaly detection models based on graph neural networks (GNNs) developed predominantly for cybersecurity applications rarely benefit linguistic anomaly detection tasks. This siloed modality development misses the opportunity to leverage mature cybersecurity anomaly detection techniques for linguistic and code data domains. Further, data privacy issues and heterogeneity across domains pose significant challenges for centralized transfer learning approaches, limiting real-world applicability and model generalization.",
        "Motivation": "Despite existing cross-domain transfer attempts, the novelty remains limited as models seldom exploit privacy-preserving collaborative learning over distributed, heterogeneous data sources. This project aims to bridge this gap by integrating federated learning (FL) principles with domain-adversarial transfer learning of GNN-based anomaly detectors, enabling decentralized, privacy-preserving, cross-domain knowledge transfer between cybersecurity and linguistic modalities. This approach not only breaks modality silos and enhances anomaly detection robustness but also addresses sensitive data constraints, offering a novel, scalable, and practically viable AI system for trustworthy anomaly detection.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a federated transfer learning framework where GNN anomaly detectors pretrained locally on cybersecurity graph datasets (e.g., vulnerability or network traffic graphs) participate in a federated learning system with linguistic domain clients representing syntax, semantic, and discourse graphs constructed from text and code corpora. Each client constructs linguistically grounded graphs using robust NLP pipelines including dependency parsers, semantic role labeling, and discourse parsing tools, ensuring high-quality, representative graph structures. Domain-adversarial training modules within each federated client align feature distributions to mitigate domain mismatch. Collaborative model aggregation preserves data privacy and enhances generalization. Additionally, we inject controlled anomalous constructs validated by linguistic experts to benchmark detection performance. This integration of federated learning with domain-adversarial GNN transfer is novel and addresses both the methodological and practical limitations in cross-domain anomaly detection.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Acquire large labeled cybersecurity graph datasets with documented anomalies (e.g., vulnerability datasets, network traffic graphs). 2) Pretrain GNN anomaly detectors on cybersecurity data locally. 3) Collect diverse linguistic corpora spanning text and code, and construct linguistic graphs using state-of-the-art NLP tools: dependency parsing (UDPipe, Stanford Parser), semantic role labeling (AllenNLP), and RST discourse parsing. 4) Develop and validate anomaly injection strategies by integrating syntactic and semantic anomalies with expert review to ensure realism and representativeness. 5) Deploy a federated learning setup with cybersecurity and multiple linguistic clients, each fine-tuning models using domain-adversarial loss to reduce domain shift. 6) Evaluate anomaly detection performance on held-out linguistic graphs with annotated anomalies, comparing against baselines trained solely on linguistic data and centralized transfer without federated learning, using metrics including AUC, precision, recall, and robustness measures. 7) Perform ablation studies on graph construction techniques, anomaly types, and federated aggregation methods to assess contributions and scalability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Linguistic graphs representing complex syntactic structures with carefully injected anomalies (e.g., unusual dependency relations, semantic inconsistencies) in a decentralized federated learning environment. Expected Output: The federated transfer-learning GNN model demonstrates statistically significant improvements in anomaly detection accuracy, precision, and recall compared to purely linguistic-only trained models and non-federated transfer baselines, while preserving privacy of sensitive datasets. Robustness tests show better detection of subtle and composite linguistic anomalies with lower false positive rates.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated learning integration shows limited gains or training instability, we will pivot to incorporating multi-task learning with cybersecurity and linguistic anomaly detection objectives in a centralized setting, augmented with meta-learning to generate bridging modality representations. Additionally, we will explore reinforcement learning-based graph augmentation strategies to improve domain adaptation robustness without federated constraints."

Without clear methodology on linguistic graph construction and annotation of anomalies, the feasibility of adapting pretrained GNN models effectively remains questionable. It is recommended to explicitly detail graph-building methods (e.g., parsers, semantic role labeling) and anomaly injection strategies to ensure reliable and reproducible experiments that convincingly validate transfer benefits over baselines, which is critical for practical success of this cross-domain transfer approach. Moreover, clarifying dataset sources and scale for the linguistic domain will strengthen feasibility arguments in the proposal's experimental plan section. This addition will also help address potential domain mismatch issues more concretely rather than only relying on proposed domain adaptation techniques, which could be brittle without solid data foundations in linguistic graphs.

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty screening result NOV-COMPETITIVE and the challenge of effective cross-domain transfer, the proposal could substantially enhance impact and distinctiveness by integrating federated learning (FL) principles for anomaly detection across cyber and linguistic domains. Incorporating federated learning can allow models to learn collaboratively and securely from distributed datasets in heterogeneous domains while preserving privacy and autonomy. This would address real-world deployment constraints (e.g., sensitive cyber data and proprietary linguistic corpora) and amplify the contribution by building a trustworthy and scalable AI system for cross-modality anomaly detection. This integration aligns well with graph data management and trustworthy machine learning cited in the linked concepts, making the research more novel and aligned with recent advances. Specifically, adapting the domain-adversarial training within a federated learning framework or agent-based system could enrich the proposed methodology and open new research directions.
