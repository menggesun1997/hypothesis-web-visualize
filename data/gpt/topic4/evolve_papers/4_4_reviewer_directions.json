    "title": "Hierarchical Multilingual Prompt Engineering Integrating Language Ecology for Software Tasks",
    "Problem_Statement": "Prompt engineering techniques for LLMs in software tasks do not systematically incorporate hierarchical linguistic context or language ecology factors, limiting adaptability and performance in high linguistic diversity contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses Critical Gap (1) and (3) by injecting linguistic ecological insights into prompt engineering, extending High-Potential Innovation Opportunity 2 in semantic pattern catalog expansion with a hierarchical linguistic-aware prompt design paradigm.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hierarchical prompt engineering framework that models language ecology (language contact, diglossia, code-switching) to dynamically generate multi-layered prompts tailored for software engineering tasks. It uses a meta-prompt controller that selects and composes prompt modules conditioned on detected linguistic context, supported by a multilingual semantic pattern catalog. The system is designed to leverage lightweight modules that reflect linguistic hierarchy from phonology to syntax impacting prompt phrasing and semantic augmentation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Compile codebench datasets with sociolinguistically annotated prompt inputs. 2. Build a library of linguistic ecology-informed prompt modules. 3. Train a meta-prompt controller using reinforcement learning optimizing for accuracy and robustness in multilingual code tasks. 4. Evaluate against baseline flat prompt engineering models. Metrics: task accuracy, prompt efficiency, adaptability across languages.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt in a creole-influenced code-mixed dialect asking for code snippet generation. Expected Output: Code generation reflecting creole influenced idiomatic expressions represented through hierarchical prompts.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If reinforcement learning optimization is unstable, fallback to supervised learning based on expert-crafted prompt compositions or heuristic rule-based linguistic context encoding for prompt selection."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that hierarchical linguistic context and language ecology can be systematically and effectively incorporated into prompt engineering for software tasks requires stronger empirical grounding. The proposal would benefit from clarifying evidence or preliminary studies indicating that such sociolinguistic factors materially impact prompt effectiveness in multilingual code generation contexts. Without this, the premise risks overestimating the role of language ecology relative to other factors influencing LLM performance on software tasks, potentially weakening the foundational rationale of the method. Recommend including references or preliminary data to support this assumption and explicitly delineating what aspects of language ecology are most impactful for prompt design in software engineering domains when using LLMs, to fortify the soundness of the problem framing and method design. This is essential before advancing to full system development and reinforcement learning optimization stages, ensuring the approach rests on validated premises rather than speculative linguistic theory application in an engineering context (Problem_Statement, Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The current step-by-step experimental plan, while comprehensive, depends heavily on compiling and annotating sociolinguistically rich codebench datasets and training a meta-prompt controller with reinforcement learning, which may pose substantial practical challenges. Collecting diverse, high-quality, and correctly sociolinguistically annotated datasets (especially for low-resource and code-mixed dialect scenarios) is a non-trivial task that demands detailed elaboration — how and from where such data will be obtained, annotated, and validated is unclear. Additionally, reinforcement learning for prompt selection controllers can be unstable and data-intensive; the fallback to supervised or heuristic methods should be described in detail with contingency plans for scalability and robustness. To enhance feasibility, provide a more detailed data acquisition and annotation strategy including resource requirements and timeline estimates, plus a preliminary experimental validation plan (e.g., smaller-scale proof of concept on synthetic or established datasets) before full reinforcement learning deployment. This will improve the scientific soundness and practical viability of the experimentation roadmap (Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment indicating a highly competitive area, the idea’s impact and novelty could be significantly enhanced by integrating concepts from 'automatic term extraction' and 'complex downstream tasks' within software engineering. Specifically, incorporating automatic term extraction techniques into the multilingual semantic pattern catalog could enrich the linguistic features used for prompt engineering, enabling more precise and domain-adapted prompt phrasing for software tasks. Moreover, broadening the scope to also address complex downstream software engineering tasks such as code comprehension, debugging, or testing could elevate impact by demonstrating wider applicability beyond code snippet generation. Combining these with the hierarchical language ecology modeling could position the work as a novel, comprehensive prompting framework that advances software engineering NLP tasks significantly beyond current flat multilingual prompts. This global integration approach will also help differentiate the research in a crowded field by leveraging well-established NLP methodologies and demonstrating broader utility (Proposed_Method, Test_Case_Examples)."
