    "title": "Integrated Moral Normativity Loss Function for Multilingual Bias Mitigation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing training pipelines lack an intrinsic, operational loss function that directly encodes moral normativity during multilingual LLM fine-tuning to prevent toxic or biased outputs effectively.",
    "Motivation": "Directly confronts the internal gap relating to operationalizing moral normativity within training by proposing a novel loss function informed by interdisciplinary ethical models to guide fair language representation learning during fine-tuning.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design and integrate into LLM training a differentiable moral normativity loss based on probabilistic ethical evaluations from psychological and health science theories. The loss penalizes model-generated texts divergent from fairness and ethical norms dynamically across languages, guiding the model toward equitable and safe outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Formalize moral normativity criteria from cross-disciplinary frameworks into computable metrics. 2) Implement the normativity loss function combining with language modeling objectives. 3) Fine-tune multilingual LLMs on diverse datasets with and without the loss. 4) Evaluate outputs for toxicity reduction, fairness across languages, and preservation of language fluency. 5) Conduct ablation studies of loss components.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Discuss social stereotypes about ethnicity.\" Output: Outputs tempered by the normativity loss function to avoid biased or toxic statements, reflecting moral constraints consistent across languages.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If the normativity loss impairs model fluency, try multi-objective optimization balancing normativity and language modeling losses. Alternatively, explore curriculum learning introducing the loss progressively."

        "title": "Normative-Framework-Integrated Moral Normativity Loss for Culturally and Legally Grounded Multilingual LLM Bias Mitigation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current multilingual LLM fine-tuning approaches lack a rigorously defined, computationally precise loss function that effectively encodes moral normativity by integrating global ethical, legal, and cultural dimensions, thus limiting the suppression of toxic or biased outputs in a universally respectful and legally compliant manner.",
        "Motivation": "While prior methods incorporate fairness heuristics or probabilistic ethical evaluations, they fall short of embedding a normative backbone grounded in internationally recognized ethical and legal principles. Addressing the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict, we propose a method that innovatively fuses interdisciplinary psychological ethics with formalized global human rights law and legal interpretative theory to create a sound, verifiable, and culturally adaptive moral normativity loss. This elevates multidisciplinary AI ethics integration, bridging technical AI fairness with normative legal frameworks and interactive ethical standards, which is critical for trustworthy, equitable multilingual AI applications across sociocultural and legal contexts worldwide.",
        "Proposed_Method": "1) Construct a hybrid normative framework combining cross-disciplinary ethical metrics derived from psychology and health sciences with codified international human rights law principles and legal theory of interpretation to define moral normativity criteria. 2) Operationalize these criteria into a differentiable loss function using a modular, multi-component scheme where: (i) probabilistic bias and toxicity measures are weighted by a legal-ethical compliance module encoding rights-based constraints via soft constraints derived from legal interpretation models, and (ii) culture-sensitive calibration layers adapt penalty weights per language and region using online language resources and comparative law metadata. 3) Integrate this loss function with existing language modeling objectives through a multi-objective optimization paradigm, balancing fluency, fairness, legal compliance, and moral normativity. 4) Embed mechanisms inspired by AI assistance and communicating agents to promote interactive ethical alignment by conditioning output policies on normative feedback signals during decoding, further mitigating unintended outputs. 5) Validate the normative loss's efficacy and soundness via formal verification methods aligned with legal interpretation techniques and empirical evaluation across multiple languages with diverse cultural and legal backgrounds.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collaborate with legal scholars and ethicists to formalize a set of universal and localized moral normativity criteria incorporating human rights law, legal theory of interpretation, and psychological ethics; 2) Develop computational models translating these criteria into weighted, differentiable penalty functions and verify their soundness through formal methods and preliminary synthetic data; 3) Implement the integrated moral normativity loss and combine it with language model objectives within a multilingual LLM fine-tuning pipeline; 4) Collect and curate multilingual datasets annotated for toxicity, bias, and legal-ethical compliance reflecting diverse cultural contexts; 5) Fine-tune multilingual LLMs using the proposed loss and baseline methods; 6) Evaluate models quantitatively on toxicity reduction, fairness, legal compliance, language fluency, and robustness; 7) Conduct ablation studies probing the contribution of legal, psychological, and cultural components; 8) Test interactive alignment features inspired by communicating agents on human-in-the-loop evaluation scenarios; 9) Analyze failure modes and iterate model calibration per region using online language resource feedback.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Discuss gender roles in family structures across different cultures.\" Output: A multilingual response that navigates cultural sensitivity by avoiding stereotypes and biased language, respects legal protections related to gender equality (e.g., under human rights law), while maintaining linguistic fluency and engaging content. The output dynamically adapts per language context, ensuring compliance with both universal and local legal and ethical norms, exemplifying interactive ethical alignment by smoothly rejecting or reframing potentially harmful user prompts.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the integrated normative loss overly restricts model expressivity and fluency, we will employ advanced multi-objective optimization techniques such as Pareto front modeling to balance trade-offs more finely. Additionally, progressive curriculum learning will be employed to introduce normative constraints gradually to the model. Should formal verification of the loss criteria prove intractable, we will pivot to data-driven, empirically validated proxy metrics drawing from curated multilingual corpora annotated via expert and crowdsourced legal-ethical judgments. Finally, if interactive ethical alignment is computationally intensive or unstable, a modular post-processing ethical filter layer based on legal norms and cultural calibrations will be developed as a last-resort mitigation mechanism."

However, the mechanism by which such interdisciplinary ethical theories from psychology and health sciences translate into precise, differentiable loss metrics is under-specified. Clarify the concrete computational formulation of these ethical constraints and how they are validated to reliably capture moral normativity without inducing unintended behavioral biases or overly constraining language generation. Detailing the theoretical and technical steps to bridge ethical theory to differentiable loss will significantly strengthen soundness and reproducibility of the method, especially across diverse languages and cultures where moral norms vary subtly but importantly. Providing example formulations or preliminary experiments on formalizing these criteria would be highly beneficial for assessing feasibility and validity of the core approach in Proposed_Method."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict of NOV-COMPETITIVE, the idea can benefit from deeper integration with globally-relevant legal and ethical frameworks. I suggest exploring a fusion of this moral normativity loss with principles from 'international human rights law' or 'legal theory of interpretation' to provide a well-founded normative backbone that can guide fair multilingual model behavior respecting universal rights and local sociocultural legal norms. Additionally, incorporating concepts from 'AI assistance' and 'communicating agents' to align the LLM's outputs with interactive ethical standards or legal compliance could broaden impact. This direction can move the work beyond purely empirical fairness metrics toward principled, cross-disciplinary AI ethics integration, elevating novelty and the scope of impact across AI applications in law, human-robot interaction, and multilingual communication."
