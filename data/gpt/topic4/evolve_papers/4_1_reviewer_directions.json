    "title": "Semantic Augmentation Catalog for Multilingual and Dialectal Programming Contexts",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing semantic augmentation catalogs for software engineering LLMs largely exclude multilingual and dialectal variations, impairing model robustness and applicability in highly linguistically diverse programming environments. This gap restricts cross-lingual code comprehension and generation.",
    "Motivation": "This project targets Critical Gap (1) and (3) around underrepresentation of linguistic diversity in semantic resources, exploiting High-Potential Innovation Opportunity 2 by systematically expanding catalogs with multilingual semantic patterns and dialect-specific augmentations.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose constructing an extensible multilingual semantic pattern catalog that captures language- and dialect-specific semantic augmentations for software engineering tasks. This catalog will be built by mining multimodal corpora (code + natural language comments) across diverse linguistic communities, utilizing unsupervised semantic clustering and cross-lingual embedding alignment to discover latent semantic variants and idiomatic code expressions influenced by local languages. Integration plugins will allow LLMs to dynamically query and apply these patterns during prompt engineering and execution.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate multilingual and dialectal datasets from open-source repositories and localized coding communities. 2. Develop unsupervised semantic pattern detection algorithms using multilingual embeddings (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R). 3. Create a structured catalog format incorporating linguistic metadata. 4. Integrate catalog querying mechanisms into prompt engineering pipelines. 5. Evaluate impact on multilingual code generation quality and robustness comparing baseline augmentation without the catalog.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Code snippet and comment in Spanish-Andalusian dialect requesting bug fixes. Expected Output: Code suggestions that reflect dialect-influenced semantic patterns in comments and idiomatic variable naming conventions.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If unsupervised pattern extraction proves noisy, fallback to a semi-supervised approach leveraging linguist-annotated semantic patterns and community-driven annotation campaigns to refine the catalog quality. Alternatively, develop a simpler rule-based pattern extraction for initial deployment."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan hinges critically on curating multilingual and dialectal datasets from open-source repositories and localized coding communities, which may be challenging due to data scarcity, inconsistent dialect labeling, and variable code-comment quality. To strengthen feasibility, you should explicitly detail criteria and methods for dataset selection, quality control, and dialect annotation, as well as validate that sufficient data volume and diversity exist. Additionally, the reliance on unsupervised semantic pattern detection presumes clustering and cross-lingual embedding alignment will cleanly extract dialect-specific semantic variants; thus, including pilot quantitative or qualitative validation studies would improve confidence. Without these clarifications and fallback quantifications, the experimental approach risks practical delays or noisy results, undermining the project's feasibility and credibility. Consider integrating community-based collection methods or partial semi-supervised steps earlier if unsupervised approaches show early signs of instability or data sparsity issues.  This feedback targets the Experiment_Plan section with the goal of improving project viability and scientific rigor in the experimentation pipeline."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the idea's novelty screening result of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the identified multilingual semantic augmentation context, a concrete enhancement is to integrate your semantic augmentation catalog with ongoing initiatives in language equality and low-resource languages, especially leveraging insights from natural language understanding and digital humanities. For instance, you could expand the catalog's multilingualism scope by including dialects and code contexts relevant to low-resource languages highlighted in fact-checking efforts or automatic speech recognition communities. This cross-domain expansion could significantly boost impact by addressing broader linguistic digital divides and foster applications beyond software engineering, such as multilingual content moderation or educational technology. Additionally, aligning your catalog with critical digital literacies frameworks might allow societal impact in reducing language bias and supporting diverse programmer communities globally. Including an explicit plan to liaise with these ecosystems or datasets widens impact and fortifies the novelty claim beyond a narrowly scoped software engineering LLM augmentation."
