    "Problem_Statement": "Standard multilingual training treats languages uniformly or clusters them by language family, ignoring fine-grained typological differences that could optimize transfer and reduce negative transfer effects.",
    "Motivation": "Targets internal gaps on typology integration in transfer learning to improve model generalization and bias, moving beyond English-centric and family-based clustering approaches.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a curriculum learning strategy that dynamically organizes training batches based on sliding typological similarity measures, such as word order, morphological complexity, and phonological inventories. The curriculum guides model focus from close typological neighbors to more distant languages progressively, improving robustness and typology-aware representation learning.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Extract typological feature vectors for languages from WALS and URIEL; 2) Define typology distance functions; 3) Construct training curricula reflecting incremental typological divergence; 4) Train multilingual transformers on token-level language modeling and downstream tasks; 5) Compare to random, family-based, and no-curriculum baselines; 6) Evaluate performance, representation diversity, and bias metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Training sequence starts with Spanish, Italian (close to English typology), then progressively includes more distant languages like Basque and Georgian. Expected Output: Improved cross-lingual transfer performance on distant languages, reduced bias on typologically unique constructs.",

        "title": "Typology-Guided Multilingual Curriculum Learning with Empirical Validation and Robust Evaluation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing multilingual training strategies typically treat languages homogeneously or cluster them by language family, often overlooking the role of fine-grained typological differences in optimizing cross-lingual transfer. The fundamental assumption that typological divergences—captured via features such as word order, morphological complexity, and phonological inventories—systematically influence transfer learning remains under-explored and insufficiently justified in literature. Moreover, it is unclear which typological dimensions most strongly affect neural representation learning or whether certain features contribute noise. Addressing this gap requires a rigorous theoretical and empirical grounding to validate typological distance as a reliable basis for curriculum learning and to ensure that such curricula outperform or complement family-based clustering and random curricula in multilingual transformers.",
        "Motivation": "This work aims to advance the field beyond English-centric and language-family-based approaches by explicitly validating and leveraging typological features that contribute meaningfully to cross-lingual transfer. By systematically analyzing the predictive power of individual and combined typological features on model transfer gains, our approach justifies and refines curriculum design theoretically and empirically. Our method uniquely integrates these insights into a dynamic curriculum learning framework that mirrors second language acquisition theories—progressing from typologically close languages to more distant ones—to enhance model generalization, representation robustness, and fairness, including mitigating bias toward typologically unique languages. This addresses internal gaps in typology integration, grounding our approach in linguistic typology, cognitive learning principles, and recent advances in fairness evaluation for NLP.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a three-fold method: (1) Robust Empirical Typology-Transfer Analysis: Employ large-scale preliminary experiments across a diverse set of 40+ typologically and script-diverse languages, extracting and evaluating typological feature vectors from WALS and URIEL datasets. We will quantify the correlation and predictive power of typological distances computed separately for syntactic (e.g., word order), morphological, and phonological features against observed zero-shot and few-shot transfer learning gains in pretrained multilingual transformers. This phase establishes the valid features and distance functions to inform curriculum design. (2) Typology-Guided Curriculum Learning: Utilizing the validated typological distance metric, we design a dynamic curriculum that gradually advances from languages most typologically similar to English (or a specified pivot) toward more distant languages. Training sequences follow incremental typological distance thresholds with tunable step granularity, inspired by second language acquisition paradigms emphasizing scaffolded exposure for cognitive and socio-emotional learning efficacy. (3) Fairness and Bias-Aware Evaluation: To address biases towards typologically unique languages, we include auxiliary tasks in the curriculum that explicitly predict typological attributes from representations and enforce contrastive losses to emphasize typological distinctions. This is augmented by metrics specifically designed to measure performance on typologically rare linguistic constructs (e.g., ergativity, click consonants), quantifying fairness and representation diversity. Integration of socio-emotional processing theories informs curriculum pacing to optimize model adaptability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset and Languages: Select 40+ languages covering broad typological, morphological, phonological, and script diversity from WALS/URIEL (e.g., Romance, Turkic, Basque, Georgian, Niger-Congo, Austronesian). 2) Typological Feature Extraction: Obtain subspace vectors for syntax, morphology, phonology; compute multiple typological distance functions (cosine, Euclidean). 3) Preliminary Transfer Correlation Analysis: Finetune multilingual transformers on initial languages; measure zero-shot/few-shot downstream task transfer to others; statistically analyze correlations between typological distances and transfer gains per feature set. 4) Curriculum Construction: Define curriculum stages using empirically validated distance thresholds with defined step sizes (e.g., increments of 0.1 in normalized typological distance), creating progressive training batches. 5) Baselines: Train models with (a) no curriculum (random language sampling), (b) family-based clustering curricula, and (c) pretrained multilingual models with standard fine-tuning. 6) Curriculum Training: Train models on token-level language modeling and relevant downstream NLP tasks (e.g., POS tagging, NER). 7) Bias and Fairness Evaluation: Compute metrics such as functional accuracy on typologically unique constructs, disparity indices across language types, and embedding representation diversity metrics. 8) Ablation Studies: Test auxiliary typology prediction tasks and contrastive losses with curriculum vs. without to isolate effects. 9) Resources and Feasibility: Detail compute (e.g., GPU hours) and model sizes to ensure practical feasibility, reporting training time and convergence behavior to encourage replicability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A training curriculum starting with Spanish, Italian, and Romanian (typologically close syntactically and morphologically to English) progressing in defined steps to Basque (ergative, non-Indo-European), Georgian (rich morphology), and Xhosa (click consonants, Bantu family). Expected Output: Compared to baseline curricula, models trained with the typology-guided curriculum achieve statistically significant gains in zero-shot and few-shot transfer on typologically distant languages, demonstrated by higher accuracy on POS tagging and NER tasks. Performance disparities between typologically unique and mainstream languages reduce, indicating improved fairness and bias mitigation. Auxiliary typology prediction tasks show improved typology-informed representation learning, and ablations confirm the necessity of curriculum pacing. Phenomena such as improved handling of rare morphological and phonological constructs evidence enhanced representation diversity and generalization.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If typology-guided curricula provide only marginal gains, we will pivot to integrate multi-task learning frameworks leveraging auxiliary typology prediction losses and contrastive learning objectives that emphasize typological distinctions within model representations. Additionally, we will explore adaptive curriculum pacing inspired by cognitive and socio-emotional processing from second language acquisition literature to enhance learning dynamics. If computational constraints limit scaling, smaller subsets of languages and task-specific fine-tuning will be conducted to isolate model improvements attributable to typology. Finally, incorporation of public health domain NLP tasks will be explored to broaden impact and applicability, leveraging the model's advanced handling of typologically diverse languages in health promotion texts across cultures."

          "feedback_content": "The fundamental assumption that fine-grained typological differences, beyond family-based clustering, provide consistent and significant benefits in multilingual transfer learning merits stronger theoretical justification or empirical precedent. While typology-informed curricula are intuitively promising, it remains unclear whether the chosen typological features (word order, morphology, phonology) equally impact neural representation learning or if some may introduce noise. Clarifying and supporting these assumptions with citations or pilot analyses will strengthen the soundness of the proposed approach and reduce risk of chasing spurious or marginal effects inherent in typological distances that are not strongly predictive of transfer interactions in deep models today. Consider explicitly discussing the robustness and validity of typology distance metrics vis-à-vis transfer gains in prior work or preliminary experiments to reinforce this assumption beyond the current intuition-based framing. This is critical because the entire methodology and curriculum hinge on the quality and predictive value of these typological distances and their effect on model learning dynamics.  Addressing this will increase confidence that the problem is well-posed and the method is justified as a novel improvement over language-family or random curricula.

For feasibility and impact, it is essential to clarify critical aspects such as: (1) the size and diversity of the language set (number of languages, typological and script diversity) to ensure meaningful evaluation of gradual typological divergence; (2) the schedule and granularity of curriculum progression (step sizes or thresholds in typological distance that define curriculum stages); (3) concrete baselines including strong multilingual pretrained models with fine-tuning, family clusters, and random curriculum schedules; (4) metrics quantifying bias and fairness, their definitions, and how typologically unique constructs are operationalized and measured quantitatively; (5) computational resources and time estimates to evaluate feasibility on realistic multilingual transformer scales. Providing these details will ensure the experiments are practical, scientifically sound, and yield interpretable results, enabling clear attribution of performance gains or failures to the curriculum methodology rather than confounds. Without this, it is difficult to assess feasibility and replicability, which could impede the work’s acceptance and adoption. Target Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan."
