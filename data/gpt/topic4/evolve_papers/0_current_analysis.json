On opportunities and challenges of large language models for education', 'abstract': 'Large language models represent a significant advancement in the field of AI. The underlying technology is key to further innovations and, despite critical views and even bans within communities and regions, large language models are here to stay. This commentary presents the potential benefits and challenges of educational applications of large language models, from student and teacher perspectives. We briefly discuss the current state of large language models and their applications. We then highlight how these models can be used to create educational content, improve student engagement and interaction, and personalize learning experiences. With regard to challenges, we argue that large language models in education require teachers and learners to develop sets of competencies and literacies necessary to both understand the technology as well as their limitations and unexpected brittleness of such systems. In addition, a clear strategy within educational systems and a clear pedagogical approach with a strong focus on critical thinking and strategies for fact checking are required to integrate and take full advantage of large language models in learning settings and teaching curricula. Other challenges such as the potential bias in the output, the need for continuous human oversight, and the potential for misuse are not unique to the application of AI in education. But we believe that, if handled sensibly, these challenges can offer insights and opportunities in education scenarios to acquaint students early on with potential societal biases, criticalities, and risks of AI applications. We conclude with recommendations for how to address these challenges and ensure that such models are used in a responsible and ethical manner in education.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Collaborating With ChatGPT: Considering the Implications of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Journalism and Media Education', 'abstract': 'Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is ushering in an era of potential transformation of journalism and media content. This essay considers one notable generative AI platform called ChatGPT made available to the public in 2022 for free use. ChatGPT allows users to enter text prompts and rapidly generates text responses drawn from its knowledge acquired via machine learning in engagement with the internet. This essay is coauthored by a human journalism and media professor in collaboration with ChatGPT. The essay demonstrates the capacity and limitations of ChatGPT and offers reflections on the implications of generative AI for journalism and media education.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'The Digital Divide: Addressing Artificial Intelligence in Communication Education', 'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained both momentum and importance within society over the past several years. This article provides an opening for further discussion to the broader social and digital media research community and those interested in answering important questions related to these areas by leveraging a focused, productive approach. In supporting future educational endeavors within the communication classroom, and specifically to this topic, we propose five important considerations that will move the conversation forward. The considerations within this article are meant to engage scholars in intellectual conversation and to provide an initial foundation for the direction of communication education. They are not meant to be an exhaustive list, but rather initiate discussions within education and research addressing implications emerging technologies have had on our field and what could be incorporated into the media and communication curriculum to prepare educators and students alike.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Automatic Generation of Programming Exercises and Code Explanations Using Large Language Models', 'abstract': 'This article explores the natural language generation capabilities of large language models with application to the production of two types of learning resources common in programming courses. Using OpenAI Codex as the large language model, we create programming exercises (including sample solutions and test cases) and code explanations, assessing these qualitatively and quantitatively. Our results suggest that the majority of the automatically generated content is both novel and sensible, and in some cases ready to use as is. When creating exercises we find that it is remarkably easy to influence both the programming concepts and the contextual themes they contain, simply by supplying keywords as input to the model. Our analysis suggests that there is significant value in massive generative machine learning models as a tool for instructors, although there remains a need for some oversight to ensure the quality of the generated content before it is delivered to students. We further discuss the implications of OpenAI Codex and similar tools for introductory programming education and highlight future research streams that have the potential to improve the quality of the educational experience for both teachers and students alike.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Large pre-trained language models contain human-like biases of what is right and wrong to do', 'abstract': 'Artificial writing is permeating our lives due to recent advances in large-scale, transformer-based language models (LMs) such as BERT, GPT-2 and GPT-3. Using them as pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art for many natural language processing tasks and shown that they capture not only linguistic knowledge but also retain general knowledge implicitly present in the data. Unfortunately, LMs trained on unfiltered text corpora suffer from degenerated and biased behaviour. While this is well established, we show here that recent LMs also contain human-like biases of what is right and wrong to do, reflecting existing ethical and moral norms of society. We show that these norms can be captured geometrically by a ‘moral direction’ which can be computed, for example, by a PCA, in the embedding space. The computed ‘moral direction’ can rate the normativity (or non-normativity) of arbitrary phrases without explicitly training the LM for this task, reflecting social norms well. We demonstrate that computing the ’moral direction’ can provide a path for attenuating or even preventing toxic degeneration in LMs, showcasing this capability on the RealToxicityPrompts testbed.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'A neural network solves, explains, and generates university math problems by program synthesis and few-shot learning at human level', 'abstract': \"We demonstrate that a neural network pretrained on text and fine-tuned on code solves mathematics course problems, explains solutions, and generates questions at a human level. We automatically synthesize programs using few-shot learning and OpenAI's Codex transformer and execute them to solve course problems at 81% automatic accuracy. We curate a dataset of questions from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s largest mathematics courses (Single Variable and Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, Introduction to Probability and Statistics, Linear Algebra, and Mathematics for Computer Science) and Columbia University's Computational Linear Algebra. We solve questions from a MATH dataset (on Prealgebra, Algebra, Counting and Probability, Intermediate Algebra, Number Theory, and Precalculus), the latest benchmark of advanced mathematics problems designed to assess mathematical reasoning. We randomly sample questions and generate solutions with multiple modalities, including numbers, equations, and plots. The latest GPT-3 language model pretrained on text automatically solves only 18.8% of these university questions using zero-shot learning and 30.8% using few-shot learning and the most recent chain of thought prompting. In contrast, program synthesis with few-shot learning using Codex fine-tuned on code generates programs that automatically solve 81% of these questions. Our approach improves the previous state-of-the-art automatic solution accuracy on the benchmark topics from 8.8 to 81.1%. We perform a survey to evaluate the quality and difficulty of generated questions. This work automatically solves university-level mathematics course questions at a human level and explains and generates university-level mathematics course questions at scale, a milestone for higher education.\"}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': '“So what if ChatGPT wrote it?” Multidisciplinary perspectives on opportunities, challenges and implications of generative conversational AI for research, practice and policy', 'abstract': 'Transformative artificially intelligent tools, such as ChatGPT, designed to generate sophisticated text indistinguishable from that produced by a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'ChatGPT is fun, but not an author', 'abstract': 'In less than 2 months, the artificial intelligence (AI) program ChatGPT has become a cultural sensation. It is freely accessible through a web portal created by the tool\\'s developer, OpenAI. The program-which automatically creates text based on written prompts-is so popular that it\\'s likely to be \"at capacity right now\" if you attempt to use it. When you do get through, ChatGPT provides endless entertainment. I asked it to rewrite the first scene of the classic American play <i>Death of a Salesman</i>, but to feature Princess Elsa from the animated movie <i>Frozen</i> as the main character instead of Willy Loman. The output was an amusing conversation in which Elsa-who has come home from a tough day of selling-is told by her son Happy, \"Come on, Mom. You\\'re Elsa from <i>Frozen</i>. You have ice powers and you\\'re a queen. You\\'re unstoppable.\" Mash-ups like this are certainly fun, but there are serious implications for generative AI programs like ChatGPT in science and academia.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'ChatGPT for (Finance) research: The Bananarama Conjecture', 'abstract': 'We show, based on ratings by finance journal reviewers of generated output, that the recently released AI chatbot ChatGPT can significantly assist with finance research. In principle, these results should be generalisable across research domains. There are clear advantages for idea generation and data identification. The technology, however, is weaker on literature synthesis and developing appropriate testing frameworks. Importantly, we further demonstrate that the extent of private data and researcher domain expertise input, are key factors in determining the quality of output. We conclude by considering the implications, particularly the ethical implications, which arise from this new technology.'}]\n```\n\n**Part A.2: The Evolution Links (Edges of the Graph):**\nThe following list defines the citation relationships between the papers in Part A.

The report **MUST** contain ONLY the following three sections:\n\n**1. Current Research Landscape & Core Consensus:**\n- What is the central problem and dominant methodology of the **current** state-of-the-art? Your summary should reflect the insights from the evolutionary analysis (e.g., 'the current focus on X is a direct response to the limitations of the earlier Y').\n- Use the Central Nodes (B.1) and Thematic Islands (B.2) to support your summary.\n\n**2. Critical Gaps & Unexplored Frontiers:**\n- **Internal Gaps:** What limitations are present in the recent papers? What weaknesses are revealed by the overall evolutionary trajectory (e.g., 'the field has consistently overlooked problem Z throughout its evolution')?\n- **External/Novel Gaps:** Based on the Global Context (Part C), what novel connections or cross-disciplinary approaches have been overlooked?\n\n**3. High-Potential Innovation Opportunities:**\n- Based on the identified gaps, propose 2-3 high-level, innovative research directions.\n- Each opportunity should be justified by linking a Global Opportunity (from Part C) with a problem or limitation identified in your analysis.\n",

    "title": "Landscape Map for Multilingual Performance Evaluation of Large Language Models Across Underrepresented Languages",
    "current_research_landscape": "The current state-of-the-art research in large language models (LLMs) prominently centers on transformer-based architectures and pre-trained models such as ChatGPT, emphasizing their deployment as conversational agents and tools for various language processing tasks including few-shot learning and program synthesis. This focus has emerged primarily as a response to earlier limitations in natural language understanding, scalability, and human-AI interaction efficacy. Central themes include enhancing human-AI collaboration, personalized learning experiences, and leveraging generative artificial intelligence for digital transformation across industries such as education, journalism, and finance. The research trajectory shows a consolidation around transformer-based models to address complex language tasks, alongside ethical considerations around bias, fairness, and safety. Notably, conceptual clusters highlight efforts around conversational agents (e.g., ChatGPT), personalized education, generative AI impacts, and digital transformation of organizations, reinforcing that current methodologies prioritise versatility, interactivity, and domain adaptation within well-resourced languages and contexts.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps within the field include a persistent under-exploration of multilingual performance, specifically for underrepresented and low-resource languages, despite advances in transformer pre-training. Most evolutionary research has emphasized English or high-resource languages, resulting in a digital divide and reduced applicability of LLMs for many global communities. Ethical and bias concerns have been identified but predominantly in the context of dominant languages, leaving gaps in culturally and linguistically diverse inclusivity. Further, while few-shot learning and program synthesis have advanced significantly, their efficacy in underrepresented languages remains largely untested or unsupported. External gaps revealed by the global context analysis indicate overlooked cross-disciplinary opportunities such as integrating multilingual pre-trained models into personalized educational technologies, leveraging knowledge graph methods to enrich underrepresented language contexts, and applying state-of-the-art multilingual transformer architectures to digital transformation scenarios in diverse socio-economic settings. Moreover, the convergence between transformer-based models and entertainment or conversational AI across cultural boundaries suggests neglected potential for improving engagement in marginalized language communities.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "1. Development of Multilingual Pre-trained Transformer Frameworks Tailored for Underrepresented Languages: Inspired by global co-concepts around multilingual models and NLP, this direction addresses the internal gap of limited language diversity by creating large-scale, culturally-sensitive pre-trained models. Incorporating knowledge graph approaches and few-shot learning can enhance performance and ethical reliability in low-resource settings.\n\n2. Cross-disciplinary Integration of Personalized Learning Systems with Multilingual Generative AI: Leveraging global findings on personalized learning, immersive conversational agents, and digital transformation, this opportunity uses transformer models to create adaptive educational content and tutoring systems that serve learners in underrepresented languages, helping to reduce the digital divide in education.\n\n3. Ethical and Bias-Aware Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarks for Multilingual LLMs: Building on known biases and moral norm embedding within models, a systematic creation of evaluation benchmarks focused on ethical, cultural, and linguistic fairness is critical. This includes combining state-of-the-art transformer capabilities with transparent moral direction techniques to assess and mitigate biases across diverse languages and domains."
