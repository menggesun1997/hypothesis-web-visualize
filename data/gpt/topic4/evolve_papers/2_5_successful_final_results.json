        "title": "Ethically Guided Few-Shot Prompting for Low-Resource Language Fairness with Adaptive Human-In-The-Loop Feedback",
        "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of practical, reproducible approaches enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to adaptively mitigate bias and promote fairness in low-resource languages using minimal annotated data, while accounting for the complexity and diversity of ethical standards across cultures.",
        "Motivation": "Existing few-shot prompting methods for bias mitigation either lack clarity in operationalizing cross-disciplinary ethical principles or rely on retraining approaches that are often infeasible in low-resource settings. Our proposal advances the field by rigorously formalizing an ethically-guided prompting framework that is context-adaptive, transparent, and human-in-the-loop integrated for iterative alignment with local fairness norms, thereby addressing the critical gap of trustworthy, practical bias mitigation tailored to data-scarce languages. By incorporating federated learning concepts and human evaluation protocols sensitive to cultural nuances, this work differentiates itself with a comprehensive, scalable approach to ethical AI adaptation across diverse linguistic contexts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-component methodology combining (1) a formalized prompt construction pipeline that encodes ethically grounded normativity principles extracted from interdisciplinary sources (health sciences, psychology, and cross-cultural ethics) into modular few-shot demonstrations tailored per language, (2) an adaptive context-aware prompt tuning mechanism leveraging parameter-efficient prompt tuning techniques to refine bias mitigation signals iteratively without full model retraining, and (3) a human-in-the-loop evaluation and feedback system incorporating local cultural experts to validate and adjust prompts in a reinforcement-learning-like feedback loop. This approach ensures alignment of LLM outputs with fairness constraints by explicitly modeling ambiguous and conflicting ethical principles using weighted prompt prototype vectors representing diverse cultural facets. Furthermore, inspired by federated learning, prompt updates from different language communities remain decentralized to respect data privacy while enabling cross-lingual knowledge transfer. This explicit and replicable pipeline includes transparent tracking of prompt generation steps, bias mitigation feedback metrics, and prompt adaptation logs. Together, these mechanisms produce robust, culturally sensitive, and reproducible fairness mitigation in low-resource languages solely through prompt engineering enhanced with human-robot interaction paradigms for continual ethical alignment.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate a cross-disciplinary, multilingual ethical knowledge base emphasizing low-resource languages by synthesizing normative principles from health sciences, psychology, and local sociocultural experts, including resolving conflicting norms with explicit weighting schemas. 2) Design an automated pipeline for constructing ethically guided few-shot prompts embedding these principles, employing modular prompt templates adaptable per language context. 3) Select a diverse set of typologically and geographically distinct low-resource languages (e.g., Wolof, Quechua, and Khmer) with varying data scarcity thresholds to test generalizability. 4) Implement parameter-efficient prompt tuning methods to iteratively refine prompt sets via human-in-the-loop feedback cycles elicited from native speakers and cultural experts. 5) Evaluate using multilingual fairness benchmarks extended with culturally contextualized bias metrics (e.g., fairness definitions sensitive to local norms), supplemented by systematic human evaluation protocols designed to capture nuanced perceptions of fairness and inclusivity. 6) Conduct error analysis and ablation studies distinguishing the impact of prompt design, tuning, and human feedback iterations, including fallback mechanisms activating parameter-efficient adapter tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback where pure prompting proves unstable. 7) Ensure reproducibility by releasing anonymized prompt generation artifacts, code, language-specific ethical knowledge mappings, detailed experimental protocols, and human evaluation guidelines.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt including culturally adapted few-shot examples embedding weighted ethical norms, plus the input \"Generate customer service response to a complaint alleging bias.\" Output: A polite, empathetic, and unbiased response reflecting local cultural fairness standards such as indirectness in communication (e.g., in Khmer) or community-oriented framing (e.g., in Quechua). Additionally, iterative outputs after human expert feedback refine responses to better align with emergent ethical insights. Comparative example shows non-adapted prompt yielding generic or culturally tone-deaf replies.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If prompt-only interventions yield inconsistent bias mitigation or divergent outputs, we will integrate parameter-efficient adapter tuning techniques that leverage the ethically guided prompt prototypes as initializations, thereby minimizing required data and compute resources. Additionally, we will develop reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) controllers using human-robot interaction frameworks, where feedback from cultural experts guides fine-grained policy updates refining fairness adherence. These fallback strategies maintain minimal retraining demands while providing robustness. We will systematically monitor performance to revert to fallback plans upon detecting instability, ensuring trustworthy deployment in sensitive scenarios."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes a prompt generation system embedding ethical principles into few-shot demonstrations for self-regulation by LLMs. However, the mechanism lacks clarity on how moral normativity from disparate fields (health sciences, psychology) will be operationalized concretely within prompts, and how the system ensures alignment with fairness constraints without retraining. Providing a detailed formalization or example pipeline illustrating prompt construction, context adaptation per language, and the feedback loop controlling bias mitigation would strengthen soundness significantly. Clarifying this is critical for assessing the method's validity and reproducibility in low-resource contexts where cultural fairness norms may diverge substantially from training data distributions. Consider explicitly addressing how ambiguous or conflicting ethical principles are reconciled within prompts to avoid inconsistent model behavior or harm in deployment contexts. This is essential to establish trustworthiness in self-regulation via prompting alone, especially since fallback plans admit pure prompting may be unstable, underscoring the method’s current incompleteness in soundness and rigor."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines testing on multilingual fairness benchmarks and prompt generalization across languages and domains, which is a powerful evaluation framework. However, it lacks specifics on the chosen benchmarks’ suitability for low-resource languages, metrics to quantify fairness and bias mitigation, and protocols for human evaluation aligning with local cultural norms. Given the complexity of ethical principles across cultures, empirical feasibility demands a concrete plan for gathering or validating cross-disciplinary ethical knowledge, prompt annotation, and systematic error analysis—including fallback interventions if prompting alone fails. Clarify criteria for selecting target languages (e.g., typological diversity, data scarcity thresholds) and how to ensure reproducibility of the ethical prompting framework. Adding iterative human-in-the-loop feedback cycles or case studies will further bolster experimental robustness. Without these details, feasibility risks being overly optimistic given known challenges in aligning LLMs for fairness in multilingual, low-resource setups."
