    "title": "Typology-Infused Prompt Tuning for Low-Resource Languages",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current multilingual large language models (LLMs) inadequately incorporate deep linguistic typological features, especially for typologically distant low-resource languages, limiting their performance and diversity representation.",
    "Motivation": "This project addresses the internal critical gap of insufficient integration of linguistic typology beyond family-based transfer, explicitly targeting non-Indo-European languages with unique morphosyntactic traits.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a Typology-Infused Prompt Tuning (TIPT) framework where typological features (e.g., morphological richness indices, dominant word orders) are encoded into continuous prompts that guide frozen LLMs during fine-tuning on downstream tasks. This modular approach injects typological inductive biases directly into models without requiring full retraining, enhancing adaptability to typologically diverse languages.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect typological feature data from WALS for a diverse set of languages including low-resource ones; 2) Pre-encode these features as continuous prompt vectors; 3) Apply TIPT on pre-trained multilingual models like XLM-R during fine-tuning on sentiment analysis and NER tasks for typologically distant languages; 4) Baselines are vanilla fine-tuning and adapter-based methods; 5) Evaluate with accuracy, F1 scores, and cross-lingual transferability measures; 6) Analyze representation diversity improvements via probing.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentiment classification in a low-resource Niger-Congo language, with the prompt incorporating morphological complexity and SVO order typological vectors. Expected output: Enhanced sentiment prediction accuracy compared to baseline, showing better recognition of morphological variants.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If prompt tuning yields limited gains, incorporate typological features as adapter layers augmenting the transformer architecture, or experiment with multitask learning with typology prediction tasks to reinforce feature integration."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-MECHANISM",
          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method's mechanism—encoding typological features as continuous prompts guiding frozen LLMs during fine-tuning—needs clearer details about how typological features are precisely encoded, integrated, and influence model predictions. For example, what form do the continuous prompts take, how are morphological richness indices operationalized in prompt space, and how does TIPT differ mechanistically and performance-wise from existing prompt tuning or adapter techniques? Without such clarification, the claim of effectively injecting typological biases risks being speculative. Enhancing methodological transparency will strengthen soundness and reproducibility prospects, enabling clearer mechanistic validation in ablation studies or visualization analyses, thereby reinforcing theoretical rigor and empirical trustworthiness in the approach's novelty and contributions. This is critical for convincing reviewers and practitioners alike of the approach's viability and distinctiveness within a field with strong existing methods integrating typology and transfer learning in multilingual NLP models. Please substantially expand and concretize the technical description of TIPT's inner workings and operational workflow within the Proposed_Method section, ensuring unambiguous articulation of algorithmic steps and model architecture modifications if any, supported by conceptual diagrams or pseudocode if possible. This effort will clarify connections to prior work and guide experimental validation strategies effectively.  Targeted improvements here will raise confidence in the idea's soundness and novelty claims moving forward from the initial screening stage where the research lies in a competitive area with strong prior art linkage.  Otherwise, reviewers may find the presented method too abstract or underexplored for confirming its claimed benefits or for confident adoption by the research community or application deployments in low-resource languages with unique typological traits as envisioned by the project.  Consider including concrete examples of prompt vectors or features during downstream tasks to substantiate operational feasibility and interpretability of TIPT's approach as well.  This represents the critical foundational issue to address ahead of additional experiment plan execution or impact validation efforts, as method clarity directly supports downstream reliability and interpretability of experimental results and impact assessments anticipated in the proposal.  A robust and well-articulated mechanism is fundamental before the project can move confidently toward experimentation and broader impact exploration phases effectively.  Therefore, addressing this feedback is the highest priority to enhance the technical soundness and persuasive power of the proposal overall.  Thank you for your consideration in strengthening this aspect substantially, which will elevate the overall presentation and impact of this promising approach targeting typologically diverse low-resource language challenges comprehensively and transparently for the field's benefit.  Please revise the Proposed_Method section accordingly with expanded, detailed technical explanations consistent with state-of-the-art multilingual modeling knowledge and prompt tuning paradigms, including typological feature integration nuances accordingly for maximal clarity and methodological rigor.  This revision will crucially anchor the project's theoretical soundness and practical feasibility foundations clearly for reviewers and practitioners alike."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "To enhance novelty and broader impact beyond incremental improvements in low-resource NLP tasks, we suggest integrating insights from 'language acquisition' and 'language education' fields to design TIPT prompts that model language learner internalization processes or typical acquisition stages of morphosyntactic features in low-resource, typologically distant languages. For instance, coupling typological prompt tuning with representations inspired by early language development or communicative language teaching techniques might enable the model to better simulate realistic language use scenarios encountered by children or language learners acquiring rare languages. Furthermore, exploring synergies with corpus linguistic methods to obtain richer, more varied typological and usage-based features for prompt encoding could augment TIPT's effectiveness and interpretability. This integration could highlight not just improved task performance but also advance interdisciplinary understanding of language development and pedagogy, thereby positioning the research at an innovative intersection linking NLP, linguistics, and educational technology. Such a direction might also tap into underexplored 'knowledge production' and 'discipline of linguistics' themes, fostering collaboration opportunities and raising the work's profile beyond traditional NLP venues. Including these globally-linked concepts thoughtfully in motivation, methods, and experiment design could elevate the research from 'novel combination in a competitive area' to a more transformative approach with wider scholarly and societal impact, addressing foundational questions about the representation and computational modeling of typologically rich languages and their acquisition."
