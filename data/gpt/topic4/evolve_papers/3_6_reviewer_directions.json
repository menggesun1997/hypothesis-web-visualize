    "title": "Cross-Domain Transfer Learning of Graph-Based Anomaly Detectors from Cybersecurity to Linguistic Data",
    "Problem_Statement": "Anomaly detection models leveraging graph neural networks developed extensively in cybersecurity domains rarely transfer knowledge to linguistic anomaly detection, missing an opportunity to fill modality silos and leverage mature cyber data methodologies.",
    "Motivation": "This project explicitly exploits the hidden bridge of graph-based anomaly detection from cybersecurity and applies transfer learning paradigms to adapt these models to linguistic and code modalities relevant to LLM dataset security, addressing siloed development and modality isolation gaps.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a transfer learning pipeline where GNN anomaly detectors pretrained on cybersecurity-oriented code vulnerability graphs or network traffic graphs are adapted via domain-adversarial training and domain-specific graph augmentations to linguistic data graphs reflecting syntax, semantics, and discourse structures. This facilitates cross-domain knowledge reuse, improving detection of complex anomalies in linguistic data without requiring extensive labeled linguistic anomaly datasets.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Source large cybersecurity graph datasets with labeled anomalies. 2) Pretrain GNN anomaly detectors on these datasets. 3) Construct linguistic graphs from text and code data. 4) Adapt pretrained models with domain adaptation techniques to linguistic graphs. 5) Measure anomaly detection improvements against linguistic-only training and no-transfer baselines using AUC and precision-recall.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Linguistic graph data representing syntactic relationships with injected anomalous constructs. Expected Output: The transferred model achieves superior anomaly detection performance and robustness compared to models trained purely on linguistic data without pretraining.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct transfer fails, explore multi-task learning combining cybersecurity and linguistic anomaly tasks or develop intermediate modality bridging representations using meta-learning."

          "feedback_content": "The experiment plan relies on constructing linguistic graphs reflecting syntax, semantics, and discourse for anomaly detection, but does not specify how these graphs will be generated or validated for quality and representativeness. Without clear methodology on linguistic graph construction and annotation of anomalies, the feasibility of adapting pretrained GNN models effectively remains questionable. It is recommended to explicitly detail graph-building methods (e.g., parsers, semantic role labeling) and anomaly injection strategies to ensure reliable and reproducible experiments that convincingly validate transfer benefits over baselines, which is critical for practical success of this cross-domain transfer approach. Moreover, clarifying dataset sources and scale for the linguistic domain will strengthen feasibility arguments in the proposal's experimental plan section. This addition will also help address potential domain mismatch issues more concretely rather than only relying on proposed domain adaptation techniques, which could be brittle without solid data foundations in linguistic graphs.

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty screening result NOV-COMPETITIVE and the challenge of effective cross-domain transfer, the proposal could substantially enhance impact and distinctiveness by integrating federated learning (FL) principles for anomaly detection across cyber and linguistic domains. Incorporating federated learning can allow models to learn collaboratively and securely from distributed datasets in heterogeneous domains while preserving privacy and autonomy. This would address real-world deployment constraints (e.g., sensitive cyber data and proprietary linguistic corpora) and amplify the contribution by building a trustworthy and scalable AI system for cross-modality anomaly detection. This integration aligns well with graph data management and trustworthy machine learning cited in the linked concepts, making the research more novel and aligned with recent advances. Specifically, adapting the domain-adversarial training within a federated learning framework or agent-based system could enrich the proposed methodology and open new research directions.
