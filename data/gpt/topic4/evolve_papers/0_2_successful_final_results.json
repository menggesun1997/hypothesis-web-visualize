    "title": "Few-Shot Multilingual Program Synthesis for Underrepresented Languages",
    "Problem_Statement": "Few-shot learning approaches for program synthesis predominantly target high-resource languages, leaving underrepresented programming dialects and language-integrated tasks underserved, limiting automation and accessibility.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gap on lack of few-shot effectiveness for underrepresented languages and expands the synthesis frontier by integrating linguistically diverse code and natural language inputs for programming-related tasks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a bilingual code-natural language synthesis model that learns to generate code snippets from natural language prompts in underrepresented language contexts with few-shot examples. It uses a dual encoder transformer capturing semantic bridging between low-resource human languages and domain-specific code structures, enhanced by meta-learning strategies to adapt quickly to new language-programming pairs with scarce data.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect small aligned datasets of programming problems and natural language descriptions in underrepresented languages (e.g., Amharic, Malagasy). 2) Pre-train with existing high-resource language data, then meta-train on low-resource pairs. 3) Fine-tune few-shot on selected programming tasks (e.g., data manipulation, arithmetic functions). 4) Evaluate code correctness, semantic accuracy, and adaptability via metrics like BLEU, exact match, and execution accuracy. 5) Benchmark against monolingual and multilingual baselines without meta-learning.",

        "title": "Typologically-Aware Few-Shot Multilingual Program Synthesis for Underrepresented Languages with Linguistic Expert Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing few-shot program synthesis methods primarily target high-resource languages, neglecting underrepresented human languages and programming dialects, which limits automation and accessibility in software development for diverse linguistic communities. This is exacerbated by the substantial typological divergences and scarce aligned datasets characteristic of truly low-resource language environments, making cross-domain transfer challenging.",
        "Motivation": "This proposal addresses a crucial research gap in enabling program synthesis for low-resource languages by explicitly modeling linguistic typological features and integrating domain and linguistic expertise to overcome the fragility of few-shot meta-learning in such contexts. By advancing methods that respect language equality principles and focus on real-world underrepresented languages like Amharic and Malagasy, the project seeks to provide a robust, scalable approach that outperforms existing competitive baselines while advancing inclusive multilingual AI capabilities.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a typologically-aware bilingual encoder-decoder architecture that incorporates bespoke language and programming language typological embeddings into a transformer framework, augmented with expert-informed adaptation modules co-designed with linguists and programming language experts. These modules dynamically adjust representations to better capture syntactic and semantic divergences across natural and programming languages. To mitigate the scarcity of aligned corpora, we integrate synthetic data augmentation techniques driven by linguistic typology dictionaries and code templates, combined with retrieval-augmented generation using curated code repositories. Our meta-learning approach employs a curriculum learning schedule progressively introducing language-code pairs by typological similarity clusters, reducing catastrophic forgetting while maximizing transferable knowledge. The method systematically embeds principles from audiovisual translation and sign language research regarding cross-modal and cross-linguistic equivalences, ensuring quality semantic bridging. This integrated strategy ensures robust few-shot adaptation, pioneering inclusivity in multilingual program synthesis.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Strategy: Collaborate with linguistic and programming language domain experts to curate and validate small, high-quality aligned natural language-code datasets for underrepresented languages such as Amharic and Malagasy, harnessing community engagement, crowdsourcing with ethical protocols, and leveraging existing code documentation where feasible. 2) Synthetic Data: Develop and apply linguistically informed synthetic data generation pipelines, using typological insights and template-driven program generation to augment scarce corpora. 3) Pre-training: Train the bilingual typologically-aware encoder-decoder on high-resource language-code pairs augmented with synthetic low-resource data, incorporating curriculum learning progressing from structurally similar to distant languages. 4) Meta-Training: Implement a meta-learning phase with language typology-informed tasks to maximize cross-domain generalization and minimize catastrophic forgetting, using ablations to determine minimal data volume thresholds. 5) Fine-tuning: Perform few-shot adaptation on representative programming tasks (e.g., data manipulation, arithmetic functions) in target low-resource languages. 6) Evaluation: Combine standard metrics (BLEU, exact match, execution accuracy) with human expert evaluation focusing on semantic correctness and usability, and domain-specific validation to measure real-world applicability. 7) Ablation and Robustness Studies: Conduct extensive analyses to isolate effects of typology embeddings, expert adaptation modules, data augmentation, and curriculum strategies. 8) Documentation and Open Release: Publish datasets, models, and protocols to ensure reproducibility and community advancement.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Natural language instruction in Amharic \"\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\" (Write code to display current time).\nExpected Output: Correct, executable code snippet that outputs current time, syntactically and semantically adapted to the underrepresented language context, verified by linguistic and programming language experts.\n\nInput: Malagasy instruction for sorting a list of integers.\nExpected Output: Executable sorting code syntactically reflecting Malagasy natural language nuances and programming dialect conventions, demonstrating few-shot adaptation capacity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If few-shot adaptation underperforms due to data scarcity or typological complexity, enhance retrieval-augmented generation by integrating external large codebases with metadata rich in linguistic and programming dialect annotations. Further, intensify synthetic data generation using typological variation probes and expand collaboration with linguistic experts for iterative refinement. Employ error-driven curriculum adjustments and explore additional architectures incorporating multimodal audiovisual translation strategies, such as code-comment video walkthroughs, to better ground semantics."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that a dual encoder transformer with meta-learning can effectively bridge low-resource human languages and domain-specific code structures despite inherent linguistic and syntactic divergences. However, low-resource natural languages often lack the aligned corpora and structural regularities that enable successful model transfer applied in high-resource contexts. Clarify how linguistic typological differences and scarce aligned examples will be addressed to justify this core assumption, perhaps considering language typology-specific adaptations or augmentations to the encoder architecture to better model non-standard syntax and semantics in code and natural language pairs, thus strengthening foundational soundness of the method design and assumptions about cross-domain generalization capabilities in underrepresented languages and programming dialects. This clarity is essential before investing in meta-learning for adaptation since few-shot effectiveness heavily depends on this representational bridging quality and underlying data representativeness for training and evaluation phases as proposed. Suggest incorporating linguistic and programming language experts’ insights or pilot analyses to validate this foundational assumption early in the development cycle to reduce risk of failure on low-resource pairs due to misunderstood cross-domain semantic mappings or alignment scarcity constraints inherent in the problem statement and proposed approach framework. This deeper validation step is vital given the ambitious span of language and code diversity targeted with few-shot meta-learning from limited data, which can be a highly fragile assumption demanding explicit justification and mitigation strategies beyond generic meta-learning techniques currently indicated in the method without sufficient foundational elaboration or robustness considerations against prevalent data scarcity and linguistic variability challenges in truly underrepresented languages and dialects seen in the real world, including Amharic and Malagasy contexts cited in the experiment plan and test cases sections of the proposal."

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan, while logically ordered, lacks sufficient operational detail regarding data collection and quality assurance for the underrepresented languages. Collecting aligned datasets in low-resource languages such as Amharic and Malagasy is a nontrivial and resource-intensive task; the plan should elaborate on strategies for obtaining high-quality parallel code-natural language pairs given the scarcity of open-source resources, including potential community engagement, crowdsourcing protocols, or synthetic data generation prior to pre-training. Furthermore, the plan relies heavily on pre-training with high-resource language data before meta-training on low-resource pairs; explicit methodologies for balancing data distributions, mitigating catastrophic forgetting, and ensuring that meta-learning successfully adapts rather than overfits to limited few-shot samples need to be fleshed out. Consider incorporating rigorous ablation studies on data volume thresholds and curriculum learning schedules to empirically establish feasible data requirements and adaptation efficacy. Additionally, the evaluation metrics proposed (BLEU, exact match, execution accuracy) are standard but not always fully indicative of semantic correctness or usability in multilingual low-resource program synthesis — integrating human evaluation or task-specific domain validation criteria could significantly improve experimental robustness and result interpretability. Overall, further explication on practical challenges and contingency plans around the experiment pipeline, dataset curation, meta-learning implementation details, and multifaceted evaluation strategies is necessary to convincingly establish feasibility and reproducibility for the proposed research endeavor."
