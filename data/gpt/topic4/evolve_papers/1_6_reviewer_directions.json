    "title": "Morpho-Syntactic Typology Embeddings for Enhanced Multilingual Knowledge Graphs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current multilingual knowledge graphs lack typological information, limiting their use in linguistically diverse applications and cross-language reasoning.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gaps by embedding deep morpho-syntactic typology directly into knowledge graph node and edge representations, enriching semantic connections across typologically diverse languages.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop embeddings for linguistic units enriched with typological signatures derived from aligned typology resources. Integrate these into knowledge graph construction and completion methods to improve semantic link prediction and multilingual query resolution in typologically diverse contexts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Extract morpho-syntactic typology features from WALS and URIEL; 2) Map typological vectors to knowledge graph nodes; 3) Train typology-aware graph embedding models (e.g., graph neural networks); 4) Evaluate knowledge graph completion and multilingual question answering; 5) Contrast with standard graph embedding baselines; 6) Analyze semantic cluster coherence influenced by typology.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Querying a multilingual knowledge graph for concept equivalences considering word order and morphological variants in Turkish and Japanese nodes. Expected output: Improved alignment and retrieval results respecting typological variation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct embedding integration underperforms, explore multi-view learning with separate typology and semantic embeddings fused during downstream tasks."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed method aims to enrich knowledge graph embeddings with morpho-syntactic typological features from resources like WALS and URIEL, the integration mechanism remains underspecified. It is unclear how typological vectors will be effectively fused with traditional semantic embeddings within graph neural networks and whether this fusion preserves meaningful linguistic distinctions. Further, the pathway by which these enriched embeddings concretely improve semantic link prediction and multilingual query resolution needs stronger theoretical grounding and algorithmic description to ensure soundness and interpretability of results. Consider clarifying the embedding architecture, fusion strategy, and how typological signals directly influence downstream tasks to solidify your method’s core mechanism and validity in diverse linguistic settings, especially given typological complexity and potential noise in typology data sources (e.g., WALS coverage gaps). This would also help mitigate risks of embedding redundancy or dilution of semantic signals under typological augmentation, keeping the framework robust and theoretically justified. Targeting the Proposed_Method section is critical for improving the submission’s clarity and methodological soundness."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict NOV-COMPETITIVE and focus on morpho-syntactic typology embeddings primarily targeting knowledge graphs, consider expanding the impact and novelty by integrating insights from the 'Now-or-Never bottleneck' and 'language acquisition' concepts. Specifically, explore how real-time processing constraints (Now-or-Never bottleneck) and grammatical cue learning from language acquisition research can inform the design of typology embeddings and graph updates, potentially moving beyond static typological features to dynamic, usage-driven representations. This integration could foster embeddings that better capture on-the-fly language processing patterns and cognitive constraints across typologically diverse languages, enhancing the knowledge graph's real-world utility in modeling language understanding and generation. Additionally, linking properties like 'word order rules' and 'grammatical cues' closer to the embeddings could make semantic connections more cognitively plausible and enhance cross-lingual reasoning capabilities. This suggestion targets enhancing both the approach's theoretical foundation and broadening its impact, directly relevant to the Proposed_Method and Motivation sections."
