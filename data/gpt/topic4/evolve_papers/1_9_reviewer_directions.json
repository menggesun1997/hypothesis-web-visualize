    "title": "Ethical Framework for Linguistic Data Sovereignty via Decentralized Governance",
    "Problem_Statement": "Indigenous and minority language data are vulnerable to misuse, with limited practical frameworks for enforcing data sovereignty and ethical sharing in large-scale NLP research.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external gap relating to ethical and socio-cultural dimensions of linguistic data governance, integrating blockchain technology with community-driven ethical frameworks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a decentralized governance protocol codified in smart contracts where linguistic communities define data use policies, consent frameworks, and auditing processes. Develop tools enabling transparent tracking of data provenance, usage compliance, and collective decision-making on data sharing.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collaborate with indigenous communities to specify ethical requirements; 2) Formalize policies into smart contract logic; 3) Implement tools for data usage tracking and policy enforcement; 4) Simulate community participation and data sharing scenarios; 5) Assess compliance, community satisfaction, and impact on linguistic data availability; 6) Propose scalability improvements as needed.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Scenario: A community restricts data use to non-commercial research; queries for data usage early warn unauthorized attempts recorded and publicly auditable on blockchain. Expected outcome: Transparent governance strengthening trust and ethical compliance.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If smart contract complexity limits adoption, develop hybrid human-smart contract governance frameworks or off-chain dispute resolution mechanisms."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-MECHANISM",
          "feedback_content": "While the high-level concept of encoding community-defined governance policies into smart contracts is clear, the proposal lacks technical details and clarity on how nuanced, dynamic, or context-dependent ethical policies will be codified in immutable code. Smart contracts are inherently rigid, yet ethical data governance often requires flexibility and interpretability. The plan should explicitly address how policy evolution, exceptions, or dispute resolution beyond strict code execution are handled, to avoid oversimplification of complex social consent mechanisms. Consider outlining mechanisms integrating on-chain and off-chain governance components more concretely to bolster the soundness of this approach, especially given the multidisciplinary ethical and technical challenges involved. Such clarity is critical to establish that the proposed method is theoretically grounded and practically implementable by linguistic communities with diverse needs and technological literacy levels. This includes clear modeling of community input translation into governance rules and technical steps ensuring compliance enforcement without over-reliance on blockchain immutability alone in socially complex contexts of language data usage. Targeting this gap will strengthen the proposal’s foundational reasoning, improve community trust in the system’s ethical fidelity, and mitigate risks of misgovernance due to technical limitations inherent to smart contracts themselves. This feedback targets the \"Proposed_Method\" section for enhanced technical and ethical mechanism clarity and robustness that underpin the method’s soundness and ethical validity of governance encoding on-chain in the sociotechnical NLP ecosystem proposed."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The experimental plan presents a reasonable sequential approach, but lacks specifics that would demonstrate practical feasibility, especially regarding community collaboration and adoption, blockchain platform choice and scalability, and quantitative or qualitative metrics for success. For example, details on how indigenous/minority communities will be engaged to elicit and formalize ethical requirements—beyond high-level collaboration—are missing, yet crucial given cultural sensitivities and linguistic diversity. Also, the plan should address how simulations will realistically model participation dynamics and whether real deployment or pilot testing is intended to validate tooling outside of simulated scenarios. Proposed compliance and satisfaction assessments remain vague; specifying evaluation criteria, data sources, and analytic methods will greatly strengthen feasibility. There is also no discussion on potential technical bottlenecks related to blockchain throughput, latency, or cost that might impede real-world use, despite an appropriate fallback plan being noted. Suggest refining Step 2 and Step 4 with more concrete experimental protocols (e.g., mock smart contract policies with community feedback cycles, blockchain environment parameters, community user studies) and integrating iterative design methodologies to iteratively validate prototype tools with direct stakeholder involvement. Addressing these feasibility gaps is essential for demonstrating that the ambitious method can be realistically developed and adopted within the proposed timeline and resource constraints. This feedback targets the \"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\" section to elevate the experiment plan from concept to actionable research execution blueprint."
