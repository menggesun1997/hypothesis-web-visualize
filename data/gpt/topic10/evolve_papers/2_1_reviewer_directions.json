    "title": "Domain Expertise-Guided Adaptive Bias Correction in Clinical NLP",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM bias mitigation in healthcare NLP lacks dynamic adaptation to varying domain expertise of users and context-specific clinical practices, reducing trustworthiness and efficacy in sensitive medical decisions.",
    "Motivation": "Directly addresses internal gaps in bias mitigation tied to domain expertise variability and external needs in healthcare ethical AI. Novel approach is adaptive and user-context sensitive, beyond static bias correction.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build an adaptive bias correction system that leverages continuous feedback from domain experts embedded as a contextual module within LLM-driven clinical NLP pipelines. This includes a meta-learning component that updates bias correction weights based on expertise signals (e.g., clinician credentials, location, specialty) and patient demographics, enabling personalized ethical alignment and factual accuracy.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect clinical note datasets annotated for common biases and errors. 2) Develop expertise embedding vectors from clinician metadata. 3) Integrate adaptive bias correction modules in a clinical LLM (e.g., ClinicalBERT + GPT). 4) Perform evaluations via clinician-in-the-loop tasks measuring bias reduction, accuracy, and trust metrics on context-specific clinical decision tasks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Patient with asthma and heart disease needs medication plan.\" Output: Bias-corrected treatment recommendations that vary appropriately according to specialty input (cardiology vs pulmonology) and patient demographics, reducing stereotypical errors.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive correction proves unstable, fallback to rule-based bias filtering using detection heuristics followed by manual domain expert overrides. Alternatively, explore static bias correction fine-tuning constrained by domain expert consensus."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an adaptive bias correction system using continuous feedback and meta-learning based on clinician metadata and patient demographics. However, the proposal lacks clarity on how expertise signals will be effectively quantified and integrated into the meta-learning component within the LLM framework. Specifically, the mechanism for adapting bias correction weights in real-time or incrementally remains vague, and potential challenges such as noisy or conflicting expertise input are not addressed. Providing a more detailed technical design or preliminary architecture, including how feedback loops operate and how the system balances multiple expertise signals, would greatly enhance soundness and reproducibility of the method. Consider specifying algorithmic components, optimization strategies, and their interactions within ClinicalBERT + GPT integration to strengthen this section's rigor and feasibility assessment in later experiments, especially given the sensitive medical domain where errors can have serious consequences.\n\nTargeted improvement: clarify and concretely specify the adaptive meta-learning mechanism integrating domain expertise embeddings within the LLM pipeline, describing how it handles variability and noise in expertise signals and ensures bias correction efficacy and stability over time.\n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"

While scientifically sound in principle, this plan oversimplifies the practical challenges in acquiring sufficiently large, high-quality annotated clinical datasets with relevant bias/error labels and associated detailed clinician metadata (credentials, location, specialty). Given patient privacy and data access constraints, the feasibility of obtaining such rich, multi-dimensional data is uncertain. Moreover, the plan lacks detail about metrics and evaluation protocols for measuring bias reduction and trustworthiness in a statistical and clinical sense. Clarifying data sourcing strategies, annotation protocols, clinician recruitment and engagement methods, and specifying quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics with thresholds for success are needed. Additionally, contingency plans for data scarcity or noisy provenance would strengthen experimental feasibility. This is critical to validate the adaptive correction approach thoroughly, especially since the fallback involves potentially lower-impact rule-based systems.\n\nTarget section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
