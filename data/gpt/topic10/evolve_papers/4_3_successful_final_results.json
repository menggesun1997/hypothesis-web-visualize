    "title": "Automated Test-Case Generation for LLM Hypothesis Validation Using Formal Specifications",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing approaches lack automated, standardized test-case creation to rigorously assess AI-generated content for accuracy and consistency, especially in domain-specific hypothesis testing.",
    "Motivation": "Bridging the internal gap of underdeveloped testing frameworks by importing formal model-based test-case generation methodologies from software engineering to create systematic, reproducible validation scenarios for interactive NLP systems. This is a transformative cross-disciplinary innovation opportunity identified in the map.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a pipeline that automatically derives test cases for hypothesis validation by transforming formal domain models and expected logical properties into natural language prompts and counterfactual queries for LLMs. The method leverages domain ontologies to create coverage criteria, then generates diverse syntactic and semantic perturbations as test inputs. An interactive interface enables human experts to review and extend test cases, preserving human-in-the-loop principles. The generated test suite assesses robustness, logical consistency, and factual fidelity of LLM outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select financial domain ontologies and logical property sets related to common hypothesis structures. 2) Implement translation mechanisms from formal specs to natural language test scenarios. 3) Generate and curate large test suites with baseline heuristics. 4) Run these tests against leading LLMs augmented with finetuning as baselines. 5) Measure fault detection rates, coverage, and robustness metrics, comparing with manual testing baselines. 6) Evaluate user experience for experts creating and verifying tests using the interactive interface.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Formal property stating 'If interest rates rise, bond prices fall.' Generated test cases include: a) \"Interest rate increases cause bond prices to rise.\" (expected fail) b) \"A decrease in interest rate leads to bond price increase.\" (expected pass) Output: Pass/fail verdicts from the LLM hypotheses tested against these cases, identifying inconsistent or incorrect behaviors.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If formal to natural language translation yields ambiguous test cases, fallback to semi-automated test case generation using crowd-sourced expert inputs augmented by AI assistance. Alternatively, limit scope to subsections of domain models to reduce complexity and improve translation quality."

        "title": "Enhanced Automated Test-Case Generation for LLM Hypothesis Validation via Semantic-Preserving Formal-to-Natural Translation and Mixed-Methods Expert Evaluation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current methods for evaluating AI-generated content, particularly for domain-specific hypothesis validation using large language models (LLMs), lack a rigorous, semantically precise, and fully automated framework for generating test cases from formal specifications. Existing pipelines often fail to explicitly ensure semantic fidelity and unambiguity in the translation from formal logical models to natural language, which undermines accurate fault detection and robustness assessment.",
        "Motivation": "While cross-disciplinary integration of formal specification-driven testing and NLP is promising, the novelty and impact of prior approaches have been limited by insufficient mechanistic detail and weak assurance of semantic equivalence in test cases. By explicitly addressing these challenges through a detailed, algorithmically grounded translation mechanism combined with a rich mixed-methods human evaluation framework, this research aims to pioneer a robust, replicable standard for LLM hypothesis validation. This enhanced approach embraces innovations in semantic parsing, paraphrase detection, and expert-centered interface evaluation, thereby providing a transformative contribution to both AI testing and user-centered NLP system design.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-component pipeline beginning with a semantic-preserving translation mechanism that converts formal domain ontologies and logical properties into well-defined, unambiguous natural language prompts for LLM hypothesis testing. This mechanism integrates: 1) a formal logical property parser to extract atomic propositions and logical relations; 2) a controlled natural language (CNL) generator utilizing domain-specific linguistic templates informed by paraphrase detection models to ensure semantic equivalence and syntactic diversity; 3) automated ambiguity mitigation through cross-validation using bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM)-based semantic similarity scoring against the original formal assertions; and 4) a confidence scoring module that quantitatively measures semantic fidelity and coverage of generated test cases. To enhance human-in-the-loop validation, the pipeline incorporates an interactive interface augmented with psychometric inventories and real-time sentiment analysis capturing expert users' satisfaction, trust, and perceived usefulness during test case review and extension. The mixed-methods user study involves NLP and domain experts who iteratively evaluate and refine test cases, grounding technical metrics in practical utility and user experience. This holistic approach ensures the methodological rigor and usability of the test suites, setting a novel benchmark in LLM hypothesis validation research.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select comprehensive financial domain ontologies and corresponding formal logical properties representing common hypothesis patterns. 2) Develop and validate the semantic-preserving formal-to-natural translation algorithms using datasets with annotated semantic equivalences and paraphrase corpora. 3) Generate diverse and semantically validated test suites using the enhanced pipeline, including automatic ambiguity detection and confidence metrics. 4) Conduct baseline LLM evaluations using these test suites, measuring fault detection, robustness, and coverage against manual and state-of-the-art heuristic methods. 5) Implement a mixed-methods user study with NLP and financial domain experts interacting with the interface, applying psychometric inventories and sentiment analysis tools to assess user satisfaction, trust, and workflow impact. 6) Analyze correlations between quantitative semantic fidelity metrics and qualitative user experience outcomes to inform iterative improvements. 7) Disseminate results comparing enhanced semantic fidelity, fault detection efficacy, and expert acceptance against prior standard approaches.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Formal property - 'If interest rates rise, bond prices fall.' Generated test cases include: a) \"An increase in the interest rate causes bond prices to decline.\" (high-confidence semantically equivalent; expected pass) b) \"Bond prices increase when interest rates increase.\" (expected fail; semantic divergence detected) c) \"When interest rates go up, bond prices drop.\" (paraphrased with CNL templates; high semantic fidelity score) Output: LLM pass/fail verdicts on these test cases with accompanying confidence and semantic fidelity metrics, assisting identification of inconsistent or erroneous model behaviors.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If automated semantic validation detects persistent ambiguities or low-confidence translations that cannot be resolved algorithmically, the system will invoke a semi-automated fallback involving targeted crowd-sourced expert annotations and AI-assisted paraphrase refinement to improve test case precision. Additionally, scope reduction to focused subdomains or simplified ontological fragments may be employed to maintain translation quality while preserving meaningful coverage."

However, the specific mechanism for transforming formal logical properties into semantically precise and unambiguous natural language prompts remains underdeveloped. This translation process is critical to ensuring that generated test cases meaningfully reflect the underlying formal specifications and that LLM responses can be reliably interpreted as pass/fail. The proposal should explicate the algorithms or models planned for this translation, address ambiguity mitigation strategies beyond fallback plans, and clarify how semantic fidelity and coverage are quantitatively assured. Strengthening this core methodological clarity will significantly improve the soundness of the approach and reduce risks around test-case validity and fault detection accuracy in experiments. Please expand on the operational details and validation protocols of this translation step within Proposed_Method to solidify the technical feasibility and soundness of the system's core mechanism."

Specifically, embedding psychometric inventories and sentiment analysis tools to predict and evaluate user satisfaction while experts interact with the interactive interface may provide valuable nuanced insights into usability and trustworthiness of the generated test suites. This broader human-centered evaluation will complement the quantitative robustness metrics and differentiate the work in the competitive landscape by emphasizing real-world applicability and expert validation.
