    "title": "Privacy-Preserving Reinforcement Learning for Sensitive Scientific NLP Pipelines",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM augmentation through reinforcement learning in scientific domains often risks privacy breaches due to sensitive domain data usage, undermining compliance and trust.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the critical gap of insufficient handling of private/sensitive data by integrating privacy-preserving mechanisms within reinforcement learning, bridging finance research needs and medical data protection practices to enable secure adaptive NLP pipelines.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a reinforcement learning architecture embedding differential privacy and secure multi-party computation techniques to safeguard sensitive information during model updates. The system adapts policies for LLM augmentation under privacy constraints, maintaining performance while preventing data leakage.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Simulate private scientific datasets with labeled sensitive attributes. 2) Develop RL agents with privacy modules leveraging DP-SGD and MPC. 3) Benchmark against non-private RL baselines on accuracy, privacy leakage, and utility. 4) Perform ablation to quantify privacy-performance tradeoffs.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Financial document dataset requiring private interpretation. Expected output: LLM-generated insights with reinforcement learning-driven improvements, verified to comply with privacy guarantees and no data disclosure.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If privacy mechanisms degrade utility excessively, explore relaxed privacy guarantees or federated RL approaches with reduced communication overhead and decentralized privacy preserving."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method combines differential privacy (DP) and secure multi-party computation (MPC) for reinforcement learning (RL) adaptations, but the mechanism lacks clarity on how these privacy techniques will be integrated seamlessly. For instance, DP-SGD is typically applied in supervised learning contexts, and MPC introduces significant communication and computation overhead. It is not clear how these will be coordinated within the RL framework, especially during policy updates that require extensive interaction with an LLM. The proposal should clarify the architecture and workflow, detailing how privacy guarantees are maintained without prohibitive performance degradation, and how RL exploration-exploitation dynamics are affected by privacy noise and multiparty computations. Providing a formalized description or diagram of the privacy-embedded RL model and explaining how private gradients, rewards, or transitions are handled will strengthen soundness and feasibility substantially. Without such clarity, the core innovation risks being underspecified or unrealistic in practice, especially given the complexity of scientific NLP pipelines involving sensitive data domains like finance or medicine, where compliance is strict and errors costly. Consider referencing existing private RL works or privacy-preserving NLP augmentations to build a concrete method design and avoid assumptions incompatible with practical deployment scenarios in these domains."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed experiment plan is well-structured but risks underestimating the complexity and resources needed to realistically simulate private scientific datasets and implement MPC-enhanced RL agents. Step 1's simulation of private datasets requires careful design to authentically model domain-specific sensitive attributes and privacy risks, which can be nontrivial given heterogeneous scientific data structures. Additionally, Step 2's development of privacy modules combining DP-SGD and MPC within RL agents is technically demanding, especially to achieve a usable trade-off between privacy and utility. The plan should specify concrete dataset sources or synthetic data generation protocols reflecting real-world complexity, validation metrics beyond accuracy and privacy leakage (such as compliance with legal frameworks), and detailed evaluation of computational costs. Moreover, the fallback plan hints at federated RL but does not clarify how this alternative would be experimentally evaluated or integrated with privacy guarantees. To enhance feasibility, the experiment plan would benefit from preliminary benchmarking on existing public datasets or off-the-shelf RL environments augmented with privacy libraries. Clarifying computational budgets, potential bottlenecks, and success criteria will also improve the experiment design and practical execution roadmap."
