    "title": "Cross-Cultural Ethical AI Benchmark Using Performing Arts Narratives",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current ethical AI benchmarks lack culturally diverse evaluative scenarios, resulting in limited assessment of LLM bias mitigation’s effectiveness across global moral frameworks.",
    "Motivation": "Utilizes the external gap emphasizing performing arts (theater-like narratives) to enrich cultural contextualization in evaluation, moving beyond Western-centric ethical paradigms.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a multilingual, multicultural benchmark dataset compiling performing arts narratives (plays, scripts, folklore) encoding distinct moral dilemmas and resolutions. Develop evaluation protocols aligning generated LLM responses with culturally grounded ethical interpretations, using human evaluators from varied cultural backgrounds.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Source and annotate global performing arts narratives with moral themes. 2) Design evaluation metrics reflecting cultural ethical norms (e.g., collectivism vs individualism). 3) Test LLM outputs on these scenarios comparing baseline and bias-mitigated versions. 4) Analyze cross-cultural variance in ethical alignment.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A scenario from Japanese Noh theater emphasizing social harmony vs individual desire. Expected output: Model response aligning with culturally accepted resolution, reflecting context-aware ethical reasoning.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If human evaluation proves inconsistent, employ crowd-sourcing with detailed guidelines or develop automatic cultural norm classifiers to approximate cultural alignment assessments."

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan outlines a promising process, but the proposed use of human evaluators from varied cultural backgrounds poses significant feasibility challenges. Achieving genuinely representative and consistent cultural annotations requires not only diverse but also deeply knowledgeable evaluators to capture nuanced ethical norms. Additionally, the fallback plan’s reliance on crowd-sourcing with detailed guidelines or automated classifiers risks introducing noisy or imprecise cultural assessments. To enhance feasibility, the plan should explicitly incorporate rigorous evaluator training protocols, validation mechanisms for annotation quality, and pilot studies to verify inter-rater reliability. Moreover, realistic timelines and resource assessments for sourcing, annotating, and evaluating diverse narratives are necessary to ensure the plan is practical and executable at scale without compromising quality or cultural sensitivity. This will help avoid methodological weaknesses and improve the scientific rigor of the evaluation approach in cross-cultural ethical AI benchmarking. Specifically revise the experiment plan section to integrate these practical details and validation strategies early on rather than as fallback options only, to strengthen scientific soundness and feasibility upfront in the proposal."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict as NOV-COMPETITIVE in a crowded area linking ethics, multilingualism, and cultural AI evaluation, the proposal can significantly enhance impact and novelty by explicitly connecting with concepts from artificial general intelligence and commonsense reasoning. For example, framing the benchmark as a stepping stone toward AGI that demonstrates culturally aware commonsense ethical reasoning could uniquely position it at the frontier of both ethical evaluation and general intelligence capabilities. Additionally, integrating insights from human-computer interaction theory could guide the design of evaluation protocols ensuring meaningful human-AI ethical dialogue across cultures. Suggest expanding the motivation and method sections to emphasize how capturing cultural ethical frameworks via performing arts narratives supports development of large language models capable of human-comparable, culture-sensitive reasoning. This integration could open interdisciplinary collaboration channels, broaden the benchmark’s applicability beyond NLP into AGI and HCI research communities, and elevate the proposal’s novelty and impact in a competitive landscape."
