    "title": "Generative AI with Critical Thinking Scaffolds for Student Bias Literacy",
    "Problem_Statement": "Students engaging with AI-generated content often lack critical appraisal tools to recognize and understand embedded biases, limiting the educational potential of LLMs in promoting digital literacy and ethical awareness.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses gaps related to human oversight, critical appraisal, and AI bias literacy in education by combining generative AI with explicit critical thinking scaffolding, advancing beyond current few-shot prompt engineering.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a generative AI tutoring system embedding layered critical-thinking prompts and meta-cognitive reflection questions triggered dynamically during content generation. Incorporate scaffolding inspired by self-regulated learning theories and critical appraisal skills to foster awareness of biases in generated outputs, encouraging iterative student-LLM dialogue and self-correction.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop curriculum-aligned prompts with critical-thinking scaffolds. 2) Integrate these into a fine-tuned LLM (e.g., GPT-4) interface for education. 3) Conduct classroom trials measuring student engagement, bias recognition improvement, and learning outcomes using validated digital literacy scales.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Explain the impact of historical figures.\" AI generates content with embedded prompts like \"What perspectives might be missing here?\" and \"Can you identify potential stereotypes?\" Students respond and improve output iteratively.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If scaffolding reduces engagement, adjust prompt complexity or introduce gamified bias-detection challenges. Alternatively, implement teacher-moderated AI sessions for guided critical appraisal."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines embedding layered critical-thinking prompts and meta-cognitive reflection dynamically during content generation, inspired by self-regulated learning theories. However, the mechanism by which the system detects appropriate moments for scaffold triggers, evaluates student responses, and adapts the dialogue iteratively requires clearer elaboration. Explicit modeling or algorithmic design explaining how critical thinking scaffolds integrate seamlessly without disrupting natural dialogue flow or overwhelming students would strengthen soundness. Clarifying interaction modes and adaptation strategies will reassure reviewers about the method’s internal consistency and credibility within an LLM-based tutor context, especially given potential challenges in reliably triggering reflection prompts during generation phases, as well as handling diverse student inputs robustly. Please expand on these technical and pedagogical integration details to solidify the approach’s conceptual foundation and demonstrate feasibility at a mechanism level early in design phases, before classroom testing steps. Targeting an architecture diagram or interaction flow would be beneficial here to reveal assumptions and clarify innovation nuances beyond prompt engineering alone, establishing theoretical grounding for dynamically scaffolded critical thinking in generative AI education systems implicitly stated but currently underdeveloped in the proposal section \"Proposed_Method.\" This will also aid in distinguishing the approach within the competitive research space noted in novelty assessment, focusing reviewers on the unique value in AI-driven personalized critical engagement with bias literacy content, not only surface prompt design refinements or gamification fallback options suggested later in the plan. \n\n-- Key Ask: Please clearly articulate the core mechanism and dynamic scaffold invocation process of the generative AI tutor system, highlighting technical and pedagogical interplay in \"Proposed_Method.\""

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and the competitive intersection of generative AI, education, and bias literacy areas, you should explicitly integrate concepts like \"Universal Design for Learning\" and \"self-determined learning strategies\" from the globally-linked concepts. Doing so can broaden the system’s applicability and impact by personalizing critical-thinking scaffolds to diverse learners’ needs, preferences, and motivation profiles, thereby enhancing individual engagement and agency within STEM education ecosystems and digital literacy frameworks. Moreover, connecting with \"AI literacy\" and \"personal learning environments\" will extend the method beyond classroom trials to scalable deployment and lifelong learner contexts, amplifying societal and educational value. Introducing adaptive scaffold tiers responding not only to dialogue but also to psychometric or motivational signals would position the research at the cutting edge of intelligent decision-making and self-regulated learning strategies. This integration would advance the current approach beyond few-shot prompt layers toward a holistic AI tutor ecosystem embedding essential 21st-century skills for university students and beyond. Consider explicitly discussing this in the revised proposal and experiment plan, potentially collaborating with educators in STEM or language education areas to validate design principles aligned with universal design and self-determination theories.\n\n-- Key Ask: Leverage related educational frameworks and adaptive learning strategies from globally-linked concepts to elevate novelty and impact, aiming for a system that supports diverse learners within inclusive and motivationally grounded AI literacy environments."
