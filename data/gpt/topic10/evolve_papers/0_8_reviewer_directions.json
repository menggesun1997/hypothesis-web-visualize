    "title": "Federated Multi-Domain NLP Pipelines with Privacy-Enhanced LLM Adaptation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Centralized training of LLMs for scientific domains is often infeasible due to private or proprietary data constraints across institutions.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap of private data handling by designing federated learning NLP pipelines enabling collaborative LLM adaptation while preserving data privacy, inspired by biomedical and finance domain practices.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a federated learning system where local scientific institutions fine-tune LLMs on-site with privacy-preserving aggregations enabling cross-domain knowledge sharing without raw data exchange, integrating differential privacy and secure aggregation protocols.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Setup federated learning infrastructure across simulated institutional nodes. 2) Collect domain-specific private datasets for tuning. 3) Evaluate model generalization, privacy guarantees, and utility versus centralized training.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multiple pharma labs with proprietary genomic data fine-tuning shared LLM. Output: Adapted LLM performing well on broader biomedical literature tasks without disclosing raw data.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated setup proves communication-heavy, explore hierarchical aggregation or asynchronous update schemes for efficiency."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-MECHANISM",
          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a high-level federated learning system with privacy guarantees but lacks sufficient detail on how differential privacy and secure aggregation are concretely integrated with the LLM fine-tuning process across heterogeneous scientific domains. Clarify the technical design choices, such as model update mechanisms, privacy budget management, and handling domain-specific data heterogeneity, to ensure the mechanism is sound and reproducible. Without this clarity, the validity of the proposed adaptation and privacy claims remains uncertain, potentially impacting trustworthiness and adoption feasibility in sensitive areas like pharmaceuticals and finance where compliance requirements are strict.\n\nActionable Suggestion: Include a detailed schematic or algorithmic description showing how model updates are computed locally, privacy noise is calibrated and added, and how aggregation handles potential adversarial behavior or communication failures, especially given the multi-domain context and diverse data distributions involved. This will strengthen soundness and improve reviewers' and practitioners' confidence in the approach's viability and privacy guarantees within real-world constraints (e.g., computation, communication costs). They should also address how they plan to balance privacy strength with model utility practically in such federated scenarios."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan proposes a simulation of federated infrastructure with private datasets and evaluation on multiple criteria, which is reasonable but somewhat abstract. It lacks specificity about choice of datasets representative of the biomedical and finance domains, metrics for privacy guarantees (e.g., epsilon in differential privacy), and how model utility and generalization will be quantitatively benchmarked against strong centralized baselines.\n\nActionable Suggestion: Define explicit evaluation criteria and baselines, including which real or realistic benchmark datasets will be used per domain, clear privacy accounting methods, and utility metrics such as accuracy, F1, or domain adaptation scores. Moreover, address practical simulation details such as network conditions, node reliability, and scalability parameters to realistically assess communication overhead and convergence behavior. This grounding will substantially improve the experimental feasibility and credibility of the results."
