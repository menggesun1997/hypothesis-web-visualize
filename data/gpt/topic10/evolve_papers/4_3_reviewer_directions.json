    "title": "Automated Test-Case Generation for LLM Hypothesis Validation Using Formal Specifications",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing approaches lack automated, standardized test-case creation to rigorously assess AI-generated content for accuracy and consistency, especially in domain-specific hypothesis testing.",
    "Motivation": "Bridging the internal gap of underdeveloped testing frameworks by importing formal model-based test-case generation methodologies from software engineering to create systematic, reproducible validation scenarios for interactive NLP systems. This is a transformative cross-disciplinary innovation opportunity identified in the map.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a pipeline that automatically derives test cases for hypothesis validation by transforming formal domain models and expected logical properties into natural language prompts and counterfactual queries for LLMs. The method leverages domain ontologies to create coverage criteria, then generates diverse syntactic and semantic perturbations as test inputs. An interactive interface enables human experts to review and extend test cases, preserving human-in-the-loop principles. The generated test suite assesses robustness, logical consistency, and factual fidelity of LLM outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select financial domain ontologies and logical property sets related to common hypothesis structures. 2) Implement translation mechanisms from formal specs to natural language test scenarios. 3) Generate and curate large test suites with baseline heuristics. 4) Run these tests against leading LLMs augmented with finetuning as baselines. 5) Measure fault detection rates, coverage, and robustness metrics, comparing with manual testing baselines. 6) Evaluate user experience for experts creating and verifying tests using the interactive interface.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Formal property stating 'If interest rates rise, bond prices fall.' Generated test cases include: a) \"Interest rate increases cause bond prices to rise.\" (expected fail) b) \"A decrease in interest rate leads to bond price increase.\" (expected pass) Output: Pass/fail verdicts from the LLM hypotheses tested against these cases, identifying inconsistent or incorrect behaviors.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If formal to natural language translation yields ambiguous test cases, fallback to semi-automated test case generation using crowd-sourced expert inputs augmented by AI assistance. Alternatively, limit scope to subsections of domain models to reduce complexity and improve translation quality."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an ambitious pipeline that translates formal domain models into natural language test cases for LLM hypothesis validation. However, the specific mechanism for transforming formal logical properties into semantically precise and unambiguous natural language prompts remains underdeveloped. This translation process is critical to ensuring that generated test cases meaningfully reflect the underlying formal specifications and that LLM responses can be reliably interpreted as pass/fail. The proposal should explicate the algorithms or models planned for this translation, address ambiguity mitigation strategies beyond fallback plans, and clarify how semantic fidelity and coverage are quantitatively assured. Strengthening this core methodological clarity will significantly improve the soundness of the approach and reduce risks around test-case validity and fault detection accuracy in experiments. Please expand on the operational details and validation protocols of this translation step within Proposed_Method to solidify the technical feasibility and soundness of the system's core mechanism."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating and the research's focus on formal specifications and test generation, integrating a mixed-methods user study involving natural language processing experts could substantially enhance impact and novelty. Specifically, embedding psychometric inventories and sentiment analysis tools to predict and evaluate user satisfaction while experts interact with the interactive interface may provide valuable nuanced insights into usability and trustworthiness of the generated test suites. This broader human-centered evaluation will complement the quantitative robustness metrics and differentiate the work in the competitive landscape by emphasizing real-world applicability and expert validation. Consider augmenting the experimental plan to involve such mixed-methods assessments to deepen understanding of expert interactions, enhance user satisfaction measures, and ground the technical contributions within user experience research in NLP."
