      "abstract": "Transformative artificially intelligent tools, such as ChatGPT, designed to generate sophisticated text indistinguishable from that produced by a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.",

It is freely accessible through a web portal created by the tool's developer, OpenAI. The program-which automatically creates text based on written prompts-is so popular that it's likely to be \"at capacity right now\" if you attempt to use it. When you do get through, ChatGPT provides endless entertainment. I asked it to rewrite the first scene of the classic American play <i>Death of a Salesman</i>, but to feature Princess Elsa from the animated movie <i>Frozen</i> as the main character instead of Willy Loman. The output was an amusing conversation in which Elsa-who has come home from a tough day of selling-is told by her son Happy, \"Come on, Mom. You're Elsa from <i>Frozen</i>. You have ice powers and you're a queen. You're unstoppable.\" Mash-ups like this are certainly fun, but there are serious implications for generative AI programs like ChatGPT in science and academia.",

It will argue that even assuming that the choices of AIs can be deemed free, they could not be considered creative due to the anthropological footprint of copyright law which traditionally covers only human creativity. This implies that copyright protection can be granted only to outputs that display a sufficient level of original human intervention, which is most likely present in AI-assisted works and, depending on the case, in AI-genassisted works, too. The desirability of stretching copyright further to accommodate artificial creativity is also lessened by the risk that it could saturate the creative market due to an overexpansion of monopoly rights. Thus, the copyright solution will be evaluated together with some existing alternative legal tools, such as neighbouring rights, sui generis rights, patents, or even the absence of protection over AI-generated works to preserve a robust public domain.",

      "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful and emerging technique for solving complex decision-making problems by learning from experience and interaction with an environment. In the field of finance, DRL has the potential to revolutionize the way we optimize portfolios, manage risk, and execute trades, by leveraging the vast amounts of data available and the ability of neural networks to learn and adapt. However, applying DRL to finance problems also poses several challenges, such as dealing with high-dimensional state spaces, long-term dependencies, and limited data. In this paper, we review the key concepts and algorithms of DRL, and we describe the opportunities and challenges of applying DRL to finance problems, such as portfolio optimization, risk management, and algorithmic trading. We also present several case studies and examples of how DRL has been applied to finance problems, and we discuss the evaluation and potential future directions of DRL in finance. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of DRL in finance and to highlight the potential and limitations of this promising field of research and application.",

This field of research has been able to solve a wide range of complex decisionmaking tasks that were previously out of reach for a machine. Thus, deep RL opens up many new applications in domains such as healthcare, robotics, smart grids, finance, and many more. This manuscript provides an introduction to deep reinforcement learning models, algorithms and techniques. Particular focus is on the aspects related to generalization and how deep RL can be used for practical applications. We assume the reader is familiar with basic machine learning concepts.",

      "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been envisioned to have a competitive edge in quantitative finance. However, there is a steep development curve for quantitative traders to obtain an agent that automatically positions to win in the market, namely to decide where to trade, at what price and what quantity, due to the error-prone programming and arduous debugging. In this paper, we present the first open-source framework FinRL as a full pipeline to help quantitative traders overcome the steep learning curve. FinRL is featured with simplicity, applicability and extensibility under the key principles, full-stack framework, customization, reproducibility and hands-on tutoring. Embodied as a three-layer architecture with modular structures, FinRL implements fine-tuned state-of-the-art DRL algorithms and common reward functions, while alleviating the debugging work- loads. Thus, we help users pipeline the strategy design at a high turnover rate. At multiple levels of time granularity, FinRL simu- lates various markets as training environments using historical data and live trading APIs. Being highly extensible, FinRL reserves a set of user-import interfaces and incorporates trading constraints such as market friction, market liquidity and investor’s risk-aversion. Moreover, serving as practitioners’ stepping stones, typical trad- ing tasks are provided as step-by-step tutorials, e.g., stock trading, portfolio allocation, cryptocurrency trading, etc.",
