        "title": "FederatedSwin: Privacy-Preserving Hierarchical Transformers for NLP Dense Prediction",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current hierarchical Transformer architectures excel in vision tasks but are rarely adapted for federated learning paradigms in NLP dense prediction tasks, leading to privacy and scalability challenges when large labeled datasets are unavailable.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal critical gap of limited integration of federated learning with resource-aware Transformer architectures, specifically enhancing privacy and efficiency in decentralized NLP dense prediction.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop FederatedSwin, a novel hierarchical Transformer backbone tailored for federated NLP tasks involving dense prediction like token classification and semantic parsing. It integrates federated averaging with privacy-preserving mechanisms such as differential privacy, combined with resource-efficient shifted window attention adapted to textual sequence structures. The architecture also leverages adaptive model pruning during local training to reduce communication costs without sacrificing accuracy.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Pretrain FederatedSwin on public NLP datasets (e.g., OntoNotes, CoNLL) under centralized settings.\n2. Implement federated training simulation on synthetic splits mimicking heterogeneous client data.\n3. Compare against centralized baselines and existing federated NLP models in terms of accuracy, communication efficiency, and privacy guarantees.\n4. Evaluate on token-level dense prediction tasks (NER, POS tagging) and semantic role labeling.\n5. Run ablations on attention window size, pruning ratio, and privacy budget.\nMetrics: F1 score, communication overhead, differential privacy epsilon, and model size.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A distributed client dataset where each client holds sentences from different domains (e.g., legal, medical).

        "Problem_Statement": "Current end-to-end dense prediction in NLP lacks unified frameworks that exploit structured representations via graph neural networks alongside Transformers, constraining effective context modeling with resource-efficiency.",
        "Motivation": "Fills the internal gap by combining graph convolution techniques with efficient Transformer backbones to improve structured dense prediction performance in resource-aware NLP models without increasing computational cost.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Introduce GraphFuse, a hybrid architecture where input text is locally encoded by a resource-aware Transformer backbone (e.g., a windowed attention variant), whose outputs serve as node features in a dynamically constructed textual graph. Graph convolutional layers model syntactic and semantic relations explicitly to capture long-range dependencies. The fused embeddings feed into a prediction head for dense tasks like dependency parsing or token classification. The model uses lightweight graph construction heuristics to maintain computational efficiency.",

        "Proposed_Method": "Propose FedGraphTransformer, where each client trains a local Transformer model with lightweight resource-aware modifications (e.g., shifted window attention). A global graph modeling server aggregates client embeddings and their inter-client relationship encoded as a graph, updating the Transformer parameters to capture global semantic dependencies across clients. This graph-augmented aggregation improves generalization on resource-constrained devices and leverages privacy-preserving updates.",
