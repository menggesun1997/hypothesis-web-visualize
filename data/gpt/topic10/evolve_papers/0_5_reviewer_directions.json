    "title": "Dynamic Legal Norm Integration Engine for LLM Scientific Pipelines",
    "Problem_Statement": "Rapidly evolving legal norms around IP, data privacy, and AI use are poorly integrated into NLP research systems, risking compliance failures.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical external gap of dynamic legal and ethical integration by creating a system that continuously updates and enforces compliance policies within LLM-augmented scientific discovery pipelines, inspired by adaptive IT governance frameworks in organizations.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an AI-driven legal norm ingestion engine that parses new legislation and policies into machine-readable compliance rules, which are then applied to control model behavior, data usage, and output disclosures in real-time.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect corpora of AI-related laws and guidelines. 2) Train NLP models to extract normative statements and map to compliance rules. 3) Simulate application in LLM pipelines with compliance monitoring. 4) Evaluate ability to enforce and update norms automatically.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Updated GDPR clauses. Expected output: Pipeline auto-adjusts data handling and output publication rules ensuring compliance with new legislation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If norm extraction is error-prone, incorporate human-in-the-loop validation and periodic manual updates."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks sufficient detail about how the AI-driven ingestion engine will reliably parse and translate diverse and often ambiguous legal texts into enforceable, machine-readable compliance rules. Clarify the underlying NLP techniques, rule formalization strategies, and how ambiguity and contextual nuances will be handled to ensure robust, real-time compliance enforcement within LLM pipelines. This clarity is essential to establish soundness and trust in the system's compliance capabilities, especially given legal texts' complexity and variability across jurisdictions and time frames as stated in the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "While the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines reasonable stages, it underestimates the significant challenges in collecting comprehensive, up-to-date AI-related legislation corpora and reliably simulating real-world LLM pipeline integration for compliance monitoring. Strengthen the feasibility by specifying strategies for data acquisition, annotation for normative content, handling evolving and ambiguous legal norms, and more detailed simulation environments covering diverse pipeline configurations and compliance scenarios. Additionally, a clearer plan for quantitative evaluation metrics assessing the correctness, timeliness, and impact of real-time norm enforcement is needed to ensure practical validation."
