    "title": "Participatory Co-Design Platform for Interactive LLM-Based Hypothesis Validation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current human-in-the-loop LLM systems lack user-centered design tailored to domain-specific needs, resulting in suboptimal usability, trust, and ethical compliance when used for scientific hypothesis testing.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical external gap of insufficient integration of participatory co-design methodologies from health sciences and implementation science into AI research tools. By fusing these principles, we can create systems that better align with user workflows and ethical standards, a key innovation opportunity from the analysis.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a modular co-design platform enabling domain experts to iteratively customize and adapt LLM-driven interactive hypothesis testing interfaces. It incorporates workshops, live user feedback capture, and rapid prototyping loops supported by qualitative and quantitative analytics. The system supports customization of interaction modalities, transparency levels, and ethical compliance settings. Built-in adaptive tutorials and ethical guidelines keep users informed. The platform also integrates automatically extracted user behavior metrics to guide iterative improvements aligned with implementation science principles.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Recruit domain experts from at least two fields (e.g., finance and healthcare) to participate in co-design sessions. 2) Develop initial prototype interactive hypothesis testing interfaces using current LLM APIs. 3) Conduct participatory design workshops to elicit user needs, constraints, and ethical concerns. 4) Implement iterative software updates based on feedback cycles, guided by implementation science frameworks. 5) Evaluate system usability, ethical compliance adherence, and research productivity improvements through controlled user studies and cognitive workload assessments.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A financial analyst uses the platform to evaluate a generated hypothesis on market volatility. The system offers customizable explanation detail levels and guides the user with ethical notes on data privacy. Output includes an adapted UI based on user preferences with interactive explanation panels, suggested refinements from ethical risk assessments, and logs of user decisions enabling future system tuning.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If participatory co-design proves too slow or inconsistent, fallback to a semi-automated user adaptation framework employing reinforcement learning from user feedback to dynamically optimize interaction design. Alternatively, incorporate off-the-shelf usability heuristics from health informatics to accelerate compliance."

        "title": "Participatory Co-Design Platform for Interactive LLM-Based Hypothesis Validation with Urban Digital Twin Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current human-in-the-loop Large Language Model (LLM) systems often lack user-centered, domain-specific designs tailored to the unique needs of multidisciplinary experts. This results in challenges regarding usability, trust, ethical compliance, and adaptability, especially when applied to complex hypothesis testing across diverse fields such as science, finance, healthcare, and urban systems modeling.",
        "Motivation": "While prior systems have incorporated human-in-the-loop elements, they rarely employ participatory co-design methodologies drawn from health sciences and implementation science frameworks to truly align system functionalities with domain experts' workflows and ethical standards. Furthermore, the increasing relevance of urban digital twins—a sophisticated socio-technical modeling domain requiring multidisciplinary stakeholder involvement—reveals a critical gap and opportunity for LLM tools that can flexibly support diverse, complex domains. By fusing participatory co-design with an application in urban digital twins alongside healthcare and finance use cases, this research targets a uniquely scalable, ethically grounded, and user-adaptive platform, addressing unmet needs to establish a more competitive and impactful human-AI collaboration paradigm.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose to develop a modular, scalable participatory co-design platform that enables domain experts to iteratively customize and tailor LLM-driven interactive hypothesis validation interfaces according to their field-specific needs and ethical norms. The platform will integrate:  \n- Structured participatory co-design workshops adapted per domain (finance, healthcare, and urban digital twin modeling) that capture multi-stakeholder requirements, constraints, and risk considerations.  \n- Rapid prototyping loops with built-in user feedback capturing mechanisms (quantitative usability data, qualitative reflections, and behavior metrics) aligned with implementation science principles to iteratively refine interface designs and interaction modalities.  \n- Customizable transparency and explanation layers calibrated for domain-specific ethical compliance needs and trustworthiness assurances.  \n- Integration of urban digital twin data and scenarios as a secondary use case, demonstrating platform flexibility in a complex socio-technical system with multi-stakeholder ethical and operational challenges.  \n- Adaptive tutorials and embedded ethical guidelines supporting user awareness and ongoing ethical training.  \n- Advanced logging and analytic modules that track user decisions and behaviors to guide iterative system tuning and model adaptation, potentially employing reinforcement learning for optimizing usability when participatory co-design feedback loops are constrained.  \nThis method transforms generic LLM hypothesis validation into a tailored, ethical, and domain-aware tool, broadening impact and addressing novelty gaps by explicitly integrating an urban digital twin domain alongside established fields.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Recruitment and Pilot: Identify and engage domain expert cohorts from finance, healthcare, and urban digital twin communities through partnerships with professional societies and research centers (e.g., urban informatics labs). Offer clear incentive structures including honoraria, co-authorship opportunities, and flexible participation schedules. Conduct pilot workshops with small groups (5-7 experts per domain) to refine recruitment methods, workshop protocols, and data collection instruments, ensuring feasibility and acceptability.  \n2) Prototype Development: Build initial cross-domain LLM-based interactive interfaces supporting customizable hypothesis validation workflows, incorporating adaptive explanations and ethical compliance features.  \n3) Participatory Design and Iteration: Run iterative co-design workshops (3-4 cycles per domain) combining synchronous sessions and asynchronous feedback mechanisms scheduled flexibly to accommodate expert availability, minimizing dropout risks. Employ implementation science frameworks to structure feedback incorporation systematically.  \n4) Evaluation Metrics Operationalization: Define clear, validated instruments for assessing usability (System Usability Scale), ethical compliance adherence (custom checklists based on domain codes and norms), and cognitive workload (NASA-TLX). Use mixed-method approaches—quantitative surveys, usage logs, and qualitative thematic analyses—to ensure reliable multi-dimensional evaluation.  \n5) Controlled User Studies: Conduct controlled studies comparing iterative prototypes to baseline interfaces across domains, measuring improvements in usability scores, adherence to ethical protocols, cognitive workload, and research productivity. Complement with behavioral log analyses to capture real-world use patterns.  \n6) Risk Identification and Mitigation: Prior to scaling, systematically identify risks like participant fatigue, scheduling conflicts, and potential data privacy concerns. Apply mitigation plans such as flexible workshop timing, asynchronous feedback channels, and encrypted data handling protocols.  \n7) Resource and Timeline Planning: Allocate dedicated personnel for recruitment, workshop facilitation, software development, data analysis, and ethical oversight. Project timeline detailed over 18 months with 3-month pilot, 9-month iterative design cycles, and 6-month evaluation and dissemination phases.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A financial analyst accesses the platform to iteratively test a hypothesis regarding market volatility. The system offers a customizable interface adjusting explanation granularity and surfaces embedded ethical notes on data sensitivity and compliance. The analyst provides live feedback during workshops and asynchronously, shaping UI refinements that enhance interpretability and trust.  \nOutput: An adapted, user-specific interface displaying interactive explanation panels with contextual ethical risk assessments. Logged user decisions and behavior analytics inform continual system tuning and demonstrate enhanced usability and workflow alignment.  \nSecond Input: Urban planners and data scientists collaborate within the platform to validate hypotheses about traffic flow impacts in an urban digital twin environment, integrating multi-source data inputs and stakeholder concerns.  \nSecond Output: Domain-tailored interactive hypothesis testing tools, including multi-modal explanations and scenario simulations, incorporate feedback from diverse stakeholders, embedding explicit ethical safeguards around urban data privacy and social equity considerations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should participatory co-design cycles encounter delays or limited expert engagement, we will pivot to a semi-automated user adaptation framework utilizing reinforcement learning algorithms that optimize interface design parameters dynamically based on aggregated user feedback and behavior metrics. This approach will complement empirical user modeling with established usability heuristics drawn from health informatics to maintain rapid compliance with ethical guidelines and improve user experience. Additionally, asynchronous feedback channels and targeted off-the-shelf modules will be integrated to accelerate iterations and broaden expert inclusion when synchronous workshops are infeasible."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while conceptually sound, lacks detail on key practical challenges that could impact feasibility. Specifically, the recruitment plan does not clarify how domain experts will be sourced or incentivized across distinct fields, which may limit representative diversity. Also, the iterative update cycles and workshop schedules could be time-intensive and may conflict with experts' availability, risking incomplete feedback loops. Further, the evaluation metrics, particularly for ethical compliance and cognitive workload, need explicit operationalization and validated measurement instruments specified to ensure reliable assessment. Incorporating pilot testing with smaller expert groups to refine the methodology and resource planning before scaling could improve feasibility significantly. More granularity on timeline and resource allocation would also support execution confidence. This refinement is critical to avoid experiment delays or inconclusive results from implementation gaps in controlled user studies and iterative development phases. Therefore, the experiment plan should be elaborated with these practical constraints and solutions addressed upfront to assure feasibility of the proposed research approach in real-world settings and cross-domain contexts. The authors must identify risks, mitigation strategies, and detailed evaluation protocols to strengthen this aspect of the proposal upfront.\n\nTarget section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "Given the identified novelty assessment of 'NOV-COMPETITIVE,' the idea would benefit significantly by integrating the concept of 'urban digital twin' to broaden applicability and showcase impact beyond traditional scientific domains like healthcare and finance. The authors could extend the platform to support hypothesis validation in the context of urban systems modeling—such as using an urban digital twin as a case study for participatory co-design and interactive LLM-supported hypothesis testing. This could concretely demonstrate the platform’s versatility in complex socio-technical domains requiring multidisciplinary user involvement and multi-stakeholder ethical considerations. Leveraging such a globally-relevant and emerging domain would enrich the innovation narrative, differentiate the work from other LLM-human-in-the-loop systems, and establish compelling pathways for real-world high-impact deployments. This global extension aligns well with the participatory and ethical design principles already central to the method and would create avenues for collaboration with urban informatics researchers, strengthening the proposal’s novelty and scope. Including this integration as a secondary use case or extended future direction would address competitiveness concerns and amplify both perceived and actual impact potential.\n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"
