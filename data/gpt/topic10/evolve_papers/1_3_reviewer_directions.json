    "title": "Causal Explainability-Driven Deep Models to Eliminate 'Clever Hans' Bias in Landslide Prediction",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current deep models risk relying on spurious correlations rather than causal environmental factors, reducing reliability and interpretability of landslide predictions.",
    "Motivation": "Targets internal gap involving misuse of explainable AI where models capture non-causal patterns ('Clever Hans effect'). Introduces causal inference principles in explainability to reinforce trustworthiness and scientific validity of predictions—a novel fusion bridging causal modeling and deep learning for environmental hazards.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Incorporate causal graph priors derived from domain experts into model training via a constrained optimization framework that penalizes attribution to non-causal features identified by causal discovery algorithms. Integrate counterfactual reasoning modules that test model predictions under hypothetical environmental perturbations, supported by advanced explainability techniques such as causal SHAP variants.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct causal graphs of environmental factors influencing landslides using domain knowledge and data-driven discovery. 2) Train deep networks with causal priors enforcing focus on causally relevant features. 3) Validate using both predictive metrics and measures of causal alignment. 4) Perform counterfactual simulation tests to verify model behavior. 5) Compare with unconstrained deep models and standard explainability methods.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Remote sensing data with known causal factors (e.g., soil saturation, slope angle). Output: Landslide prediction with attribution maps highlighting only causal drivers; counterfactual tests showing prediction changes consistent with causal logic.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If causal constraints degrade performance, refine causal graphs iteratively with expert feedback or relax constraints gradually. Employ alternative causal regularization such as independent causal mechanisms principles."

          "feedback_content": "While the method promisingly integrates causal graph priors and counterfactual reasoning, the proposal lacks clarity on the concrete implementation details of the constrained optimization framework. Specifically, how causal discovery outputs translate into actionable constraints and how these interact with explainability techniques like causal SHAP variants are insufficiently detailed. Elaboration on the algorithmic steps, model architecture modifications, and potential computational costs will strengthen soundness and reproducibility claims, enabling clearer validation of the causal enforcement mechanism within deep models for landslide prediction. Including illustrative pseudo-code or flow diagrams would be beneficial for reviewers and practitioners to assess the method’s technical feasibility and soundness more rigorously within the complex domain of environmental hazards prediction and explainability fusion techniques.\n\nHence, please provide a more in-depth elaboration on the mechanism of injecting causal graph priors into the training process, the formulation of the constrained optimization, and the role and integration of counterfactual reasoning modules in the model’s inference pipeline, with justification of each component's theoretical and practical feasibility within deep learning frameworks for geospatial data analysis.\n\nThis enhancement will address current ambiguity and clarify the proposal’s methodological soundness and potential for successful implementation within a deep learning context integrating causal inference and explainability, critically important in an area with strong existing works that require rigor to advance the state-of-the-art effectively."

Specifically, expanding the proposed method to not only focus on causal correctness but also on developing explainability that fosters stakeholder trust—including policymakers, local communities, and environmental scientists—could significantly amplify impact.\n\nConcretely, augment the framework to incorporate human-in-the-loop validation processes or participatory causal graph refinement, and address ethical questions around transparency and accountability in landslide prediction. This could further include uncertainty communication aligned with causal attributions and decision-making consequences. Embedding such human-centered, ethical AI aspects could differentiate this work sharply from prior art, broadening its scientific and societal relevance as well as publication competitiveness in premier venues concerned with combining AI rigor and societal impacts."
