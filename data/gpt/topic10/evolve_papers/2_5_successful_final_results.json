    "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM bias audits lack granular interpretation of how roles and character archetypes influence embedded biases in text generation, limiting actionable insights for mitigation.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external gap linking theater role understanding ('Princess','Willy Loman') with bias interpretability by using narrative archetypal role detection as a tool for bias auditing.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an automatic narrative role detection system identifying archetypical roles in generated outputs (hero, victim, villain). Cross-reference these with known bias patterns (e.g., stereotyping of certain demographics) to pinpoint role-based bias manifestations. Use this audit to guide targeted bias reduction interventions in model fine-tuning.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compile annotated datasets with labeled narrative roles and demographic attributes. 2) Train classifiers for role recognition in generated text. 3) Evaluate correlation between role assignment and bias metrics. 4) Perform bias correction using role-sensitive fine-tuning and re-evaluate.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Generated story with a female character cast as 'damsel in distress.' Detection highlights stereotypical role bias prompting corrective response generation minimizing stereotype reinforcement.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If role detection accuracy is low, utilize crowd-annotated narrative role datasets or transfer learning from literary analysis models. Alternatively, incorporate sentiment and framing analysis as proxies."

        "title": "Operationalized Narrative Role Taxonomy for Granular Bias Auditing in LLM Outputs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current bias audits of large language models (LLMs) inadequately capture the nuanced influence of narrative roles and archetypes on embedded biases within generated text, largely due to vague role definitions and insufficiently articulated detection mechanisms. This gap impedes actionable insights required for precise bias mitigation.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work recognizes stereotypical role biases tied to social groups in LLM outputs, existing methods lack an explicit, operationalized framework that anchors narrative role detection within a rigorous, computational pipeline. By formalizing a culturally-informed narrative role taxonomy and linking it to measurable bias dimensions using explainable classifiers, this research advances beyond heuristic-driven audits to produce reproducible, interpretable insights. Integrating knowledge from intelligent information systems and public policy decision support, this approach also enables informed bias interventions aligned with trustworthy information standards, asserting a novel synthesis in the bias auditing landscape.",
        "Proposed_Method": "The approach entails developing a robust computational pipeline for narrative role-based bias auditing grounded in three key components: (1) a formalized, multi-dimensional narrative role taxonomy—defining roles such as 'hero', 'victim', 'villain' along with culturally variable archetypes—constructed through synthesis of literary scholarship (including Anglo-Saxon manuscript analyses) and contemporary social frameworks; annotated with explicit criteria addressing ambiguity and overlap. (2) An annotation protocol involving expert and crowd-sourced annotators with detailed guidelines and inter-annotator agreement metrics (Cohen's kappa ≥0.75) for narrative role labeling in LLM-generated text enriched with demographic metadata. (3) Development of deep learning classifiers leveraging transformer architectures fine-tuned on these datasets to detect roles with explainability modules (e.g., attention visualizations). Concurrently, define a theoretically grounded, metric-based mapping between detected roles and bias manifestations (e.g., stereotyping indices, sentiment skew) integrating intelligent information system analytics and project management knowledge for systematic bias pattern extraction. This linkage enables quantitative correlation and causal inference analyses. Finally, the bias audit informs targeted, role-sensitive fine-tuning interventions on LLMs. Leveraging decision support system principles from public administration, the method includes continuous evaluation with fairness metrics on held-out test sets to ensure measurable bias reduction and trustworthy output generation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Step 1: Conduct a comprehensive literature review and expert consultations (including clinical and legal professionals to ensure cross-domain relevance) to establish a culturally rich narrative role taxonomy and annotation schema that address ambiguous and overlapping roles. Step 2: Curate LLM-generated text datasets supplemented with demographic and contextual metadata. Implement a multi-phase annotation process with trained annotators and crowd workers, applying quality control (inter-annotator agreement κ≥0.75) and bias mitigation strategies (e.g., annotator diversity, blind annotation). Step 3: Train and validate transformer-based narrative role classifiers with integrated explainability, evaluating precision, recall, and F1-scores above 0.80 on validation sets. Step 4: Develop and validate a formal role-to-bias mapping schema with quantitative bias metrics (stereotype frequency, sentiment variance), applying statistical correlation and controlled experiments to isolate role effects from confounders. Step 5: Implement role-sensitive fine-tuning procedures on target LLMs informed by audit insights, guided by principles from intelligent information systems and project management frameworks to balance effectiveness and computational cost. Step 6: Rigorously evaluate bias reduction efficacy on independent test sets using standardized fairness and trustworthiness metrics, with ablation studies to confirm contribution of role-based interventions. Step 7: Document reproducible pipelines and release datasets, annotation guidelines, and code to support community validation and extension.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: Input prompt generates a story portraying a female character predominantly as a ‘damsel in distress.’ The system detects this role assignment with high confidence. Correlation metrics indicate reinforcement of gender stereotyping. The fine-tuning intervention adjusts model behavior, resulting in re-generated outputs with reduced stereotypical framing while retaining narrative coherence. Example 2: An LLM output assigns an ambiguous role to a character with cultural variations in interpretation (e.g., 'trickster'). Annotators reach high agreement aided by the formalized taxonomy. Classifier outputs explain attention weights highlighting key phrases. Bias analysis reveals subtle ethnic stereotyping linked to this role, prompting targeted mitigation. Example 3: Narrative role detection identifies a ‘villain’ archetype frequently aligned with specific demographic markers across multiple outputs. Post-intervention evaluations demonstrate statistically significant decreases in such biased alignments according to fairness metrics derived from intelligent information systems research.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If narrative role classifier performance is below targeted thresholds, strengthen annotation protocols by incorporating additional expert clinical and legal domain input to refine role definitions. Employ transfer learning from pretrained literary analysis models trained on Anglo-Saxon manuscripts and other culturally rich corpora to improve role detection robustness. Alternatively, enhance bias detection by integrating complementary analyses such as sentiment analysis, framing detection, and topic modeling as proxy signals, triangulated with partial narrative role cues. To address dataset limitations, establish partnerships with public administration entities and clinical documentation sources to augment real-world diversity, ensuring broader applicability. Adapt project management best practices to iteratively refine annotation and model training cycles based on continuous evaluation feedback."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an automatic system for detecting narrative roles to audit bias, yet lacks sufficient clarity on how exactly archetypal role detection will be operationalized within large language model outputs. It is critically important to explicitly detail the computational approach for role detection, especially how roles like 'hero', 'victim', and 'villain' will be defined, annotated, and distinguished in generated text — including mechanisms to handle ambiguous, overlapping, or culturally variable roles. Moreover, the linkage between detected roles and bias patterns requires an articulated, theoretically grounded mapping schema with metrics. Without a rigorous mechanism design addressing these aspects, the method's validity remains under-specified, risking fragility or lack of explainability in outcomes. I recommend formalizing the narrative role taxonomy, annotation standards, classifier design, and bias correlation methodology upfront to establish a sound foundation for the rest of the work. This will also guide experiment reproducibility and interpretability of results effectively. This is the priority to ensure the proposal’s core assumption that role detection can reveal actionable bias is sufficiently substantiated and not purely speculative or heuristic-driven.

          "feedback_content": "While the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines key stages, its feasibility is weakened by lack of concrete plans regarding dataset acquisition, annotation quality, and classifier validation. Compiling annotated datasets with both narrative roles and demographic attributes is non-trivial; current public corpora for narrative roles in generated text are largely unavailable or limited. The plan should explicitly include strategies for dataset sourcing, annotation protocols, inter-annotator agreement thresholds, and steps to mitigate annotator bias. Furthermore, training classifiers and evaluating correlations between roles and bias metrics requires robust experimental controls to isolate role effects from confounding factors in LLM output. The fallback plan proposing crowd annotations or transfer learning should be expanded with precise methodologies rather than high-level suggestions. Especially, fine-tuning interventions must be defined with clear evaluation metrics beyond correlation—e.g., bias reduction measurements validated on held-out test sets. Strengthening the experimental design with these specifics will enhance scientific soundness and feasibility, increasing confidence in successful demonstration and reproducibility.
