    "title": "EfficientDistill: Multi-Task Knowledge Distillation Framework for Compact NLP Dense Prediction Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Large, multi-task resource-aware Transformer models have high inference costs, yet current knowledge distillation approaches do not fully leverage multi-task signals across classification and dense prediction tasks for compact model learning.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external gap by integrating multi-task learning signals from image classification-inspired backbones and downstream dense prediction tasks into knowledge distillation frameworks to yield efficient, scalable NLP models.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop EfficientDistill, a unified multi-task knowledge distillation framework where a large teacher model trained on multiple correlated NLP tasks (classification, segmentation-like token labeling) transfers knowledge to a lightweight student model. The method incorporates task-specific hint layers and adaptive loss weighting to balance diverse objectives. The student adopts a hybrid Transformer-ConvNet backbone that exploits efficient local convolutions for feature reuse, reducing complexity.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Train a large teacher model on benchmark multi-task NLP datasets (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE, token labeling tasks).\n2. Define student architecture with hybrid efficient backbone.\n3. Perform distillation experiments, comparing to baseline student training without distillation.\n4. Evaluate on single and combined tasks, measuring model size, latency, and accuracy.\n5. Experiment with loss weighting strategies and hint layers to optimize multi-task learning.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence for sentiment classification and named entity recognition simultaneously.\nExpected Output: Compact student model predicts sentiment and entities accurately within latency bounds, outperforming baseline models of similar size.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-task distillation reduces performance on specific tasks, apply curriculum learning to progressively add tasks or revert to single-task distillation followed by fine-tuning on others."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed EfficientDistill leverages a hybrid Transformer-ConvNet backbone and task-specific hint layers with adaptive loss weighting, the mechanism explaining how these components synergistically enhance multi-task knowledge distillation remains underspecified. The proposal would benefit from a clearer architectural diagram or conceptual framework clarifying: 1) the flow and integration of multi-task signals during distillation; 2) the rationale behind the hybrid backbone choice and its direct impact on feature reuse and complexity reduction; and 3) how adaptive loss weighting dynamically balances task conflicts during training. Such clarity will strengthen confidence in the method's soundness and reproducibility, and better differentiate it from related multi-task distillation approaches in the literature. Consider including detailed mathematical formulations or algorithmic pseudo-code for key innovations to bolster understanding and rigor in the Proposed_Method section."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and the highly saturated area of multi-task distillation and compact NLP models, the idea can gain significant impact and differentiation by integrating insights from vision-language modeling and semantic alignment literature. For example, leveraging cross-modal knowledge distillation techniques from vision-language tasks or incorporating semantic alignment mechanisms between teacher and student representations could enhance knowledge transfer efficacy. Additionally, exploring deployment-oriented compression techniques in conjunction with hardware accelerators or DNN inference optimization could bolster practical relevance. Embedding such globally linked concepts would raise novelty, improve scalability across modalities, and appeal to a broader community seeking cross-domain and hardware-aware compact model solutions."
