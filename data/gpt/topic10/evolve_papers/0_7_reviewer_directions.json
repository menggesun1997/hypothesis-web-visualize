    "title": "Reinforcement Learning-Driven Ethical Compliance Optimizer for LLM Pipelines",
    "Problem_Statement": "Balancing output quality and ethical compliance dynamically in LLM-generated scientific texts remains unaddressed in adaptive pipelines.",
    "Motivation": "Targets ethical and legal gaps by formulating ethical compliance as an RL-driven optimization problem, incorporating evolving norms as dynamic rewards to guide adaptive LLM output generation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement a reinforcement learning agent that receives feedback on ethical compliance (e.g., originality, data privacy adherence) from evaluation models and optimizes LLM text generation strategies accordingly, adapting continuously to updated criteria.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Define ethical reward functions reflecting compliance metrics. 2) Simulate LLM generation under RL guidance in scientific domains. 3) Measure compliance improvement and output quality trade-offs. 4) Test adaptability to changing norm inputs.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Draft scientific abstract with sensitive data references. Output: RL-optimized abstract respecting privacy norms and originality standards while maintaining clarity.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If RL signal sparse or noisy, use reward shaping or supervised fine-tuning with ethical labels."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to optimize large language model (LLM) text generation for ethical compliance based on evolving norms as dynamic rewards. However, the mechanism by which the RL agent receives timely, accurate, and non-sparse feedback on complex ethical metrics such as originality and privacy adherence remains underspecified. More clarity is needed on how evaluation models will generate reliable reward signals that effectively guide RL-derived generation strategies without degrading linguistic quality or relevance, especially given the high dimensionality and ambiguity of ethical criteria in scientific text production. Addressing this will strengthen the proposal's soundness by concretely articulating the RL feedback loop, reward design, and mitigation strategies for noisy or delayed signals beyond the current fallback plan. Consider specifying examples of evaluation models and algorithms for reward calculation within the pipeline to increase confidence in the method's practical viability and theoretical rigor. This enhanced clarity will also facilitate reproducibility and critical assessment by the community, which is essential for pioneering RL approaches in ethical text generation pipelines. Recommendations include defining the feedback signal derivation process, specifying the RL agent's action space in LLM generation, and detailing how continuous adaptation to dynamic norms is stabilized and measured for performance and compliance trade-offs in practice. The current framework lacks these integral design details, limiting the assessment of soundness and the method's prospective success or failure modes in real-world settings.
