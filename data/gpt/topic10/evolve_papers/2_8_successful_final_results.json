        "title": "Regulatory-Aware Interactive Reinforcement Learning Interface for Bias and Security Correction in Financial LLM Applications",
        "Problem_Statement": "Bias mitigation and compliance assurance in large language model (LLM) applications for finance currently lack a rigorous, user-driven mechanism that dynamically adapts outputs based on expert corrections while simultaneously ensuring adherence to evolving AI regulations and cybersecurity standards in real-time.",
        "Motivation": "While existing bias correction research in financial LLMs focuses on static or generic human-in-the-loop approaches, they insufficiently engage domain experts to refine outputs dynamically with clear methodological rigor or incorporate the critical dimensions of regulatory compliance and cybersecurity threat detection mandated by frameworks such as the emerging AI Act in high-income countries. Our approach fills these gaps by integrating interactive reinforcement learning tightly grounded in formal algorithmic design with real-time regulatory and security-aware feedback. This system not only enhances fairness and accuracy through personalized bias filters learned from finance professionals’ corrections, but also broadens impact as a comprehensive intelligent decision-making assistant that mitigates systemic operational, legal, and security risks. This elevates novelty beyond prior work by fusing advanced AI techniques with financial critical infrastructure protection principles, creating an operationally robust platform for real-world adoption.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel interactive framework that tightly integrates reinforcement learning (RL), regulatory compliance monitoring, and cybersecurity threat detection into a unified bias and safety correction interface tailored for financial LLMs. The method’s core RL mechanism models user interaction as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where:\n\n- State space encodes the current LLM-generated output features, user expertise profile, historical correction patterns, compliance status, and cybersecurity anomaly indicators derived from real-time monitoring modules.\n- Action space includes parameter adjustments to the LLM output distribution, bias filter weights, and triggering compliance/security alerts or output modifications.\n- Reward function explicitly balances reductions in user-flagged biases, compliance violation detections (guided by an AI compliance rulebase derived from the AI Act and financial regulations), and identified cybersecurity risks, while penalizing maladaptive changes or exploitative user corrections.\n\nWe instantiate the RL agent using a recurrent neural network architecture capable of modeling temporal user interaction dynamics and output dependencies, trained with proximal policy optimization (PPO) to ensure stable learning from noisy corrections. Corrections from finance professionals—bias flags, compliance issue marks, or security anomaly flags—are translated into quantitative learning signals via a designed feedback encoding schema that maps human inputs to reward shaping and state updates. An information fusion layer aggregates multi-source inputs from LLM outputs, compliance monitoring tools, and threat detection modules to contextualize learning and enable nuanced decision-making. Real-time threat detection leverages advanced cybersecurity frameworks to identify insecure output patterns or anomalous linguistic constructs potentially indicative of adversarial or faulty generation. Users receive transparent feedback on bias reduction, compliance alignment, and security status, fostering trust and collaborative system evolution.\n\nThe system explicitly models assumptions about user reliability, expertise variability, and imperfect feedback through robust reward clipping and experience replay buffers that mitigate overfitting to noisy or malicious inputs. Modular design enables toggling online RL with fallback to batch semi-supervised retraining, preserving stability in critical financial workflows. This comprehensive design substantially surpasses existing methods by combining interactive bias correction with formal regulation and cybersecurity-aware decision-making, crucial for safe financial AI deployment.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop the interactive interface embedding feedback capture modules for bias, compliance, and security flags from finance domain experts.\n2) Curate a comprehensive dataset of LLM outputs with annotations on bias, regulatory compliance violations (linked to AI Act criteria), and cybersecurity anomalies.\n3) Implement the RL agent with recurrent neural network policy and PPO training pipeline, integrating real-time information fusion from LLM, compliance rule-based evaluation, and threat detection outputs.\n4) Conduct iterative simulation studies to verify system responsiveness to user corrections and stability against noisy feedback.\n5) Deploy pilot studies with finance professionals in controlled environments to assess improvements in output fairness, compliance adherence, security robustness, and user trust across multiple sessions.\n6) Quantitatively evaluate using metrics such as bias reduction indices, compliance violation rates, false positive/negative rates in threat detection, user satisfaction scores, and system adaptability measures.\n7) Perform ablation experiments to isolate contributions of RL personalization, compliance checking, and security modules.\n8) Analyze scalability and robustness in realistic financial workflows to validate deployment feasibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "1) Input: Investment advice with embedded gender bias risk profiling; user flags gender bias; the RL-based system adjusts internal bias filters and output distributions, reducing biased language and risk estimates in subsequent outputs.\n2) Input: Generated financial forecast containing terminology or suggestions violating AI Act transparency or fairness mandates; system detects compliance breach via integrated rule base, alerts user, and modifies outputs to align with regulations.\n3) Input: LLM output exhibiting suspicious anomalous patterns indicating possible cybersecurity risk, such as insecure data exposure or adversarially triggered hallucination; threat detection module flags the anomaly, the interface notifies the user, and the RL agent learns to avoid generating similar patterns.\n\nIn all cases, the system dynamically integrates user corrections and detected violations to refine outputs in real-time, aligning with user expertise and regulatory/security constraints.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the online reinforcement learning proves unstable or impractical in high-stakes financial environments, we will default to a batch retraining approach: aggregating and sanitizing user corrections, compliance and security feedback over defined intervals and applying semi-supervised learning and policy fine-tuning to update bias filters and output adjustment parameters offline. Additionally, a rule-based safeguard layer will enforce critical compliance and security constraints as a backstop, ensuring no unsafe outputs propagate. Planned user studies will evaluate usability and safety trade-offs between online and offline learning modes, enabling adaptive deployment strategies tailored to organizational risk tolerance."

          "feedback_content": "The mechanism by which reinforcement learning will personalize bias filters and dynamically adapt outputs requires clearer elaboration. Details such as the state and action spaces, reward formulation capturing user intent and bias reduction, and how user corrections translate into learning signals are not specified. This clarity is crucial to evaluate the soundness and implementability of the method effectively. Consider specifying the RL architecture or algorithmic approach and how it interoperates with the language model outputs in real-time to ensure the method is rigorous and well-founded in theory and practice, not just conceptually attractive but also operationally feasible and robust against noisy corrections or malicious inputs, especially in high-stakes financial contexts where trust and correctness are fundamental. This will also help clarify underlying assumptions about user behavior and system adaptability inherent to the proposed interactive correction framework in the finance domain, thus reducing risk and increasing confidence in the proposed system's effectiveness and scalability in real financial workflows, beyond just a prototype or pilot setting.  This is a critical step before moving into experimentation and deployment phases, as it directly affects the system's performance and user trust, which are core to the research contribution and impact claims made in your proposal.  Please elaborate on the RL-based mechanism with technical depth in the 'Proposed_Method' section to strengthen soundness and credibility of the approach overall.  This enhancement will also inform more focused experiment designs and evaluation metrics aligned with the claimed benefits of trust-building and bias mitigation through interactive corrections by finance experts, thereby sharpening the distinct novelty claim beyond existing human-in-the-loop learning literature for bias correction in LLMs within finance or similar domains.  Detailed algorithmic clarity is therefore essential for reviewers and practitioners to fully assess and reproduce your methodological contributions and build upon them in future work, mitigating the current risk of ambiguity or overgeneralization inherent from the high-level description provided currently.  This is the highest priority refinement needed to advance the research idea to a competitive and impactful stage suitable for premier conference acceptance and real-world adoption potential.  Addressing this will also help delineate limitations and assumptions explicitly, enabling a more nuanced discussion of feasibility and expected outcomes under different user interaction scenarios, which appears currently lacking but crucial for the interactive bias correction paradigm you propose."

          "feedback_content": "Given the 'NOV-COMPETITIVE' novelty verdict and the presence of globally linked concepts like 'AI Act', 'cybersecurity framework', and 'intelligent decision-making', a concrete suggestion is to integrate regulatory compliance and security-aware feedback into the interactive bias correction system. Specifically, extend the interface to incorporate real-time checks against financial AI regulations (e.g., transparency and fairness requirements mandated by the emerging AI Act in high-income countries) and detect security-related anomalies in generated outputs. This could involve fusing information from an AI compliance rule base and cybersecurity threat detection modules to not only correct biases but also ensure outputs meet legal and security standards dynamically. Leveraging 'information fusion techniques' and 'real-time threat detection' concepts within the feedback mechanism would substantially broaden both novelty and impact. This integration could empower finance professionals to correct not only bias but also flag outputs violating compliance or security policies, making the system a comprehensive intelligent decision-making assistant aligned with critical infrastructure protection requirements in financial services. Such an approach elevates the research beyond current human-in-the-loop bias correction, positioning it as a systemic risk mitigation tool for finance LLMs subject to regulatory and security constraints, thus carving a distinct and highly relevant research niche with strong multidisciplinary appeal for top-tier venues."
