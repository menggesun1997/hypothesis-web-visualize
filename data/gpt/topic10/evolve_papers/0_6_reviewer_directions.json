          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method aims to adapt multi-level sequence comparison methods from bioinformatics for lexical, semantic, and factual evaluation of LLM outputs in scientific texts. However, the mechanism lacks detailed articulation regarding how traditional bioinformatics techniques like sequence alignment and graph alignment maps concretely onto textual semantic and factual layers. There is an absence of clear definitions for these layers, how alignment scores will be computed, and how external knowledge bases will be integrated into network-based factual validation. Providing precise methodological steps, algorithmic adaptations, and examples of metric computations will strengthen the clarity and robustness of the proposal's core mechanism. This will also aid reproducibility and feasibility evaluation by reviewers and practitioners alike. Consider including formal problem definitions and pseudocode or flow diagrams for the multi-level evaluation pipeline to improve soundness and clarity of the approach within the Proposed_Method section."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment, it is crucial to leverage globally linked concepts to differentiate this work further. Incorporating recent advances in Transformer-based language models and neural network learning methods could enhance the proposed evaluation suite's capability to model semantic fidelity and contextualized factual consistency more effectively. Specifically, integrating pretrained models like Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) or other state-of-the-art baselines for zero-shot or few-shot semantic assessment, combined with knowledge graph-based medical or biomedical resources (e.g., Chinese medical knowledge graph or medical knowledge graphs), could significantly improve evaluation accuracy and scalability. Such integration can also address citation contexts and quotation errors, enhancing scientific NLP text evaluation impact in healthcare and biomedical domains. Emphasizing these connections and experimenting with such integrations in the experimental plan can elevate the work's novelty and practical impact substantially."
