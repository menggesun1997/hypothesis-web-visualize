    "title": "Ethical Authorship Attribution Module for AI-Augmented Scientific Publications",
    "Problem_Statement": "Ambiguities around authorship attribution and copyright in AI-assisted scientific writing lead to ethical uncertainty and legal challenges.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the ethical and legal gaps by designing a dynamic module that tracks and transparently reports AI contributions to scientific texts, inspired by IT service transparency frameworks, fostering accountability and compliance.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement an integrated metadata-aware pipeline extension that logs generative actions, contribution weights, and provenance of AI-assisted components in research manuscripts. Employ blockchain-inspired immutable ledgers to certify and authenticate AI-human co-authorship trails.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Prototype metadata tracking in existing LLM writing tools. 2) Develop blockchain ledger system for immutable record keeping. 3) Test on multi-author scientific drafts with varying AI assistance levels. 4) Collect user feedback on transparency and trust improvements.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Research article draft edited partially by AI suggestions. Expected output: Authorship report detailing human vs AI input fractions with cryptographic proofs, accessible to publishers and reviewers.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If full blockchain integration proves impractical, fallback to secure centralized logging with tamper-evident timestamps and role-based access controls."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposal to use blockchain-inspired immutable ledgers for certifying AI-human co-authorship trails is innovative, the mechanism lacks sufficient technical clarity and justification in the Proposed_Method section. It is unclear how the blockchain ledger will integrate with existing metadata pipelines, the expected overhead, and how cryptographic proofs will be generated and verified in practice. The proposal would benefit from a more detailed architectural design outlining the data flow, security assumptions, and how the ledger achieves transparency without compromising privacy or usability for authors and reviewers. Additionally, the scalability and interoperability considerations should be addressed explicitly to ensure real-world applicability in diverse publication workflows, including multi-author and multi-institution scenarios. Clarifying these points will strengthen the soundness and practical viability of the method's mechanism by making the technical foundation more explicit and grounded in implementation realities, reducing uncertainty about how the proposed system functions end-to-end and can be trusted by stakeholders.\" ,\"target_section\":\"Proposed_Method\"},{"

          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screened novelty competitiveness, a promising direction to enhance both impact and novelty is to integrate forensic analysis techniques from 'forensic psychiatry' and 'criminal justice' fields to augment the module's integrity verification. Specifically, employing stylometric or linguistic fingerprinting methods, which are used to detect authorship and authenticity in forensic contexts, could complement the metadata tracking and blockchain mechanisms. This hybrid approach could robustly detect subtle AI-generated contributions or manipulations that metadata alone might miss, thereby enhancing ethical accountability and trustworthiness in AI-augmented scientific publishing. Leveraging such cross-disciplinary methods would deepen the technical foundation, diversify evaluation metrics, and appeal to broader communities concerned with AI ethics and legal compliance in publishing, hence elevating the idea's overall novelty and impact potential.\" ,\"target_section\":\"Proposed_Method\"}]}  This final output strictly adheres to your requested format, selecting two critical points: improving the technical clarity of the blockchain mechanism and suggesting integration with forensic authorship analysis for stronger impact and novelty.
