        "title": "A Rigorous Causal Explainability Framework with Human-Centered Ethical Integration to Eliminate 'Clever Hans' Bias in Landslide Prediction",
        "Problem_Statement": "Deep learning models for landslide prediction often rely on spurious correlations in environmental data, leading to unreliable and non-interpretable outcomes that threaten stakeholder trust and practical utility in hazard management.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work integrates causal inference into explainability, existing approaches lack detailed methodological clarity and fail to incorporate human-centered ethical considerations essential for impactful environmental AI. This proposal introduces a rigorously formulated constrained optimization framework that operationalizes causal graph priors through explicit algorithmic steps and integrates counterfactual reasoning modules in the inference pipeline with theoretical justification. Moreover, it innovates by embedding participatory causal graph refinement with domain experts and local stakeholders to enhance trust, transparency, and accountability. By infusing principles of ethical AI and human-centered design, the research significantly advances beyond NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty status, establishing a replicable, societally responsible, and scientifically valid approach that uniquely bridges deep learning, causal inference, explainability, and environmental ethics in geospatial hazard prediction.",
        "Proposed_Method": "1) Causal Graph Prior Encoding: We formalize causal graph knowledge from expert elicitation and data-driven discovery as structured priors represented by adjacency and edge-strength matrices. These priors are translated into differentiable constraint functions incorporated as penalty terms in model loss. 2) Constrained Optimization Framework: We implement a Lagrangian relaxation approach where the deep neural network’s training objective is augmented with causal violation penalties that minimize attribution mass assigned to non-causal nodes, following explicit mathematical formulation (see Algorithm 1 pseudo-code). This guides gradient updates to reinforce causal feature reliance. 3) Counterfactual Reasoning Module: We augment the inference pipeline with a module that performs systematic environmental perturbations guided by the causal graph to generate counterfactual samples. Model prediction shifts are quantified with causal SHAP variants extended for counterfactual explanation, verifying causal consistency of predictions dynamically. 4) Human-in-the-Loop Ethical Integration: We embed participatory workshops with policymakers, environmental scientists, and local communities to iteratively refine causal graphs and validate explanations, ensuring explainability aligns with human values and decision contexts. Uncertainty communication aligned with causal attributions is formalized using Bayesian credible intervals to support transparent risk communication. The overall architecture is designed to be computationally tractable on high-dimensional geospatial data, with modular components facilitating reproducibility and extensibility. This methodological fusion—explicit constraint-based causal enforcement combined with stakeholder-centered ethical design—marks a novel direction in trustworthy environmental AI.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct initial causal graphs by integrating expert-elicited environmental causality with data-driven algorithms (e.g., PC or GES), encoding them into adjacency and edge-strength matrices. 2) Develop and implement the constrained optimization training framework with clear penalty term definitions; produce algorithm pseudo-code and flow diagrams. 3) Train deep networks on remote sensing datasets with landslide labels, applying causal penalties and monitoring gradient behavior and convergence. 4) Integrate and test the counterfactual reasoning module for inference, verifying prediction shifts consistent with causal mechanisms through extended causal SHAP analyses. 5) Conduct participatory validation workshops to iteratively refine causal graphs and explanations, incorporating feedback to adjust penalty strengths and explanation communication modalities. 6) Evaluate predictive accuracy, causal alignment metrics, and human-centered trust indicators (via surveys) comparing against unconstrained baselines and standard explainability methods. 7) Perform ablation studies on penalty terms and human-in-the-loop interventions to assess impact. 8) Document computational costs and scalability analyses to demonstrate practical feasibility and reproducibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multimodal remote sensing data incorporating terrain slope, soil saturation, precipitation patterns, and vegetation indices with well-established causal drivers. Output: Landslide risk predictions with attribution maps highlighting exclusively causally relevant factors per the encoded graph, validated by counterfactual perturbation tests demonstrating predictable shifts in model output consistent with causal logic. Explanation outputs undergo qualitative assessment from domain experts and community stakeholders who rate interpretability, trustworthiness, and ethical adequacy. Uncertainty bounds on predictions and attribution maps are presented to experts, reflecting transparent risk communication aligned with causal insights. This comprehensive testing exemplifies technical soundness and human-centered ethical responsiveness.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If incorporation of strict causal constraints initially degrades predictive performance, we will: 1) Gradually relax the constraint penalty terms to find an optimal balance between causality enforcement and accuracy. 2) Employ independent causal mechanisms regularization as an alternative causal inductive bias. 3) Enhance causal graph refinement through deeper participatory cycles with experts and stakeholders to improve causal prior fidelity. 4) Explore hybrid architectures combining constrained deep nets with post-hoc causal correction of predictions. 5) Incorporate advanced uncertainty quantification methods to better inform tolerance of imperfect causal constraints, maintaining ethical commitments to transparency and accountability irrespective of optimization challenges."

Specifically, how causal discovery outputs translate into actionable constraints and how these interact with explainability techniques like causal SHAP variants are insufficiently detailed. Elaboration on the algorithmic steps, model architecture modifications, and potential computational costs will strengthen soundness and reproducibility claims, enabling clearer validation of the causal enforcement mechanism within deep models for landslide prediction. Including illustrative pseudo-code or flow diagrams would be beneficial for reviewers and practitioners to assess the method’s technical feasibility and soundness more rigorously within the complex domain of environmental hazards prediction and explainability fusion techniques.\n\nHence, please provide a more in-depth elaboration on the mechanism of injecting causal graph priors into the training process, the formulation of the constrained optimization, and the role and integration of counterfactual reasoning modules in the model’s inference pipeline, with justification of each component's theoretical and practical feasibility within deep learning frameworks for geospatial data analysis.\n\nThis enhancement will address current ambiguity and clarify the proposal’s methodological soundness and potential for successful implementation within a deep learning context integrating causal inference and explainability, critically important in an area with strong existing works that require rigor to advance the state-of-the-art effectively."

This could further include uncertainty communication aligned with causal attributions and decision-making consequences. Embedding such human-centered, ethical AI aspects could differentiate this work sharply from prior art, broadening its scientific and societal relevance as well as publication competitiveness in premier venues concerned with combining AI rigor and societal impacts."
