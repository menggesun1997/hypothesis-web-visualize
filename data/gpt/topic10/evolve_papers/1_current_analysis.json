We categorize deep learning tasks into five key frameworks—classification, detection, segmentation, sequence, and the hybrid framework—and analyze their specific applications in landslide-related tasks. Following the presented frameworks, we review state-or-art studies and provide clear insights into the powerful capability of deep learning models for landslide detection, mapping, susceptibility mapping, and displacement prediction. We then discuss current challenges and future research directions, emphasizing areas like model generalizability and advanced network architectures. Aimed at serving both newcomers and experts on remote sensing and engineering geology, this review highlights the potential of deep learning in advancing landslide risk management and preservation.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Landslide detection, monitoring and prediction with remote-sensing techniques', 'abstract': 'Landslides are widespread occurrences that can become catastrophic when they occur near settlements and infrastructure. Detection, monitoring and prediction are fundamental to managing landslide risks and often rely on remote-sensing techniques (RSTs) that include the observation of Earth from space, laser scanning and ground-based interferometry. In this Technical Review, we describe the use of RSTs in landslide analysis and management. Satellite RSTs are used to detect and measure landslide displacement, providing a synoptic view over various spatiotemporal scales. Ground-based sensors (including ground-based interferometric radar, Doppler radar and lidar) monitor smaller areas, but combine accuracy, high acquisition frequency and configuration flexibility, and are therefore increasingly used in real-time monitoring and early warning of landslides. Each RST has advantages and limitations that depend on the application (detection, monitoring or prediction), the size of the area of concern, the type of landslide, deformation pattern and risks posed by landslide. The integration of various technologies is, therefore, often best. More effective landslide risk management requires greater leveraging of big data, more strategic use of monitoring resources and better communication with residents of landslide-prone areas.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Landslide response to climate change in permafrost regions', 'abstract': 'Rapid permafrost thaw in the high-latitude and high-elevation areas increases hillslope susceptibility to landsliding by altering geotechnical properties of hillslope materials, including reduced cohesion and increased hydraulic connectivity. This review synthesizes the fundamental processes that will increase landslide frequency and magnitude in permafrost regions in the coming decades with observational and analytical studies that document landslide regimes at high latitudes and elevations. We synthesize the available literature to address five questions of practical importance, which can be used to evaluate fundamental knowledge of landslide process and inform land management decisions to mitigate geohazards and environmental impacts. After permafrost thaws, we predict that landslides will be driven primarily by atmospheric input of moisture and freeze-thaw fracturing rather than responding to disconnected and perched groundwater, melting permafrost ice, and a plane of weakness between ground ice and the active layer. Transition between equilibrium states is likely to increase landslide frequency and magnitude, alter dominant failure styles, and mobilize carbon over timescales ranging from seasons to centuries. We also evaluate potential implications of increased landslide activity on local nutrient and sediment connectivity, atmospheric carbon feedbacks, and hazards to people and infrastructure. Last, we suggest three key areas for future research to produce primary data and analysis that will fill gaps in the existing understanding of landslide regimes in permafrost regions. These suggestions include 1) expand the geographic extent of English-language research on landslides in permafrost; 2) maintain or initiate long-term monitoring projects and aerial data collection; and 3) quantify the net effect on the terrestrial carbon budget.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Climate Change 2013 – The Physical Science Basis', 'abstract': 'This latest Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will again form the standard scientific reference for all those concerned with climate change and its consequences, including students and researchers in environmental science, meteorology, climatology, biology, ecology and atmospheric chemistry.

Similarly, it is likely that climatic changes affect frequency and magnitude of mass movements, such as shallow landslides, debris flows, rock slope failures, or ice avalanches. However, so far changes in mass-movement activity can hardly be detected in observational records. In this progress report we document the role of climate variability and change on mass-movement processes in mountains through the description and analysis of selected, recent mass movements where effects of global warming and the occurrence of heavy precipitation are thought to have contributed to, or triggered, events. In addition, we assess possible effects of future climatic changes on the incidence of mass-movement processes. The report concentrates on high-mountain systems, including processes such as glacier downwasting and the formation of new ice-marginal lakes, glacier debuttressing and the occurrence of rock slope instability, temperature increase and permafrost degradation, as well as on changing sediment reservoirs and sediment supply, with a clear focus on studies from the European Alps.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Landslide failures detection and mapping using Synthetic Aperture Radar: Past, present and future', 'abstract': 'Landslides are geomorphological processes that shape the landscapes of all continents, dismantling mountains and contributing sediments to the river networks. Caused by geophysical and meteorological triggers, including intense or prolonged rainfall, seismic shaking, volcanic activity, and rapid snow melting, landslides pose a serious threat to people, property, and the environment in many areas. Given their abundance and relevance, investigators have long experimented with techniques and tools for landslide detection and mapping using primarily aerial and satellite optical imagery interpreted visually, or processed by semi-automatic or automatic procedures or algorithms. Optical (passive) sensors have known limitations due to their inability to capture Earth surface images through the clouds and to work in the absence of daylight. The alternatives are active, “all-weather” and “day-and-night”, microwave radar sensors capable of seeing through the clouds and working in presence and absence of daylight. We review the literature on the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery to detect and map landslide failures – i.e., the single most significant movement episodes in the history of a landslide – and of landslide failure events – i.e., populations of landslides in areas ranging from a few to several thousand square kilometres caused by a single trigger. We examine 54 articles published in representative journals presenting 147 case studies in 32 nations, in all continents, except Antarctica. Analysis of the geographical location of 70 study areas shows that SAR imagery was used to detect and map landslides in most morphological, geological, seismic, meteorological, climate, and land cover settings. The time history of the case studies reveals the increasing interest of the investigators in the use of SAR imagery for landslide detection and mapping, with less than one article per year from 1995 to 2011, rising to about 5 articles per year between 2012 and 2020, and an average period of about 4.2\\xa0years between the launch of a satellite and the publication of an article using imagery taken by the satellite. To detect and map landslides, investigators use a common framework that exploits the phase and the amplitude of the electromagnetic return signal recorded in the SAR images, to measure terrain surface properties and their changes. To discriminate landslides from the surrounding stable terrain, a classification of the ground properties is executed by expert visual (heuristic) interpretation, or through numerical (statistical) modelling approaches. Despite undisputed progress over the last 26\\xa0years, challenges remain to be faced for the effective use of SAR imagery for landslide detection and mapping. In the article, we examine the theoretical, research, and operational frameworks for the exploitation of SAR images for landslide detection and mapping, and we provide a perspective for future applications considering the existing and the planned SAR satellite missions.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Surface deformation due to shear and tensile faults in a half-space', 'abstract': 'Abstract\\n                  A complete suite of closed analytical expressions is presented for the surface displacements, strains, and tilts due to inclined shear and tensile faults in a half-space for both point and finite rectangular sources. These expressions are particularly compact and free from field singular points which are inherent in the previously stated expressions of certain cases. The expressions derived here represent powerful tools not only for the analysis of static field changes associated with earthquake occurrence but also for the modeling of deformation fields arising from fluid-driven crack sources.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Space-time landslide predictive modelling', 'abstract': 'Landslides are nearly ubiquitous phenomena and pose severe threats to people, properties, and the environment in many areas. Investigators have for long attempted to estimate landslide hazard in an effort to determine where, when (or how frequently), and how large (or how destructive) landslides are expected to be in an area. This information may prove useful to design landslide mitigation strategies, and to reduce landslide risk and societal and economic losses. In the geomorphology literature, most of the attempts at predicting the occurrence of populations of landslides by adopting statistical approaches are based on the empirical observation that landslides occur as a result of multiple, interacting, conditioning and triggering factors. Based on this observation, and under the assumption that at the spatial and temporal scales of our investigation individual landslides are discrete “point” events in the landscape, we propose a Bayesian modelling framework for the prediction of the spatio-temporal occurrence of landslides of the slide type caused by weather triggers. We build our modelling effort on a Log-Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP) by assuming that individual landslides in an area are the result of a point process described by an unknown intensity function. The modelling framework has two stochastic components: (i) a Poisson component, which models the observed (random) landslide count in each terrain subdivision for a given landslide “intensity”, i.e., the expected number of landslides per terrain subdivision (which may be transformed into a corresponding landslide “susceptibility”); and (ii) a Gaussian component, used to account for the spatial distribution of the local environmental conditions that influence landslide occurrence, and for the spatio-temporal distribution of “unobserved” latent environmental controls on landslide occurrence. We tested our prediction framework in the Collazzone area, Umbria, Central Italy, for which a detailed multi-temporal landslide inventory covering the period from before 1941 to 2014 is available together with lithological and bedding data. We subdivided the 79 km2 area into 889 slope units (SUs). In each SU, we computed the mean and standard deviation of 16 morphometric covariates derived from a 10 m × 10 m digital elevation model. For 13 lithological and bedding attitude covariates obtained from a 1:10,000 scale geological map, we computed the proportion of each thematic class intersecting the given SU. We further counted how many of the 3,379 landslides in the multi-temporal inventory affect each SU and grouped them into six periods. We used this complex space-time information to prepare five models of increasing complexity. Our “baseline” model (Mod1) carries the spatial information only through the covariates mentioned above. It does not include any additional information about the spatial and temporal structure of the data, and it is therefore equivalent to the predominantly used landslide susceptibility model in the literature. The second model (Mod2) is analogous, but it allows for time-interval-specific regression constants. Our next two models are more complex. In particular, our third model (Mod3) also accounts for latent spatial dependencies among neighboring SUs. These are inferred for each of the six time intervals, to explain variations in the landslide intensity and susceptibility not explained by the thematic covariates. By contrast, our fourth model (Mod4) accounts for the latent temporal dependence, separately for each SU, disregarding neighboring influences. Ultimately, our most complex model (Mod5) contextually features all these relations. It contains the information carried by morphometric and thematic covariates, six time-interval-specific regression constants, and it also accounts for the latent temporal effects between consecutive slope instabilities at specific SUs as well as the latent spatial effects between adjacent SUs. We also show that the intensity is strongly related to the aggregated landslide area per SU. Because of this, our most complex model largely fulfills the definition of landslide hazard commonly accepted in the literature, at least for this study area. We quantified the spatial predictive performance of each of the five models using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure, and the temporal predictive performance using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. We found that Mod5 performed better than the others. We then used it to test a novel strategy to classify the model results in terms of both landslide intensity and susceptibility, which provides more information than traditional susceptibility zonations for land planning and management—hereafter we use the term “traditional” simply to refer to the majority of modelling procedures in the literature. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the new modelling framework, and its potential application in other areas, making specific and general hazard and geomorphological considerations. We also give a perspective on possible developments in landslide prediction modelling and zoning. We expect our novel approach to the spatio-temporal prediction of landslides to enhance the currently limited ability to evaluate landslide hazard and its temporal and spatial variations. We further expect it to lead to better projections of future landslides, and to improve our collective understanding of the evolution of complex landscapes dominated by mass-wasting processes under multiple geophysical and weather triggers.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Insights into geospatial heterogeneity of landslide susceptibility based on the SHAP-XGBoost model', 'abstract': 'The spatial heterogeneity of landslide influencing factors is the main reason for the poor generalizability of the susceptibility evaluation model. This study aimed to construct a comprehensive explanatory framework for landslide susceptibility evaluation models based on the SHAP (SHapley Additive explanation)-XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm, analyze the regional characteristics and spatial heterogeneity of landslide influencing factors, and discuss the heterogeneity of the generalizability of the models under different landscapes. Firstly, we selected different regions in typical mountainous hilly region and constructed a geospatial database containing 12 landslide influencing factors such as elevation, annual average rainfall, slope, lithology, and NDVI through field surveys, satellite images, and a literature review. Subsequently, the landslide susceptibility evaluation model was constructed based on the XGBoost algorithm and spatial database, and the prediction results of the landslide susceptibility evaluation model were explained based on regional topography, geology, and hydrology using the SHAP algorithm. Finally, the model was generalized and applied to regions with both similar and very different topography, geology, meteorology, and vegetation, to explore the spatial heterogeneity of the generalizability of the model. The following conclusions were drawn: the spatial distribution of landslides is heterogeneous and complex, and the contribution of each influencing factor on the occurrence of landslides has obvious regional characteristics and spatial heterogeneity. The generalizability of the landslide susceptibility evaluation model is spatially heterogeneous and has better generalizability to regions with similar regional characteristics. Further explanation of the XGBoost landslide susceptibility evaluation model using the SHAP method allows quantitative analysis of the differences in how much various factors contribute to disasters due to spatial heterogeneity, from the perspective of global and local evaluation units. In summary, the integrated explanatory framework based on the SHAP-XGBoost model can quantify the contribution of influencing factors on landslide occurrence at both global and local levels, which is conducive to the construction and improvement of the influencing factor system of landslide susceptibility in different regions. It can also provide a reference for predicting potential landslide hazard-prone areas and for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) research.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Unmasking Clever Hans predictors and assessing what machines really learn', 'abstract': 'Current learning machines have successfully solved hard application problems, reaching high accuracy and displaying seemingly intelligent behavior. Here we apply recent techniques for explaining decisions of state-of-the-art learning machines and analyze various tasks from computer vision and arcade games. This showcases a spectrum of problem-solving behaviors ranging from naive and short-sighted, to well-informed and strategic. We observe that standard performance evaluation metrics can be oblivious to distinguishing these diverse problem solving behaviors. Furthermore, we propose our semi-automated Spectral Relevance Analysis that provides a practically effective way of characterizing and validating the behavior of nonlinear learning machines. This helps to assess whether a learned model indeed delivers reliably for the problem that it was conceived for. Furthermore, our work intends to add a voice of caution to the ongoing excitement about machine intelligence and pledges to evaluate and judge some of these recent successes in a more nuanced manner.'}]\n```\n\n**Part A.2: The Evolution Links (Edges of the Graph):**\nThe following list defines the citation relationships between the papers in Part A.

Following earlier conventional remote sensing techniques and climate-change impact studies, state-of-the-art work focuses intensively on deep learning tasks—classification, detection, segmentation, sequence modeling—and the development of advanced network architectures tailored for landslide-related challenges. This shift is driven by recognized limitations in traditional analytical methods regarding model generalizability and accurate spatiotemporal dynamic modeling of landslide regimes, particularly in permafrost-affected regions. The central problems tackled include improving the capabilities of deep learning models for diverse landslide detection frameworks and integrating heterogeneous data sources to more accurately characterize landslide frequency and environmental response patterns. The dominant methodology evolution reflects a progression from satellite and ground-based sensor data integration to more complex, interpretable machine learning and deep learning algorithms, with a growing emphasis on explainability and spatial heterogeneity.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite progress, significant limitations exist in model generalizability across geospatial heterogeneous regions, as revealed by the SHAP-XGBoost studies. There is insufficient integration of explainable AI techniques to reliably interpret deep learning predictions, leading to potential 'Clever Hans' effects where models might rely on spurious correlations rather than causal environmental factors. Moreover, current models tend to focus heavily on spatial or temporal dimensions separately, with limited unified frameworks that capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies dynamically. Lastly, permafrost-related landslide triggering mechanisms influenced by climate change remain insufficiently modeled due to sparse observational data and inadequate long-term monitoring infrastructure. External/Novel Gaps: The global context highlights overlooked cross-disciplinary opportunities involving harmonizing deep learning advances with detailed landslide frequency and intensity modeling, especially through transfer learning strategies utilizing multi-modal rainfall, seismic, and environmental datasets. The integration of machine learning techniques common in geoinformatics with advanced time-series and probabilistic modeling (e.g., Bayesian spatial-temporal frameworks) has yet to be fully realized. There is also a notable gap in leveraging interactive explainability methods to concurrently assess model reliability and dynamic environmental factors influencing landslides, a critical area given the complexity of climate-earth system interactions.",

Integrated Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Architectures Enhanced with Explainability for Landslide Prediction: Combining Log-Gaussian Cox Processes-inspired stochastic modeling with explainable AI techniques (e.g., SHAP integrated into deep sequence models) can target the joint spatio-temporal modeling deficiency and improve trust in model predictions, particularly for dynamic landslide hazard assessment under climate change scenarios.\n\n3.
