    "Problem_Statement": "Current ethical AI benchmarks lack culturally diverse evaluative scenarios, resulting in limited assessment of LLM bias mitigation’s effectiveness across global moral frameworks.",
    "Motivation": "Utilizes the external gap emphasizing performing arts (theater-like narratives) to enrich cultural contextualization in evaluation, moving beyond Western-centric ethical paradigms.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a multilingual, multicultural benchmark dataset compiling performing arts narratives (plays, scripts, folklore) encoding distinct moral dilemmas and resolutions. Develop evaluation protocols aligning generated LLM responses with culturally grounded ethical interpretations, using human evaluators from varied cultural backgrounds.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Source and annotate global performing arts narratives with moral themes. 2) Design evaluation metrics reflecting cultural ethical norms (e.g., collectivism vs individualism). 3) Test LLM outputs on these scenarios comparing baseline and bias-mitigated versions. 4) Analyze cross-cultural variance in ethical alignment.",

        "title": "Cross-Cultural Ethical AI Benchmark Using Performing Arts Narratives to Advance AGI and Culture-Sensitive Commonsense Reasoning",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing ethical AI benchmarks predominantly reflect Western-centric paradigms and lack robust evaluation across diverse global moral frameworks, limiting their ability to assess and guide large language models (LLMs) toward culturally aware, ethically nuanced reasoning. This shortcoming constrains progress toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) with human-comparable commonsense ethical understanding and impedes meaningful human-AI ethical interaction across cultures.",
        "Motivation": "This research addresses the critical gap in evaluating LLM ethical reasoning by leveraging the rich, culturally grounded narratives encoded in global performing arts (such as theater, folklore, and scripted narratives) as a novel medium to capture diverse ethical perspectives. Uniquely, the benchmark is explicitly framed as a step toward AGI capable of culture-sensitive commonsense ethical reasoning, positioning it at the frontier of both ethical AI evaluation and broader intelligence research. By integrating concepts from human-computer interaction (HCI) theory, this work aims to design evaluation protocols that foster meaningful, interpretable ethical dialogues between humans and AI systems across cultural boundaries. This interdisciplinary fusion enhances the benchmark's novelty and impact amid a competitive research landscape.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose to construct a multilingual, multicultural benchmark dataset comprising carefully curated performing arts narratives encoding distinct moral dilemmas and culturally grounded resolutions. Central to the method is a rigorous human evaluation pipeline involving deeply knowledgeable cultural experts from diverse backgrounds, trained with standardized protocols to ensure consistent interpretation of cultural ethical norms. We will develop a comprehensive evaluator training program, including onboarding sessions, calibration tasks, and continuous validation through inter-rater reliability assessments. Pilot studies will quantitatively verify annotation consistency and cultural sensitivity before full-scale deployment. Furthermore, evaluation metrics will be designed to measure alignment of LLM outputs not only with cultural norms but also with commonsense ethical reasoning frameworks linked to AGI research. Drawing on HCI theory, the evaluation interface and feedback processes will be architected to support nuanced human-AI ethical interactions and iterative dialogue, informing model improvements. Automatic cultural norm classifiers will complement but not replace human evaluators, serving as auxiliary tools post rigorous human-centered validation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Source diverse performing arts narratives with embedded moral dilemmas from global cultures, ensuring linguistic and contextual variety.\n2) Recruit and rigorously train a panel of cultural experts through a structured program including calibration tasks and norm alignment exercises.\n3) Conduct pilot annotation studies to measure and optimize inter-rater reliability, refining training and guidelines accordingly.\n4) Develop culturally and ethically grounded evaluation metrics incorporating commonsense reasoning benchmarks aligned with AGI objectives.\n5) Implement the evaluation platform applying HCI principles to facilitate effective human-AI ethical dialogue and feedback collection.\n6) Evaluate baseline and bias-mitigated LLM versions on the benchmark, analyzing cross-cultural response variation and cultural alignment quantitatively.\n7) Use insights from evaluations to iteratively improve LLM ethical reasoning towards culture-sensitive commonsense capabilities, validating progress with repeated human expert assessments under controlled quality standards.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A scenario from Japanese Noh theater highlighting tension between social harmony and individual desire.\nExpected Output: The model generates a response that reflects culturally appropriate resolution prioritizing collective well-being while articulating underlying individual motivations, demonstrating context-aware, culturally aligned ethical reasoning that mirrors expert human interpretations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should expert human evaluation face scalability or consistency challenges, prioritized fallback measures include: augmenting evaluator panels with stringent competency-based selection and ongoing calibration; deploying automatic cultural norm classifiers only after thorough validation against expert benchmarks to minimize noise; and iterative refinement of evaluator training informed by performance analytics. Crowdsourcing will be avoided as a primary evaluation mechanism and used only in tightly controlled auxiliary roles with explicit quality control checkpoints based on HCI-driven interface enhancements to maintain evaluation integrity and cultural sensitivity."

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan outlines a promising process, but the proposed use of human evaluators from varied cultural backgrounds poses significant feasibility challenges. Achieving genuinely representative and consistent cultural annotations requires not only diverse but also deeply knowledgeable evaluators to capture nuanced ethical norms. Additionally, the fallback plan’s reliance on crowd-sourcing with detailed guidelines or automated classifiers risks introducing noisy or imprecise cultural assessments. To enhance feasibility, the plan should explicitly incorporate rigorous evaluator training protocols, validation mechanisms for annotation quality, and pilot studies to verify inter-rater reliability. Moreover, realistic timelines and resource assessments for sourcing, annotating, and evaluating diverse narratives are necessary to ensure the plan is practical and executable at scale without compromising quality or cultural sensitivity. This will help avoid methodological weaknesses and improve the scientific rigor of the evaluation approach in cross-cultural ethical AI benchmarking. Specifically revise the experiment plan section to integrate these practical details and validation strategies early on rather than as fallback options only, to strengthen scientific soundness and feasibility upfront in the proposal."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict as NOV-COMPETITIVE in a crowded area linking ethics, multilingualism, and cultural AI evaluation, the proposal can significantly enhance impact and novelty by explicitly connecting with concepts from artificial general intelligence and commonsense reasoning. For example, framing the benchmark as a stepping stone toward AGI that demonstrates culturally aware commonsense ethical reasoning could uniquely position it at the frontier of both ethical evaluation and general intelligence capabilities. Additionally, integrating insights from human-computer interaction theory could guide the design of evaluation protocols ensuring meaningful human-AI ethical dialogue across cultures. Suggest expanding the motivation and method sections to emphasize how capturing cultural ethical frameworks via performing arts narratives supports development of large language models capable of human-comparable, culture-sensitive reasoning. This integration could open interdisciplinary collaboration channels, broaden the benchmark’s applicability beyond NLP into AGI and HCI research communities, and elevate the proposal’s novelty and impact in a competitive landscape."
