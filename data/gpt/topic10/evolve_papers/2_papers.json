      "abstract": "Large language models represent a significant advancement in the field of AI. The underlying technology is key to further innovations and, despite critical views and even bans within communities and regions, large language models are here to stay. This commentary presents the potential benefits and challenges of educational applications of large language models, from student and teacher perspectives. We briefly discuss the current state of large language models and their applications. We then highlight how these models can be used to create educational content, improve student engagement and interaction, and personalize learning experiences. With regard to challenges, we argue that large language models in education require teachers and learners to develop sets of competencies and literacies necessary to both understand the technology as well as their limitations and unexpected brittleness of such systems. In addition, a clear strategy within educational systems and a clear pedagogical approach with a strong focus on critical thinking and strategies for fact checking are required to integrate and take full advantage of large language models in learning settings and teaching curricula. Other challenges such as the potential bias in the output, the need for continuous human oversight, and the potential for misuse are not unique to the application of AI in education. But we believe that, if handled sensibly, these challenges can offer insights and opportunities in education scenarios to acquaint students early on with potential societal biases, criticalities, and risks of AI applications. We conclude with recommendations for how to address these challenges and ensure that such models are used in a responsible and ethical manner in education.",

This article provides an opening for further discussion to the broader social and digital media research community and those interested in answering important questions related to these areas by leveraging a focused, productive approach. In supporting future educational endeavors within the communication classroom, and specifically to this topic, we propose five important considerations that will move the conversation forward. The considerations within this article are meant to engage scholars in intellectual conversation and to provide an initial foundation for the direction of communication education. They are not meant to be an exhaustive list, but rather initiate discussions within education and research addressing implications emerging technologies have had on our field and what could be incorporated into the media and communication curriculum to prepare educators and students alike.",

      "abstract": "This article explores the natural language generation capabilities of large language models with application to the production of two types of learning resources common in programming courses. Using OpenAI Codex as the large language model, we create programming exercises (including sample solutions and test cases) and code explanations, assessing these qualitatively and quantitatively. Our results suggest that the majority of the automatically generated content is both novel and sensible, and in some cases ready to use as is. When creating exercises we find that it is remarkably easy to influence both the programming concepts and the contextual themes they contain, simply by supplying keywords as input to the model. Our analysis suggests that there is significant value in massive generative machine learning models as a tool for instructors, although there remains a need for some oversight to ensure the quality of the generated content before it is delivered to students. We further discuss the implications of OpenAI Codex and similar tools for introductory programming education and highlight future research streams that have the potential to improve the quality of the educational experience for both teachers and students alike.",

      "abstract": "Artificial writing is permeating our lives due to recent advances in large-scale, transformer-based language models (LMs) such as BERT, GPT-2 and GPT-3. Using them as pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art for many natural language processing tasks and shown that they capture not only linguistic knowledge but also retain general knowledge implicitly present in the data. Unfortunately, LMs trained on unfiltered text corpora suffer from degenerated and biased behaviour. While this is well established, we show here that recent LMs also contain human-like biases of what is right and wrong to do, reflecting existing ethical and moral norms of society. We show that these norms can be captured geometrically by a ‘moral direction’ which can be computed, for example, by a PCA, in the embedding space. The computed ‘moral direction’ can rate the normativity (or non-normativity) of arbitrary phrases without explicitly training the LM for this task, reflecting social norms well. We demonstrate that computing the ’moral direction’ can provide a path for attenuating or even preventing toxic degeneration in LMs, showcasing this capability on the RealToxicityPrompts testbed.",

      "abstract": "We demonstrate that a neural network pretrained on text and fine-tuned on code solves mathematics course problems, explains solutions, and generates questions at a human level. We automatically synthesize programs using few-shot learning and OpenAI's Codex transformer and execute them to solve course problems at 81% automatic accuracy. We curate a dataset of questions from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s largest mathematics courses (Single Variable and Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, Introduction to Probability and Statistics, Linear Algebra, and Mathematics for Computer Science) and Columbia University's Computational Linear Algebra. We solve questions from a MATH dataset (on Prealgebra, Algebra, Counting and Probability, Intermediate Algebra, Number Theory, and Precalculus), the latest benchmark of advanced mathematics problems designed to assess mathematical reasoning. We randomly sample questions and generate solutions with multiple modalities, including numbers, equations, and plots. The latest GPT-3 language model pretrained on text automatically solves only 18.8% of these university questions using zero-shot learning and 30.8% using few-shot learning and the most recent chain of thought prompting. In contrast, program synthesis with few-shot learning using Codex fine-tuned on code generates programs that automatically solve 81% of these questions. Our approach improves the previous state-of-the-art automatic solution accuracy on the benchmark topics from 8.8 to 81.1%. We perform a survey to evaluate the quality and difficulty of generated questions. This work automatically solves university-level mathematics course questions at a human level and explains and generates university-level mathematics course questions at scale, a milestone for higher education.",

      "abstract": "Transformative artificially intelligent tools, such as ChatGPT, designed to generate sophisticated text indistinguishable from that produced by a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.",

It is freely accessible through a web portal created by the tool's developer, OpenAI. The program-which automatically creates text based on written prompts-is so popular that it's likely to be \"at capacity right now\" if you attempt to use it. When you do get through, ChatGPT provides endless entertainment. I asked it to rewrite the first scene of the classic American play <i>Death of a Salesman</i>, but to feature Princess Elsa from the animated movie <i>Frozen</i> as the main character instead of Willy Loman. The output was an amusing conversation in which Elsa-who has come home from a tough day of selling-is told by her son Happy, \"Come on, Mom. You're Elsa from <i>Frozen</i>. You have ice powers and you're a queen. You're unstoppable.\" Mash-ups like this are certainly fun, but there are serious implications for generative AI programs like ChatGPT in science and academia.",

It will argue that even assuming that the choices of AIs can be deemed free, they could not be considered creative due to the anthropological footprint of copyright law which traditionally covers only human creativity. This implies that copyright protection can be granted only to outputs that display a sufficient level of original human intervention, which is most likely present in AI-assisted works and, depending on the case, in AI-genassisted works, too. The desirability of stretching copyright further to accommodate artificial creativity is also lessened by the risk that it could saturate the creative market due to an overexpansion of monopoly rights. Thus, the copyright solution will be evaluated together with some existing alternative legal tools, such as neighbouring rights, sui generis rights, patents, or even the absence of protection over AI-generated works to preserve a robust public domain.",

      "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful and emerging technique for solving complex decision-making problems by learning from experience and interaction with an environment. In the field of finance, DRL has the potential to revolutionize the way we optimize portfolios, manage risk, and execute trades, by leveraging the vast amounts of data available and the ability of neural networks to learn and adapt. However, applying DRL to finance problems also poses several challenges, such as dealing with high-dimensional state spaces, long-term dependencies, and limited data. In this paper, we review the key concepts and algorithms of DRL, and we describe the opportunities and challenges of applying DRL to finance problems, such as portfolio optimization, risk management, and algorithmic trading. We also present several case studies and examples of how DRL has been applied to finance problems, and we discuss the evaluation and potential future directions of DRL in finance. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of DRL in finance and to highlight the potential and limitations of this promising field of research and application.",
