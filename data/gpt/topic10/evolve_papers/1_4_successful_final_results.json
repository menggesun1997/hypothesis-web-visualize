    "title": "Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Framework with LLM-Enhanced Environmental Priors for Landslide Forecasting",
    "Problem_Statement": "Insufficient integration of probabilistic time-series modeling with domain knowledge hampers robust dynamic forecasting of landslides under evolving climate conditions.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses external gap in applying Bayesian spatial-temporal frameworks fused with AI-driven climate and environmental priors. Combines high-potential innovations by using LLMs to extract latent environmental priors incorporated as Bayesian priors for enhanced uncertainty-aware land hazard prediction.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model of landslide occurrence with latent variables representing environmental states. Use LLMs to process scientific literature and climate models to generate priors on latent environmental dynamics which are injected into the Bayesian framework via informative hyperpriors. Employ variational inference for scalable posterior estimation. Adapt the framework dynamically as new observations arrive, enabling continuous updating.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble landslide event spatio-temporal datasets plus related climate change study corpora. 2) Fine-tune LLMs to produce environmental latent prior knowledge representations. 3) Develop Bayesian hierarchical model integrating LLM-derived priors. 4) Train and validate with comparison against non-Bayesian and non-LLM models. 5) Evaluate forecasting accuracy, calibration, and interpretability of uncertainty.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Historical landslide occurrence data and relevant environmental literature on permafrost thaw effects. Output: Probabilistic landslide risk maps with time-evolving uncertainty quantification informed by embedded domain knowledge.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If LLM priors introduce noise or bias, test alternative knowledge embedding methods (e.g., curated ontologies), or simplify hierarchical model assumptions. Use approximate inference techniques to improve computational efficiency."

        "title": "Integrated Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Framework with LLM-Enhanced Environmental Priors and Hydrological Ensemble Components for Actionable Landslide Risk Management",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing landslide forecasting methods often lack robust integration of probabilistic time-series modeling with dynamic environmental and hydrological knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in delivering actionable early warning and disaster risk mitigation under evolving climate conditions.",
        "Motivation": "While Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling and LLM-driven domain knowledge extraction both show promise individually, their combination remains underexplored in practical, multi-hazard disaster risk contexts. This work addresses a critical gap by embedding LLM-extracted environmental priors into a scalable Bayesian framework and further integrates hydrological modeling and mobile data analytics to enhance early warning capabilities. This multidisciplinary fusion significantly elevates forecasting accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and real-world applicabilityâ€”pushing beyond incremental novelty to provide a comprehensive decision-support system aligned with pressing societal needs in climate-sensitive and flood-prone inland mountainous regions.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal model of landslide occurrence conditioned on latent environmental states informed by climate and hydrological factors. Large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned on curated scientific corpora covering permafrost thaw, precipitation-evapotranspiration dynamics, and hydrologic system design, extract informative prior distributions over environmental latent variables. This probabilistic framework is augmented with outputs from integrated water resources and surface water hydrology models, forming an ensemble with neural-network-based mobile data analytics capturing real-time meteorological and geospatial inputs for enhanced early warning responsiveness. Approximate Bayesian inference leveraging tailored variational methods with preliminary computational benchmarks ensures scalability to large spatio-temporal datasets spanning diverse climatic and geological settings. The system dynamically updates as new observational and sensor data stream in, supporting continuous risk assessment and actionable alert generation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Collection: Assemble a multi-source dataset including historical landslide event records covering at least 10 years across diverse inland mountainous and flood-prone regions, complemented by high-resolution climate datasets, hydrological model outputs, and curated environmental literature (~5,000 documents). Ensure representation of varied geological and climatic conditions to robustly train and test models.\n2) LLM Fine-tuning: Fine-tune transformer-based LLMs using domain-specific literature and climate hazard reports. Evaluate semantic accuracy by establishing benchmarks with environmental science experts to validate relevance and coherence of generated priors. Include ablation studies to monitor bias and noise.\n3) Bayesian Model Development: Implement hierarchical spatio-temporal Bayesian model integrating LLM-derived priors and hydrological ensemble model outputs. Conduct scalability tests on datasets with millions of spatio-temporal points, referencing prior work on variational inference in high-dimensional spatio-temporal settings.\n4) Integration of Mobile Data Analytics: Incorporate neural network models processing mobile meteorological sensor data streams; analyze improvements in model responsiveness and early warning lead times.\n5) Validation and Benchmarking: Compare model forecasting accuracy, calibration (using proper scoring rules), interpretability, and early warning efficacy against state-of-the-art non-Bayesian models and traditional hydrological forecasts.\n6) Success Criteria and Risk Mitigation: Define quantitative thresholds for accuracy (>85% ROC-AUC on test sets), calibration (expected calibration error <5%), and computational efficiency (inference within 2 hours for daily updates). Employ fallback strategies such as ontology-based priors or simpler Bayesian structures if LLM integration shows degradation. Use adaptive data subsampling to manage computational loads.\n7) Reproducibility: Publish code, datasets, and detailed protocols to community repositories, ensuring transparency and facilitating independent verification.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A multi-year dataset combining historical landslide records from the mountainous inland regions of Western China with climate change projections including precipitation and evapotranspiration indices, relevant environmental literature about permafrost thaw, hydrological model outputs for surface water dynamics, and real-time mobile sensor data capturing rainfall intensity.\nOutput: High-resolution probabilistic landslide risk maps updated daily, with quantified time-evolving uncertainty and actionable alerts integrated within an early warning dashboard accessible to local disaster management authorities, demonstrating improved lead time and precision compared to baseline methods.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If LLM-derived priors introduce excessive noise or bias beyond tolerable limits, pivot to integrating curated environmental ontologies and expert-elicited priors to maintain domain knowledge embedding. Should computational complexity impede scalability, simplify hierarchical model layers, employ more aggressive variational approximations, or implement smarter data batching and spatial partitioning strategies. For mobile data streams with limited quality or availability, rely primarily on robust hydrological ensemble predictions enhanced by static LLM knowledge, while developing modular components to flexibly add real-time data as it becomes available."

The plan should explicitly address potential challenges in fine-tuning LLMs with specialized environmental literature, ensuring the semantic accuracy and relevance of generated priors. Furthermore, variational inference scalability claims require quantitative preliminary benchmarks or reference to prior work solving similarly sized spatiotemporal Bayesian problems. Including clear success criteria and contingency triggers within each experimental step would improve feasibility transparency and project management reliability, especially given the multi-disciplinary integration of AI, climate science, and geospatial modeling domains. Please refine the experiment design with these details and risk mitigation strategies for computational complexity and data heterogeneity issues, to realistically ensure successful model development and validation phases without over-ambition or under-resource estimation in this competitive area, thus increasing feasibility confidence and reproducibility potential in the community.\n\n"
