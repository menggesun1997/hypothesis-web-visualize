    "title": "Contextual Morality Injection via Dramatic Monologues in Transformer Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Transformer LLMs lack explicit mechanisms to incorporate deep ethical introspection reflective of individual moral struggles, limiting empathetic and bias-aware outputs.",
    "Motivation": "Draws from performing arts monologue traditions to inject individualized moral reasoning processes, addressing external gaps linking AI ethics with theater narratives to enrich LLM moral contextualization.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a transformer conditioning technique that injects dramatic monologue-style ethical reflections as latent context vectors during generation. Train on a curated corpus of monologues exploring inner moral conflicts to enable models to express nuanced ethical awareness and self-questioning in outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compile annotated dramatic monologues featuring moral dilemmas. 2) Fine-tune transformer decoders conditioned on monologue embeddings. 3) Generate outputs on ethical prompts with and without monologue conditioning. 4) Evaluate empathy, bias reduction, and moral depth via human and automated metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Should AI prioritize privacy over convenience?\" Output: A response incorporating self-reflective ethical reasoning mimicking a dramatic inner monologue that balances competing values.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If monologue conditioning dilutes factual accuracy, separate ethical reflection and factual answer generation modules to combine post-hoc. Alternatively, explore few-shot prompting with monologue exemplars."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks clarity on how the dramatic monologue-style ethical reflections are integrated as latent context vectors within transformer decoders. The process of encoding these monologues, their interaction with the base language model during generation, and ensuring they influence output ethical reasoning without overpowering factual accuracy is underspecified. You should elaborate on the technical details of conditioning—e.g., architectural modifications, training objectives, or regularization strategies—to clarify this mechanism and strengthen soundness assumptions for reproducibility and evaluation coherence as well as integration of ethical nuance without factual degradation in generated text outputs. Clearer delineation of how monologue embeddings modulate generation dynamically will also facilitate targeted experimentation and impact validation (e.g., empathy and bias metrics). This foundational mechanism clarity is crucial before experimental validation can be meaningful or credible to the community, given the novelty at the intersection of narrative ethics and transformer conditioning techniques.

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks crucial operational details that could jeopardize feasibility. There is no description of how the annotated moral dilemma monologues will be sourced, their scale, balancing, or annotation schema quality control—details that directly affect model training and generalization. The evaluation steps rely heavily on subjective human metrics (empathy, moral depth) but omit concrete automated proxies or baselines for bias reduction and ethical reasoning quality, risking ambiguous results. Also, the fallback strategies, while prudent, are vaguely defined and their criteria for activation are not specified, reducing experiment decisiveness. To improve, specify dataset construction protocols, annotation standards, baseline and ablation study designs, and concrete, replicable metrics for ethical output assessment. Additionally, integrate piloting with scale estimations to ensure resource feasibility and result robustness before full deployment to increase confidence in experimental success and clarity in outcome interpretation.
