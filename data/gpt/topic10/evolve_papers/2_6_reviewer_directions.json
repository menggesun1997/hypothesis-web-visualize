    "title": "Expertise-Calibrated Fact-Checking Layer for Trustworthy LLM Healthcare Outputs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Fact-checking of LLM outputs in healthcare lacks integration of user domain expertise, resulting in mismatches between model assertions and practitioner expectations or knowledge levels.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal limitations of quality control and external healthcare ethical AI integration gaps by incorporating expertise calibration into fact-checking modules.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a layered fact-checking component that calibrates verification strictness based on detected user expertise (novice to expert). Leverages a multi-tier database hierarchy (general medical knowledge to specialized clinical guidelines) dynamically selected to fact-check model outputs and provide context-anchored confidence scores and clarifications.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect healthcare Q&A datasets stratified by expertise level. 2) Implement expertise detection (via user input or interaction patterns). 3) Integrate multi-tiered fact-checker modules with LLM generation pipeline. 4) Measure accuracy and user trust gain across expertise groups.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What is the recommended dosage for pregnant women with hypertension?\" Output: Fact-checked response referencing guidelines appropriate for user expertise level, with confidence annotations and simplified explanations if novice.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If expertise detection proves unreliable, enable manual user profile settings for expertise. Alternatively, fallback to always using highest-tier guidelines with simplified explanations for novices."
