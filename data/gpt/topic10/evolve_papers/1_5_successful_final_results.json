        "title": "Human-Centered Interactive Explainability Dashboards Integrating Verified LLM Knowledge for Real-Time Landslide Risk Assessment",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current hazard management tools lack robust, adaptive, and user-centered interactive platforms that combine explainable AI outputs with rigorously validated domain knowledge to provide real-time, trustworthy, and interpretable landslide risk insights tailored to diverse stakeholder expertise. This gap hinders timely and effective decision-making in dynamic, high-stakes environments.",
        "Motivation": "While explainable AI, LLM integration, and interactive dashboards exist individually, their combined application in real-time landslide risk assessment often lacks rigorous usability evaluation, domain-specific validation, and explicit human-centered design. Our approach addresses this NOV-COMPETITIVE landscape by embedding advanced human-computer interaction (HCI) and human-centered AI principles to adapt explanation complexity by user expertise, ensuring interpretability, trust, and operational feasibility. Additionally, we propose a modular, future-proof pipeline architecture leveraging Advanced Information Systems Engineering to maintain adaptability and scalability. This multidisciplinary integration empowers stakeholders with actionable insights that dynamically contextualize environmental factors and model outputs, thus enhancing decision effectiveness in real-world hazard scenarios.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a modular, web-based, human-centered interactive dashboard that synergistically visualizes deep learning-based landslide susceptibility maps, SHAP explainability outputs, and rigorously fine-tuned LLM-generated textual explanations contextualized with verified geoscience knowledge. Key innovations include:\n\n- Integration of human-computer interaction theories to design adaptive explanation interfaces dynamically modulating complexity and modality based on user expertise levels, determined via profiling and interaction data.\n- Incorporation of a systematic LLM fine-tuning and validation framework involving domain expert-in-the-loop review and automated factual consistency checks to minimize hallucinations and errors.\n- Advanced Information Systems Engineering principles to architect a modular pipeline supporting easy update of underlying models, explanation methods, and UI components.\n- Resource optimization strategies such as incremental SHAP approximations, asynchronous LLM response generation, and intelligent caching to achieve sub-second latency under diverse technical infrastructures.\n- Continuous user feedback capture and analytics mechanisms implementing iterative dashboard refinement with milestone-driven feature prioritization aligned to real-time operation criteria.\n\nThis approach collectively elevates interpretability, trustworthiness, and usability beyond existing competitive methods, yielding a robust system that seamlessly aligns with usersâ€™ cognitive workflows and decision timelines in landslide risk management.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Integrate state-of-the-art deep learning landslide prediction models with efficient SHAP explainability, implementing approximation algorithms to reduce computation overhead.\n2) Fine-tune LLMs on diverse, expert-curated geoscience corpora using domain-adaptive pretraining; perform systematic validation with (a) automated factuality and consistency metrics, and (b) human expert review panels to confirm domain relevance and detect hallucinations.\n3) Design adaptive user interfaces grounded in HCI and human-centered AI frameworks that adjust explanation complexity and visualization modalities based on real-time user expertise profiling.\n4) Architect a modular pipeline adhering to advanced software engineering practices, enabling seamless swapping/upgrading of components.\n5) Conduct quantitative user studies in controlled and field environments with domain experts and non-expert stakeholders, using well-defined metrics including SUS (System Usability Scale), interpretability scores, trust indices, decision-making accuracy/improvements versus robust baselines.\n6) Employ rigorous statistical analysis (e.g., hypothesis testing, effect size calculations) to validate impact.\n7) Deploy continuous user feedback systems integrated with telemetry to iteratively improve the dashboard; define milestones for feature prioritization based on usage analytics and user satisfaction thresholds.\n8) Measure real-time operational performance focusing on sub-second interaction latency across hardware profiles, assessing resource usage and scalability.\n\nThis comprehensive plan ensures technical soundness, user empowerment, and operational practicality within typical research project constraints suitable for premier conference dissemination.",

        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time computation constraints preclude full SHAP or LLM on-the-fly processing, deploy hybrid strategies including precomputed explanation snippets for most queried regions and incremental SHAP value updates for dynamic data slices. Implement asynchronous LLM explanation generation with progressive disclosure of partial results to maintain interaction flow.\n\nSystematically collect structured user feedback through embedded surveys, interaction analytics, and semi-structured interviews tracked against milestones focusing on usability and trust gains.\n\nUse a feature prioritization framework that weighs impact versus computational cost to guide dashboard simplification or enhancement.\n\nResource management includes deploying lightweight model approximations or distilled LLM variants tailored for edge computing environments to sustain responsiveness.\n\nThese contingencies ensure a usable, trusted system with continuous user-driven refinement, preserving core contributions even under resource variability encountered in practical landslide risk management deployments."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan outlines sensible stages, but it lacks concrete metrics and evaluation criteria for assessing usability, interpretability, trust, and decision-making effectiveness. To enhance feasibility and scientific rigor, include detailed plans for quantitative user studies with clearly defined success metrics, baseline comparisons, and statistical validation. Additionally, clarify how the LLM fine-tuning on geoscience reports will be validated for domain relevance and accuracy to ensure the generated explanations do not propagate errors or hallucinations, which could undermine trust in real-time hazard assessment scenarios. Addressing these measurement and validation gaps will strengthen the experiment plan and the overall plausibility of the approach in operational settings within the project timeline and resources typically available at premier conferences venues like ACL or NeurIPS. The fallback plan on caching and simplification is reasonable but should also specify how user feedback will be systematically collected and incorporated to refine the dashboard iteratively, ideally with milestones and criteria for feature prioritization and performance targets in real-time operation contexts (e.g., sub-second interaction latency). This will better demonstrate feasibility of delivering a robust and usable system with explainability and LLM integration under real-world constraints and user needs stated in the Problem_Statement and Motivation sections.\n\nFurthermore, consider the computational cost and scalability challenges inherent in real-time SHAP value computation coupled with on-the-fly LLM explanation generation, and outline a clearer resource management or approximation strategy beyond the fallback plan to maintain responsiveness and practical deployment feasibility in diverse hazard monitoring settings. This clarity is crucial for the reviewers to assess methodological soundness and viability of the proposed approach at scale, which is central for impact and adoption potential in real-world landslide risk management scenarios where decisions are time-sensitive and technical infrastructure varies widely."

          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty screening rated this work as NOV-COMPETITIVE due to strong existing ties among explainable AI, LLM knowledge integration, and interactive dashboards, the authors should consider explicitly integrating 'human-centered artificial intelligence' and 'human-computer interaction' frameworks from the globally linked concepts to deepen user-centric design and evaluation. Specifically, incorporating user studies grounded in human-computer interaction theories and designing adaptive explanation interfaces that tailor complexity and modality of outputs to varying expertise levels could significantly enhance the system's interpretability, trust, and adoption. Moreover, linking with 'Advanced Information Systems Engineering' practices to architect a modular pipeline that can seamlessly evolve with new LLM advances or alternative explainability techniques would boost robustness and future-proofing. This would enrich impact by aligning AI system development with user cognitive models and real-world decision workflows central to hazard management, thus pushing the work beyond mere technical novelty towards meaningful real-world utility and scientific contribution. Leveraging interdisciplinary insights from these adjacent fields can raise the bar for technical rigor, user empowerment, and ultimately the societal impact of interactive explainability dashboards in geoscience and beyond."
