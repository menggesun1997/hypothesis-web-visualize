    "title": "EfficientDistill: Multi-Task Knowledge Distillation Framework for Compact NLP Dense Prediction Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Large, multi-task resource-aware Transformer models have high inference costs, yet current knowledge distillation approaches do not fully leverage multi-task signals across classification and dense prediction tasks for compact model learning.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external gap by integrating multi-task learning signals from image classification-inspired backbones and downstream dense prediction tasks into knowledge distillation frameworks to yield efficient, scalable NLP models.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop EfficientDistill, a unified multi-task knowledge distillation framework where a large teacher model trained on multiple correlated NLP tasks (classification, segmentation-like token labeling) transfers knowledge to a lightweight student model. The method incorporates task-specific hint layers and adaptive loss weighting to balance diverse objectives. The student adopts a hybrid Transformer-ConvNet backbone that exploits efficient local convolutions for feature reuse, reducing complexity.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Train a large teacher model on benchmark multi-task NLP datasets (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE, token labeling tasks).\n2. Define student architecture with hybrid efficient backbone.\n3. Perform distillation experiments, comparing to baseline student training without distillation.\n4. Evaluate on single and combined tasks, measuring model size, latency, and accuracy.\n5. Experiment with loss weighting strategies and hint layers to optimize multi-task learning.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence for sentiment classification and named entity recognition simultaneously.\nExpected Output: Compact student model predicts sentiment and entities accurately within latency bounds, outperforming baseline models of similar size.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-task distillation reduces performance on specific tasks, apply curriculum learning to progressively add tasks or revert to single-task distillation followed by fine-tuning on others."

        "title": "EfficientDistill+: Cross-Modal Semantic-Aligned Multi-Task Knowledge Distillation Framework for Hardware-Aware Compact NLP Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large multi-task Transformer-based NLP models, while powerful, incur high inference costs and struggle with efficient knowledge transfer across heterogeneous tasks including classification and token-level dense prediction. Existing distillation methods insufficiently capture multi-task synergy and do not effectively leverage semantic alignment or deployment-aware compression, limiting compact model performance and scalability.",
        "Motivation": "To address the stagnation in novelty of multi-task knowledge distillation for compact NLP models, we integrate advances from vision-language modeling and semantic alignment along with hardware-aware deployment considerations. By incorporating cross-modal-inspired distillation techniques and dynamic semantic alignment mechanisms between teacher and student, we aim to significantly improve knowledge transfer efficacy. Furthermore, adopting deployment-conscious compression strategies aligned with modern DNN hardware accelerators enhances practical relevance and scalability, distinctly advancing beyond current competitive baselines.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose EfficientDistill+, a unified multi-task distillation framework integrating three core innovations: (1) **Cross-Modal Semantic Alignment:** Inspired by vision-language models, we employ joint embedding spaces to align teacher and student representations semantically across tasks, with an adaptive alignment loss that dynamically balances inter- and intra-task feature affinities. (2) **Hybrid Transformer-ConvNet Student Backbone:** We justify and design the student architecture to utilize efficient local convolutional operations for feature reuse and reduced complexity, complemented by transformers for global context, supported by a detailed architectural diagram and pseudo-code. (3) **Adaptive Loss Weighting with Conflict-Aware Optimization:** We formulate mathematically an adaptive weighting schedule that monitors task gradient conflicts and dynamically modulates loss contributions during training to promote synergy and mitigate negative transfer. Deployment-oriented compression techniques such as structured pruning and quantization are jointly applied in the distillation loop, optimized for target DNN hardware accelerators. The method employs task-specific hint layers facilitating fine-grained knowledge transfer modulated by semantic alignment scores. This combination ensures explainable, reproducible mechanisms that markedly distinguish our approach from prior multi-task distillation methods.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Train a large multi-task teacher model on diverse NLP benchmarks including GLUE, SuperGLUE, and token-level labeling datasets.\n2. Define the hybrid Transformer-ConvNet student architecture with detailed layer specifications and visualize via architectural diagrams.\n3. Implement cross-modal semantic alignment modules with multi-level embedding projection and alignment losses.\n4. Develop adaptive loss weighting strategy incorporating gradient conflict metrics; include mathematical formulations.\n5. Integrate deployment-oriented compression (structured pruning, quantization) targeting hardware accelerator constraints.\n6. Conduct comprehensive distillation experiments comparing to baseline methods without semantic alignment, adaptive weighting, or hybrid backbone.\n7. Evaluate on individual and combined tasks assessing accuracy, latency, model size, and hardware inference efficiency.\n8. Perform ablation studies on the impact of semantic alignment, adaptive weighting, and compression techniques.\n9. Test on deployment scenarios with hardware accelerator simulators and report throughput and power consumption metrics.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence annotated simultaneously for sentiment classification, named entity recognition, and slot filling.\nExpected Output: A compact student model outputs high-accuracy predictions across all tasks within strict latency and power budgets optimized for deployment on edge AI hardware accelerators. Performance exceeds baseline models of similar size by 3-5% in F1 and reduces inference latency by 25%. Detailed analysis shows effective semantic alignment and balanced task optimization preventing negative transfer.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-task distillation with semantic alignment leads to degradation on specific tasks due to complexity, we will incrementally apply a curriculum learning strategy to progressively incorporate tasks. Additionally, fallback to sequential single-task distillation followed by semantic-aligned fine-tuning will be used. We also plan to simplify the hybrid backbone by varying convolutional module depth or transformer layers to find an optimal trade-off between complexity and performance. Deployment compression techniques will be adjusted to moderate pruning and quantization levels to avoid detrimental accuracy loss, validated via hardware-aware simulation feedback."

The proposal would benefit from a clearer architectural diagram or conceptual framework clarifying: 1) the flow and integration of multi-task signals during distillation; 2) the rationale behind the hybrid backbone choice and its direct impact on feature reuse and complexity reduction; and 3) how adaptive loss weighting dynamically balances task conflicts during training. Such clarity will strengthen confidence in the method's soundness and reproducibility, and better differentiate it from related multi-task distillation approaches in the literature.

Additionally, exploring deployment-oriented compression techniques in conjunction with hardware accelerators or DNN inference optimization could bolster practical relevance. Embedding such globally linked concepts would raise novelty, improve scalability across modalities, and appeal to a broader community seeking cross-domain and hardware-aware compact model solutions."
