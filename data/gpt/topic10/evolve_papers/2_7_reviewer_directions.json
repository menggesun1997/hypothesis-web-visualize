    "title": "Performative Ethics Training Dataset for AI Bias Mitigation",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a scarcity of training data that captures ethical dilemmas as performed or dramatized scenarios, limiting the capacity of LLMs to learn nuanced bias mitigation grounded in human interpretive contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Fulfills external gaps by creating resources at the intersection of AI ethics and performing arts, promoting models that internalize ethical reasoning in narrative-rich formats beyond static text.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Assemble a large-scale dataset comprising transcriptions and annotations from recorded theatrical performances focused on ethical conflicts, enriched with audience reactions and moral interpretation metadata. Train LLMs using multimodal learning integrating textual and paralinguistic cues to internalize ethical nuance and social context for bias reduction.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collaborate with theaters to collect performance data. 2) Annotate performances for ethical conflict points and audience sentiment. 3) Develop multimodal training pipelines incorporating audio-text embeddings. 4) Evaluate on bias-sensitive NLP tasks with ethical judgment annotation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Excerpt from a play where a character faces corruption temptation. Expected output: Model generates ethically reflective text considering moral tension and emotional subtext.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal integration is challenging, prioritize high-quality manual textual annotations and synthetic dramatized text generation to augment dataset. Alternatively, use simulated role-play transcripts as a proxy."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed experiment plan outlines valuable initial steps but lacks detail on how multimodal data (text, audio, performance annotations) will be effectively integrated and synchronized during model training. Collaboration with theaters and annotation of ethical conflict points are promising, yet the methodology for collecting and standardizing audience reaction and moral interpretation metadata remains unclear, which may jeopardize reproducibility and scalability. Further elaboration on annotation protocols, inter-annotator agreement measures, and concrete multimodal embedding techniques is necessary to ensure the experiment's feasibility and scientific rigor. Consider pilot studies or validation phases specifically targeting these annotations before scaling up data collection to mitigate risk and improve clarity of the pipeline design and evaluation criteria in bias-sensitive tasks targeted for downstream testing (e.g., ethical judgment datasets). This deeper methodological grounding will strengthen confidence in the experiment’s practical implementation and potential for reproducible impact outcomes in bias mitigation modeling. Target explicitly how you will validate ethical nuance capture and integrate paralinguistic cues effectively alongside text data to robustly train large language models within the proposed framework and resources constraints of collaboration with performing arts domains and multimodal AI research practices. This step is essential before broader implementation or claiming generalizability to bias reduction applications beyond theatrical contexts, to avoid costly bottlenecks or irreproducible results post data acquisition phase, and increase feasibility confidence from reviewers and funders alike.

          "feedback_content": "To elevate novelty and impact beyond a competitive intersection of AI ethics and performing arts, consider integrating concepts from human-centered design processes—specifically incorporating active involvement of users such as legal professionals or ethicists during annotation and model evaluation phases. For instance, co-design annotation schemas with scholars of interpretation of cultural heritage or legal evidence could enrich the dataset with multi-perspective ethical judgments. Additionally, leveraging transformation of museums and cultural heritage representation domains to curate staged ethical scenarios grounded in real-world social contexts could broaden dataset diversity and relevance. Such cross-disciplinary collaborations could provide unique ethical conflict narratives and moral interpretations, expanding the dataset beyond theatrical performances and enhancing societal impact. Embedding these globally linked concepts could strengthen external validity, diversify training inputs, and distinguish the research in a crowded field by demonstrating practical, interdisciplinary applicability aligned with human-centered AI system design values.
