    "Motivation": "Fills the gap of opaque AI-human collaboration by building adaptive transparency tools inspired by digital health interventions’ user trust mechanisms and organizational information disclosure strategies.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an interactive dashboard visualizing AI-generated suggestions, edits, confidence levels, and rationale in real-time during scientific writing, enabling users to audit and adjust AI participation adaptively.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Instrument existing LLM text editors with logging of AI activity. 2) Design UI/UX transparency visualizations. 3) Conduct user studies measuring trust and usability in scientific authoring contexts. 4) Iterate based on feedback for optimal transparency balance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Partial paragraph written by human, AI proposes continuation. Output: Dashboard shows AI confidence, suggestions provenance, and impact analysis for user to accept or reject.",

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section would benefit from a clearer and more detailed explanation of how AI confidence, rationale, and provenance data will be reliably extracted and integrated into the dashboard in real-time. It is unclear if current LLM APIs or infrastructures support providing such granular explanations and confidence metrics transparently and in a timely manner during user interaction. Clarify the underlying technical mechanisms or assumptions enabling this, and consider potential limitations of existing language models' explainability capabilities relevant to scientific writing contexts, to strengthen the method's soundness and credibility. Providing preliminary technical feasibility justifications here will greatly improve confidence in the approach's validity and practical application potential, which is critical given the complexity of adaptive transparency in AI-assisted writing workflows. Targeting meaningful AI interpretability in real-time is non-trivial and requires explicit architectural or algorithmic considerations, which are currently underspecified in the proposal's description of the method itself.  Please elaborate on these aspects to solidify the proposal's core mechanism and assumptions about transparency features it aims to implement and evaluate, addressing potential gaps between AI's actual explainability properties and the envisioned user-facing visualizations and controls in the dashboard design.  This step is necessary to convincingly demonstrate that the core approach is indeed technically achievable and can deliver the promised user benefits in a scientific writing setting where trust and interpretability are paramount.  Hence, enhance the Proposed_Method section with a more precise technical roadmap on how AI rationale, confidence, and provenance will be sourced, modeled, and presented interactively, taking into account constraints and capabilities of current large language models and APIs for real-time access to such metadata within generated content suggestions and edits for scientific documents.  This is essential for validating core assumptions and ensuring the approach's practical feasibility as framed currently in the research idea summary.  It also informs the design and iteration plans described later, linking all stages cohesively for a robust, sound methodology, improving the overall quality and impact of the research proposal significantly.  This critique focuses on improving soundness by clarifying and justifying critical underlying assumptions and mechanisms currently only broadly outlined but vital to the study's success and novelty claims in transparent AI-assisted scientific writing interfaces.  Please address this promptly to reinforce the foundation upon which feasibility and impact depend in this challenging but important research area with strong community interest and competitive innovation landscape previously noted in the novelty screening results.  In summary, more detailed, concrete, and technically grounded descriptions of the adaptive transparency mechanisms and their realizability must be added in the Proposed_Method section to ensure soundness and clarity for peer reviewers and potential downstream implementation in a real system context.  Without doing so, the proposal risks being perceived as overly high-level or aspirational without sufficient evidence it can meet its goals effectively in practice, limiting confidence in its ultimate value and success potential at a premier venue.  This is especially important because transparency in AI-human collaborative writing is an emerging, technically demanding problem space heavily scrutinized on these aspects by top conferences and reviewers.  Strengthening this dimension directly addresses reviewer concerns about feasibility and novelty synergy, securing critical buy-in for further work and community adoption and influence.  Thorough elaboration here will establish a strong foundation that subsequent experiment design, user studies, and impact claims can build on convincingly, making this the highest priority revision item identified in the internal review.  Thank you!  (Target section: Proposed_Method)  (Feedback code: SOU-MECHANISM)  (Recommendation: add technical details on extracting and presenting AI rationale, confidence, and provenance in real-time for scientific writing collaborative interfaces. Clarify assumptions and model constraints.)  (Impact: increase methodology soundness and credibility, align assumptions with current capabilities.)  (Urgency: critical for strengthening proposal foundation and community acceptance.)"

          "feedback_content": "To enhance both the impact and novelty beyond the current state of the art—given the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating—integrate relevant concepts from the linked global topics such as 'Explainable Artificial Intelligence' (XAI) and 'Technological Transparency' with organizational and regulatory frameworks like the 'Artificial Intelligence Act' and considerations around 'high-risk AI systems' especially in scientific knowledge production domains. Embedding compliance and audit capabilities aligned with evolving AI governance standards will elevate the transparency dashboard from a purely user-interface tool to a system that supports accountability, ethical use, and possibly regulatory oversight. Incorporating security aspects like 'attribute-based access control' could help tailor transparency levels according to user roles or document sensitivity, balancing openness with confidentiality requirements inherent in scientific collaborations. Moreover, applying structural equation modeling techniques from the list could systematically analyze and model determinants of users’ trust and acceptance (e.g., performance expectancy, effort expectancy) measured during user studies. This integration grounds empirical evaluation in rigorous theoretical frameworks from technology acceptance literature while anchoring the system’s design in responsible AI principles with potential broader impacts on AI governance and human-AI partnership ecosystems. This combined approach will help the proposal achieve a more global, cross-disciplinary resonance—appealing to research communities interested not only in AI-human interaction and explainability, but also AI ethics, policy, and secure collaborative knowledge workflows. This strategic expansion aligns well with state-of-the-art challenges and societal demands, positioning the work at the frontier of trustworthy and compliant AI tool development for science, thus addressing novelty and impact deficits simultaneously.  (Target section: Proposed_Method and Impact)  (Feedback code: SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION)  (Tip: leverage linked concepts to incorporate compliance, security, and formal user trust modeling to substantially broaden the proposal’s significance and innovation level.)"
