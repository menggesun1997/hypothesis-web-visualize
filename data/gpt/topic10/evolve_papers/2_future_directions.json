        "title": "Theatrical Morality Scaffolds for Bias Mitigation in LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM bias mitigation approaches rarely incorporate culturally rich, context-sensitive moral frameworks, limiting their effectiveness in representing nuanced ethical reasoning across diverse human contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap of lacking cross-disciplinary frameworks combining ethical AI with performing arts and humanities. By integrating theatrical narrative and moral cognition concepts (e.g., 'Willy Loman'), it proposes a novel, culturally aware bias mitigation approach.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a framework that encodes moral trajectories and character conflict resolutions from theater scripts into embedding spaces as ethical 'scaffolds'. These scaffolds guide LLM generation toward contextually appropriate moral reasoning, leveraging a 'dramaturgical morality module' that dynamically adjusts model outputs based on stage-like role conflicts and audience perspectives learned from curated dramatic literature corpora.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect annotated theater scripts with moral conflict labeling. 2) Pretrain an embedding alignment module to map moral conflicts to transformer latent states. 3) Integrate the dramaturgical morality module into an LLM such as GPT-4. 4) Evaluate bias reduction and moral contextualization using existing bias benchmarks expanded with new theater-inspired moral dilemma datasets. Metrics include fairness scores, human judgment on ethical appropriateness, and cultural sensitivity.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"A financial advisor suggests risky investment ignoring client welfare.\" Expected output: An explanation of the ethical conflict framed as a 'Willy Loman'-style tragic flaw narrative, prompting caution and balanced risk appraisal.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If moral scaffolds do not improve bias mitigation, fallback to probing model latent space with synthetic moral dilemma prompts to identify embed-space bias. Alternatively, incorporate other humanities sources such as classical philosophy texts for moral contextualization."

        "title": "Domain Expertise-Guided Adaptive Bias Correction in Clinical NLP",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM bias mitigation in healthcare NLP lacks dynamic adaptation to varying domain expertise of users and context-specific clinical practices, reducing trustworthiness and efficacy in sensitive medical decisions.",
        "Motivation": "Directly addresses internal gaps in bias mitigation tied to domain expertise variability and external needs in healthcare ethical AI. Novel approach is adaptive and user-context sensitive, beyond static bias correction.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Build an adaptive bias correction system that leverages continuous feedback from domain experts embedded as a contextual module within LLM-driven clinical NLP pipelines. This includes a meta-learning component that updates bias correction weights based on expertise signals (e.g., clinician credentials, location, specialty) and patient demographics, enabling personalized ethical alignment and factual accuracy.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect clinical note datasets annotated for common biases and errors. 2) Develop expertise embedding vectors from clinician metadata. 3) Integrate adaptive bias correction modules in a clinical LLM (e.g., ClinicalBERT + GPT). 4) Perform evaluations via clinician-in-the-loop tasks measuring bias reduction, accuracy, and trust metrics on context-specific clinical decision tasks.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Patient with asthma and heart disease needs medication plan.\" Output: Bias-corrected treatment recommendations that vary appropriately according to specialty input (cardiology vs pulmonology) and patient demographics, reducing stereotypical errors.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive correction proves unstable, fallback to rule-based bias filtering using detection heuristics followed by manual domain expert overrides. Alternatively, explore static bias correction fine-tuning constrained by domain expert consensus."

        "title": "Generative AI with Critical Thinking Scaffolds for Student Bias Literacy",
        "Problem_Statement": "Students engaging with AI-generated content often lack critical appraisal tools to recognize and understand embedded biases, limiting the educational potential of LLMs in promoting digital literacy and ethical awareness.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses gaps related to human oversight, critical appraisal, and AI bias literacy in education by combining generative AI with explicit critical thinking scaffolding, advancing beyond current few-shot prompt engineering.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a generative AI tutoring system embedding layered critical-thinking prompts and meta-cognitive reflection questions triggered dynamically during content generation. Incorporate scaffolding inspired by self-regulated learning theories and critical appraisal skills to foster awareness of biases in generated outputs, encouraging iterative student-LLM dialogue and self-correction.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop curriculum-aligned prompts with critical-thinking scaffolds. 2) Integrate these into a fine-tuned LLM (e.g., GPT-4) interface for education. 3) Conduct classroom trials measuring student engagement, bias recognition improvement, and learning outcomes using validated digital literacy scales.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Explain the impact of historical figures.\" AI generates content with embedded prompts like \"What perspectives might be missing here?\" and \"Can you identify potential stereotypes?\" Students respond and improve output iteratively.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If scaffolding reduces engagement, adjust prompt complexity or introduce gamified bias-detection challenges. Alternatively, implement teacher-moderated AI sessions for guided critical appraisal."

        "Problem_Statement": "Current ethical AI benchmarks lack culturally diverse evaluative scenarios, resulting in limited assessment of LLM bias mitigationâ€™s effectiveness across global moral frameworks.",
        "Motivation": "Utilizes the external gap emphasizing performing arts (theater-like narratives) to enrich cultural contextualization in evaluation, moving beyond Western-centric ethical paradigms.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create a multilingual, multicultural benchmark dataset compiling performing arts narratives (plays, scripts, folklore) encoding distinct moral dilemmas and resolutions. Develop evaluation protocols aligning generated LLM responses with culturally grounded ethical interpretations, using human evaluators from varied cultural backgrounds.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Source and annotate global performing arts narratives with moral themes. 2) Design evaluation metrics reflecting cultural ethical norms (e.g., collectivism vs individualism). 3) Test LLM outputs on these scenarios comparing baseline and bias-mitigated versions. 4) Analyze cross-cultural variance in ethical alignment.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A scenario from Japanese Noh theater emphasizing social harmony vs individual desire. Expected output: Model response aligning with culturally accepted resolution, reflecting context-aware ethical reasoning.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If human evaluation proves inconsistent, employ crowd-sourcing with detailed guidelines or develop automatic cultural norm classifiers to approximate cultural alignment assessments."

        "title": "Latent Moral Direction Embeddings with Population-Level Variance Modeling",
        "Problem_Statement": "Methods like 'moral direction' embeddings do not adequately capture variance in moral values across distinct populations, hindering generalization of bias correction across contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Focuses on the internal gap of real-world generalization of moral directions by modeling population-level variation, enabling more robust, pluralistic ethical AI behavior.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Extend moral direction embeddings by training probabilistic latent variable models that represent distributions of moral perspectives derived from diverse population data (e.g., surveys, social media). Integrate these distributions into LLM generation as conditional biases with controllable parameters reflecting target community norms.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect diverse moral value datasets (e.g., World Values Survey). 2) Train latent variable models to represent moral direction distributions. 3) Incorporate these into LLM decoding as soft bias constraints. 4) Evaluate adaptation and ethical consistency across sub-population benchmarks.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Should lying be permissible in business?\" Output varies based on sampled moral direction conditioning reflecting cultural subgroup, providing nuanced responses.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If probabilistic conditioning is unstable, fallback to discrete moral archetypes with switchable ethical modes or ensemble methods reflecting diverse viewpoints."

        "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM bias audits lack granular interpretation of how roles and character archetypes influence embedded biases in text generation, limiting actionable insights for mitigation.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the external gap linking theater role understanding ('Princess','Willy Loman') with bias interpretability by using narrative archetypal role detection as a tool for bias auditing.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an automatic narrative role detection system identifying archetypical roles in generated outputs (hero, victim, villain). Cross-reference these with known bias patterns (e.g., stereotyping of certain demographics) to pinpoint role-based bias manifestations. Use this audit to guide targeted bias reduction interventions in model fine-tuning.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Compile annotated datasets with labeled narrative roles and demographic attributes. 2) Train classifiers for role recognition in generated text. 3) Evaluate correlation between role assignment and bias metrics. 4) Perform bias correction using role-sensitive fine-tuning and re-evaluate.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Generated story with a female character cast as 'damsel in distress.' Detection highlights stereotypical role bias prompting corrective response generation minimizing stereotype reinforcement.",

        "Motivation": "Addresses internal limitations of quality control and external healthcare ethical AI integration gaps by incorporating expertise calibration into fact-checking modules.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a layered fact-checking component that calibrates verification strictness based on detected user expertise (novice to expert). Leverages a multi-tier database hierarchy (general medical knowledge to specialized clinical guidelines) dynamically selected to fact-check model outputs and provide context-anchored confidence scores and clarifications.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect healthcare Q&A datasets stratified by expertise level. 2) Implement expertise detection (via user input or interaction patterns). 3) Integrate multi-tiered fact-checker modules with LLM generation pipeline. 4) Measure accuracy and user trust gain across expertise groups.",
