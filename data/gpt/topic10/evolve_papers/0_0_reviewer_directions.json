    "title": "Context-Aware Adaptive Evaluation Framework for LLM Scientific Outputs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluation methods for LLM-generated scientific texts lack adaptive rigor and domain-specific validation, leading to unreliable outputs and mistrust among researchers.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient robust evaluation and testing frameworks by leveraging methodologies from healthcare implementation science, introducing adaptive, context-sensitive testing to improve output quality and trustworthiness.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a modular context-aware evaluation system integrating domain ontologies and contextual barrier mechanisms inspired by biomedical software testing. The framework dynamically adapts evaluation criteria based on domain-specific contexts, incorporating interpretability modules that elucidate evaluation rationale to users, enabling iterative refinement of LLM outputs within scientific pipelines.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets from multiple scientific domains (biomedical articles, finance reports). 2) Implement baseline quality metrics (BLEU, factuality scores). 3) Build context models capturing domain-specific constraints and evaluation rules. 4) Measure system efficacy via user studies assessing trust and relevance. 5) Compare to static evaluation baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM-generated summary of a new oncology research paper. Expected output: Evaluation report highlighting adherence to biomedical standards, identifying potential factual inconsistencies, with interpretability cues explaining assessment reasoning.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive context models overcomplicate evaluation, fallback to hybrid static-dynamic frameworks emphasizing domain rule embedding, with manual expert feedback loops to guide improvements."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that methodologies from healthcare implementation science, such as context-sensitive adaptive testing and domain-specific barrier models, will translate effectively into evaluating LLM-generated scientific texts across diverse domains. However, the assumption that such biomedical-inspired frameworks can capture the nuances and variability in scientific language and factuality broadly is not thoroughly justified. Clarifying the conceptual mapping between biomedical testing mechanisms and LLM output evaluation—potentially with preliminary validation—would strengthen this foundational assumption and avoid overgeneralization risks inherent in cross-domain methodology transfers. Without this, the soundness of adapting healthcare evaluation frameworks remains speculative and needs empirical or theoretical substantiation before full-scale development is initiated, to ensure the system’s core validity is well-grounded and not just intuitively appealing or overreaching in scope, which could undermine trust and utility in scientific pipelines at large (especially outside biomedical fields). Please elaborate on how domain-specific contextual barriers will be identified reliably for less-structured or emerging domains and why the biomedical analogy is expected to generalize effectively beyond its original scope (and any limitations thereof). This is essential for soundness assurance in your assumption base and the eventual design choices in Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan sections, ensuring the foundation is robust rather than optimistic abstraction from a single domain’s practice to a broad evaluation framework scope.  \n\nTargeted enhancement: Include a clear conceptual/theoretical mapping and possibly a small empirical pilot or literature review that supports this cross-domain methodology adaptation’s feasibility and validity prior to full implementation planning. This will also help in defining the boundaries of applicability clearly and managing expectations effectively in downstream user studies and impact claims.  \n\nBy addressing this, you will mitigate risks related to foundational concept transfer and better position the work as methodologically sound and credible when reviewed by domain experts from multiple scientific fields, who may otherwise question the applicability and generalizability of these borrowed biomedical testing principles for LLM scientific text evaluation, affecting overall trust in system outputs even beyond the technical NLP community.  \n\nRecommend also discussing fallback justifications from this viewpoint to present a cogent fallback approach rationale linked to these core assumption challenges, enhancing soundness rigor and research transparency overall in your proposal's foundation sections (Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method).  \n\n(This critique targets the fundamental assumption validity that underpins the whole project’s premise, whose solidity is crucial.)  \n\nSection: Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method."

          "feedback_content": "The outlined Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan currently lacks detail on how domain-specific context models will be constructed and validated, particularly regarding their adaptability and scalability across heterogeneous scientific fields. The plan mentions collecting datasets from multiple domains and building context models but does not specify strategies for acquiring domain ontologies or expert knowledge to accurately encode domain constraints, nor how these models will dynamically adapt rather than static rule embeddings. Moreover, the user study design to measure trust and relevance needs elaboration: how will participants be selected, what metrics or instruments will be used to quantify trust, and how will subjective user feedback be integrated with objective evaluation metrics? Also, the time and resource demands of iterative refinement loops and interpretability module validation are implied but not concretely scoped or scheduled. Given the complexity of biomedical-level evaluation combined with other domains like finance, feasibility regarding dataset access, expert involvement, and computational cost should be assessed upfront and explicitly incorporated. Without a more granular, methodical experimental protocol and contingency plans for different domain challenges, the feasibility of executing the entire plan successfully remains questionable.  \n\nTo improve, provide detailed intermediate milestones and concrete success criteria for each phase, explicit outlines of required domain expertise sourcing (e.g., partnerships with biomedical or finance experts), strategies for automated vs manual evaluation balancing, and concrete methods for interpreting and demonstrating user trust improvements. Consider potential technical risks, e.g., difficulties in integrating heterogeneous domain ontologies, and plan corresponding mitigation strategies. Explicitly clarify how the fallback plan will be triggered and incorporated within the experiment timeline.  \n\nAddressing these gaps will significantly improve confidence in the project’s practical executability and scientific rigor, ensuring robust validation aligned with the ambitious proposed adaptive evaluation framework.  \n\nSection: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan."
