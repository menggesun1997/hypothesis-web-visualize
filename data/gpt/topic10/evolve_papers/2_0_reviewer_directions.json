    "title": "Theatrical Morality Scaffolds for Bias Mitigation in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM bias mitigation approaches rarely incorporate culturally rich, context-sensitive moral frameworks, limiting their effectiveness in representing nuanced ethical reasoning across diverse human contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap of lacking cross-disciplinary frameworks combining ethical AI with performing arts and humanities. By integrating theatrical narrative and moral cognition concepts (e.g., 'Willy Loman'), it proposes a novel, culturally aware bias mitigation approach.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a framework that encodes moral trajectories and character conflict resolutions from theater scripts into embedding spaces as ethical 'scaffolds'. These scaffolds guide LLM generation toward contextually appropriate moral reasoning, leveraging a 'dramaturgical morality module' that dynamically adjusts model outputs based on stage-like role conflicts and audience perspectives learned from curated dramatic literature corpora.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect annotated theater scripts with moral conflict labeling. 2) Pretrain an embedding alignment module to map moral conflicts to transformer latent states. 3) Integrate the dramaturgical morality module into an LLM such as GPT-4. 4) Evaluate bias reduction and moral contextualization using existing bias benchmarks expanded with new theater-inspired moral dilemma datasets. Metrics include fairness scores, human judgment on ethical appropriateness, and cultural sensitivity.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"A financial advisor suggests risky investment ignoring client welfare.\" Expected output: An explanation of the ethical conflict framed as a 'Willy Loman'-style tragic flaw narrative, prompting caution and balanced risk appraisal.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If moral scaffolds do not improve bias mitigation, fallback to probing model latent space with synthetic moral dilemma prompts to identify embed-space bias. Alternatively, incorporate other humanities sources such as classical philosophy texts for moral contextualization."

          "feedback_content": "The \"Proposed_Method\" section introduces a dramaturgical morality module that adapts LLM outputs using theatrical narratives and moral scaffolds based on character conflict resolution. However, the mechanism describing how these moral trajectories are encoded and integrated into the LLM’s latent space remains vague and under-specified. Clarify the technical details of the embedding alignment: how the annotated moral conflicts in theater scripts will be quantitatively represented, how these morality embeddings interface with the transformer architecture, and how dynamic role conflicts and audience perspectives are modelled in real-time generation. A clearer computational design with precise algorithmic steps will strengthen soundness and reproducibility of the approach, improving confidence in the method’s novelty and effectiveness in bias mitigation. Provide examples of expected latent space interventions, and how they promote ethical reasoning without compromising linguistic fluency or model coherence. Without these clarifications, the core invention risks appearing conceptual rather than methodologically grounded or implementable at scale, which could reduce confidence in practical impact and scientific contribution here. This foundational clarity is critical prior to experimental validation efforts described later in your plan, to ensure experiments target the module’s actual functioning and limitations accurately and rigorously required for a competitive venue acceptance and for meaningful bias mitigation progress in challenging, culturally nuanced contexts. This feedback should take precedence because method soundness influences feasibility and impact downstream critically and early in the review process stages.  \n\n(This targets the \"Proposed_Method\" section.)  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The \"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\" outlines a four-step process from data collection to evaluation. While ambitious, the practical feasibility of this plan raises concerns. Annotated theater scripts with moral conflict labels may be scarce or inconsistent; precise guidelines for annotation schema development, inter-annotator reliability checks, and dataset scale are missing. The pretraining of an embedding alignment module bridging moral conflicts to transformer latent states requires more detail on architectural choices, training datasets, and evaluation protocols to assess embedding quality and alignment before full integration. Integrating a novel dramaturgical morality module into a proprietary, large-scale LLM such as GPT-4 poses engineering and access challenges; clarify if fine-tuning or prompt-engineering strategies are feasible given access constraints. The evaluation strategy depends on newly constructed theater-inspired moral dilemma datasets and existing bias benchmarks expanded accordingly, but lacks specification on metrics thresholds, baseline comparisons, or human evaluation protocols, which are crucial to validate ethical appropriateness and cultural sensitivity claims. To ensure scientific validity and reproducibility, the plan needs refinement with clear experimental controls, data acquisition strategies, resource estimates, and fallback experimental designs considering access limitations to large LLMs. Addressing these feasibility details early will be vital to successful and credible empirical demonstration of the approach under typical constraints of research venue standards and reviewer expectations.  \n\n(This targets the \"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\" section.)"

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty assessment rated this idea as NOV-COMPETITIVE and considering the nationwide strength of existing bias mitigation work, to enhance impact and distinguish this research, actively integrating globally-linked concepts such as 'cultural communication,' 'audience reception,' and 'matters of cultural difference' is recommended. For instance, explicitly incorporating mechanisms to tailor moral scaffolds to different cultural contexts or audience demographics through adaptive dramaturgical roles could broaden applicability and fairness. Leveraging insights from 'creative professionals' and 'performance art' practitioners to refine moral narratives can offer richer, interdisciplinary grounding, improving contextual sensitivity beyond textual analysis. Further, embedding this research within the 'global academic community' and 'global creative industries' via collaborative datasets or cross-cultural evaluation protocols would boost relevance and adoption. Aligning with principles of 'coexistence of cultures' and 'public relations' could help transform technical outputs into socially acceptable and culturally coherent ethical reasoning modules, extending impact from purely technical contributions to real-world societal benefits. This multi-dimensional integration would enhance novelty, elevate impact beyond standard LLM bias mitigation, and position the research as a pioneering crosscutting effort combining AI ethics, humanities, and global cultural insight.  \n\n(This suggestion targets the general approach leveraging \"Globally-Linked Concepts\".)"
