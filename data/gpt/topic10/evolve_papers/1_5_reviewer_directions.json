    "title": "Interactive Explainability Dashboards Integrating LLM Knowledge for Real-Time Landslide Risk Assessment",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of interactive tools combining explainable AI outputs with domain knowledge limits practical utility for hazard stakeholders needing real-time interpretable landslide risk insights.",
    "Motivation": "Fills novel external gap of interactive explainability to jointly evaluate model reliability and environmental factors dynamically. Merges advances in explainable AI, LLM-based knowledge integration, and user interface design to empower decision-makers with actionable insights.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a web-based interactive dashboard that visualizes deep learning model outputs (e.g., susceptibility maps) alongside SHAP-based explanations and textual knowledge synthesized by LLMs describing environmental context and rationale. Allow users to query and manipulate data slices spatio-temporally, and receive adaptive interpretation highlighting key driving factors for changing hazard conditions in real-time.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Integrate existing deep learning landslide prediction models with SHAP explainability modules. 2) Fine-tune LLMs on geoscience reports for contextual textual generation. 3) Design user interfaces for spatio-temporal navigation and explanation visualization. 4) Test dashboard usability with domain experts and non-experts. 5) Measure impact on interpretability, trust, and decision-making effectiveness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User queries risks for a specific watershed region after recent storm events. Output: Dynamic susceptibility map, SHAP feature importance plot, and LLM-generated textual explanation linking recent rainfall to landslide susceptibility increases.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time performance is inadequate, incorporate model approximation caching and precomputed explanation snippets. Solicit user feedback to prioritize features and simplify visualizations as needed."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experiment plan outlines sensible stages, but it lacks concrete metrics and evaluation criteria for assessing usability, interpretability, trust, and decision-making effectiveness. To enhance feasibility and scientific rigor, include detailed plans for quantitative user studies with clearly defined success metrics, baseline comparisons, and statistical validation. Additionally, clarify how the LLM fine-tuning on geoscience reports will be validated for domain relevance and accuracy to ensure the generated explanations do not propagate errors or hallucinations, which could undermine trust in real-time hazard assessment scenarios. Addressing these measurement and validation gaps will strengthen the experiment plan and the overall plausibility of the approach in operational settings within the project timeline and resources typically available at premier conferences venues like ACL or NeurIPS. The fallback plan on caching and simplification is reasonable but should also specify how user feedback will be systematically collected and incorporated to refine the dashboard iteratively, ideally with milestones and criteria for feature prioritization and performance targets in real-time operation contexts (e.g., sub-second interaction latency). This will better demonstrate feasibility of delivering a robust and usable system with explainability and LLM integration under real-world constraints and user needs stated in the Problem_Statement and Motivation sections.\n\nFurthermore, consider the computational cost and scalability challenges inherent in real-time SHAP value computation coupled with on-the-fly LLM explanation generation, and outline a clearer resource management or approximation strategy beyond the fallback plan to maintain responsiveness and practical deployment feasibility in diverse hazard monitoring settings. This clarity is crucial for the reviewers to assess methodological soundness and viability of the proposed approach at scale, which is central for impact and adoption potential in real-world landslide risk management scenarios where decisions are time-sensitive and technical infrastructure varies widely."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty screening rated this work as NOV-COMPETITIVE due to strong existing ties among explainable AI, LLM knowledge integration, and interactive dashboards, the authors should consider explicitly integrating 'human-centered artificial intelligence' and 'human-computer interaction' frameworks from the globally linked concepts to deepen user-centric design and evaluation. Specifically, incorporating user studies grounded in human-computer interaction theories and designing adaptive explanation interfaces that tailor complexity and modality of outputs to varying expertise levels could significantly enhance the system's interpretability, trust, and adoption. Moreover, linking with 'Advanced Information Systems Engineering' practices to architect a modular pipeline that can seamlessly evolve with new LLM advances or alternative explainability techniques would boost robustness and future-proofing. This would enrich impact by aligning AI system development with user cognitive models and real-world decision workflows central to hazard management, thus pushing the work beyond mere technical novelty towards meaningful real-world utility and scientific contribution. Leveraging interdisciplinary insights from these adjacent fields can raise the bar for technical rigor, user empowerment, and ultimately the societal impact of interactive explainability dashboards in geoscience and beyond."
