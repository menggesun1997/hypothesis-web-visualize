    "title": "User-Driven Interactive Bias Correction Interface for Financial LLM Applications",
    "Problem_Statement": "Bias mitigation in LLM applications for finance does not adequately incorporate interactive, user-driven corrections that adjust outputs dynamically based on user expertise and preferences.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to internal gaps in quality control influenced by domain expertise in finance while introducing a novel human-in-the-loop mechanism for trust-building and dynamic mitigation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an interactive interface allowing finance professionals to flag and correct biased or inaccurate LLM-generated content in real-time. The system learns from these corrections via reinforcement learning to personalize bias filters and adapt outputs to the user's expertise and domain context over time.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Integrate feedback collection modules within finance-focused LLM interfaces. 2) Collect and label bias flags and corrections from domain experts. 3) Train reinforcement learning agents to adjust generation parameters. 4) Evaluate improvements in output fairness, accuracy, and user satisfaction over iterative sessions.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Generated investment advice showing gender bias in risk profiling. User flags and corrects bias. Subsequent outputs adjust risk assessments eliminating biases respecting user's professional knowledge.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If online learning is unstable, revert to batch retraining on aggregated corrections. Alternatively, implement semi-supervised learning on corrected outputs for bias reduction."

          "feedback_content": "The mechanism by which reinforcement learning will personalize bias filters and dynamically adapt outputs requires clearer elaboration. Details such as the state and action spaces, reward formulation capturing user intent and bias reduction, and how user corrections translate into learning signals are not specified. This clarity is crucial to evaluate the soundness and implementability of the method effectively. Consider specifying the RL architecture or algorithmic approach and how it interoperates with the language model outputs in real-time to ensure the method is rigorous and well-founded in theory and practice, not just conceptually attractive but also operationally feasible and robust against noisy corrections or malicious inputs, especially in high-stakes financial contexts where trust and correctness are fundamental. This will also help clarify underlying assumptions about user behavior and system adaptability inherent to the proposed interactive correction framework in the finance domain, thus reducing risk and increasing confidence in the proposed system's effectiveness and scalability in real financial workflows, beyond just a prototype or pilot setting.  This is a critical step before moving into experimentation and deployment phases, as it directly affects the system's performance and user trust, which are core to the research contribution and impact claims made in your proposal.  Please elaborate on the RL-based mechanism with technical depth in the 'Proposed_Method' section to strengthen soundness and credibility of the approach overall.  This enhancement will also inform more focused experiment designs and evaluation metrics aligned with the claimed benefits of trust-building and bias mitigation through interactive corrections by finance experts, thereby sharpening the distinct novelty claim beyond existing human-in-the-loop learning literature for bias correction in LLMs within finance or similar domains.  Detailed algorithmic clarity is therefore essential for reviewers and practitioners to fully assess and reproduce your methodological contributions and build upon them in future work, mitigating the current risk of ambiguity or overgeneralization inherent from the high-level description provided currently.  This is the highest priority refinement needed to advance the research idea to a competitive and impactful stage suitable for premier conference acceptance and real-world adoption potential.  Addressing this will also help delineate limitations and assumptions explicitly, enabling a more nuanced discussion of feasibility and expected outcomes under different user interaction scenarios, which appears currently lacking but crucial for the interactive bias correction paradigm you propose."

          "feedback_content": "Given the 'NOV-COMPETITIVE' novelty verdict and the presence of globally linked concepts like 'AI Act', 'cybersecurity framework', and 'intelligent decision-making', a concrete suggestion is to integrate regulatory compliance and security-aware feedback into the interactive bias correction system. Specifically, extend the interface to incorporate real-time checks against financial AI regulations (e.g., transparency and fairness requirements mandated by the emerging AI Act in high-income countries) and detect security-related anomalies in generated outputs. This could involve fusing information from an AI compliance rule base and cybersecurity threat detection modules to not only correct biases but also ensure outputs meet legal and security standards dynamically. Leveraging 'information fusion techniques' and 'real-time threat detection' concepts within the feedback mechanism would substantially broaden both novelty and impact. This integration could empower finance professionals to correct not only bias but also flag outputs violating compliance or security policies, making the system a comprehensive intelligent decision-making assistant aligned with critical infrastructure protection requirements in financial services. Such an approach elevates the research beyond current human-in-the-loop bias correction, positioning it as a systemic risk mitigation tool for finance LLMs subject to regulatory and security constraints, thus carving a distinct and highly relevant research niche with strong multidisciplinary appeal for top-tier venues."
