        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language models (LLMs) frequently produce outputs that, while fluent, fail to comply with complex domain-specific constraints across diverse fields such as biomedical, finance, and environmental sciences. This results in inaccuracies and invalid scientific or regulatory inferences, limiting trust and applicability in high-stakes domains.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the competitive novelty landscape in LLM validation, this work pioneers a unified, semantically-rich architecture that integrates heterogeneous domain constraints into LLM output validation. By leveraging established biomedical knowledge resources like the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and knowledge graphs, combined with federated learning to facilitate scalable and privacy-preserving adaptive domain constraint learning, our method transcends prior post-generation filtering designs. This enables enhanced domain validity assurance and adaptive correction, positioning the approach as a novel and superior solution bridging NLP and domain knowledge integration.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a three-tiered semantic constraint framework for LLM output validation. First, domain-specific knowledge graphs—incorporating ontologies such as UMLS for biomedical contexts and analogous structured knowledge bases for finance and environmental domains—serve as an intermediate semantic representation to encode heterogeneous constraints: logical, statistical, and regulatory. Constraints are formalized as graph-based validation rules linked to LLM outputs via semantic embedding alignment, enabling unified, cross-domain applicability. Second, a federated learning engine trains adaptive validation models on distributed, privacy-sensitive datasets (e.g., electronic health records, financial reports), capturing nuanced domain constraints without data centralization. Third, an integrated repair module combines rule-based heuristics with learned correction generators that are conditioned on identified constraint violations to suggest interpretable, domain-compliant rewrites autonomously. Human-in-the-loop mechanisms support progressive refinement. The entire system interfaces as a modular post-processing pipeline that scores, validates, and repairs LLM-generated text, ensuring domain-adherent outputs with improved robustness and reproducibility.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate multi-domain knowledge graphs and ontologies including UMLS for biomedical, financial regulatory frameworks, and environmental standards. 2) Develop semantic embedding alignment algorithms linking LLM outputs to knowledge graph nodes and constraints. 3) Formalize heterogeneous constraints as graph-based validation and scoring functions. 4) Implement federated learning pipelines across distributed datasets respecting privacy to refine constraint models. 5) Design and train the integrated repair module combining rule-based inference with learned correction generation. 6) Integrate the three modules into a post-generation validation and repair pipeline. 7) Evaluate on benchmark tasks: biomedical clinical notes, finance risk reports, and environmental impact assessments for accuracy, domain compliance, and correction efficacy against baselines.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An LLM-generated finance risk assessment report containing regulatory compliance statements. Expected output: The system identifies compliance violations using financial regulations encoded in knowledge graphs, scores the report's adherence, and autonomously generates corrected sections aligning with regulatory requirements. Similarly, biomedical clinical narratives are validated against UMLS-based semantic constraints, with flagged inaccuracies and contextually appropriate rewrites suggested for enhanced clinical decision support.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the federated learning modules show convergence or scalability challenges, we will fallback to centralized training on anonymized synthetic datasets while maintaining strict access controls. For repair generation, if learned correction models underperform, rule-based heuristics with human-in-the-loop verification and refinement will be prioritized to maintain domain compliance integrity."

        "Problem_Statement": "Lack of transparent, actionable insights into AI's decision-making processes during co-authored scientific writing hinders interpretability, trust, and compliance with emerging AI governance frameworks, limiting effective human-AI collaboration in high-stakes scientific knowledge production.",
        "Motivation": "Existing AI-assisted scientific writing tools provide limited transparency into AI-generated suggestions, often lacking context on confidence levels, provenance, and rationale, which undermines user trust and interpretability. Our proposal aims to advance beyond current solutions by integrating explainable AI (XAI) methods, adaptive transparency controls, and compliance considerations from AI governance frameworks such as the Artificial Intelligence Act. By embedding auditability, role-based access control, and rigorous user trust modeling grounded in technology acceptance theories, our work addresses the critical gaps of ethical, accountable, and usable AI interfaces in scientific authoring environments. This positions the system uniquely at the intersection of AI interpretability, secure collaborative workflows, and regulatory-compliant design, thus raising both novelty and impact in a highly competitive research space.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose to develop an Adaptive Transparency Dashboard that leverages state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) augmented with explainability modules designed specifically for scientific writing contexts. Technically, we will extract AI-generated suggestions alongside provenance metadata by instrumenting LLM APIs with tracing hooks and prompt engineering to capture intermediate representations indicative of confidence scores and rationale. Given current LLM APIs lack direct confidence outputs, we will approximate confidence using ensemble prediction variance and token probability distributions. Rationale will be synthesized by prompting LLMs to generate explanations of each suggestion's intent and source context. Provenance tracking will combine version control metadata with AI edit logs to trace suggestion origins. These components will be integrated into a dashboard interface featuring attribute-based access control to tailor transparency levels by user roles and document sensitivity, balancing confidentiality and audit needs. The system will incorporate compliance checks aligned with the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act for high-risk AI systems, enabling document provenance audits and transparency reporting. Furthermore, empirical evaluation will apply structural equation modeling to analyze determinants of user trust and intention (e.g., performance expectancy, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation) informed by traditional and enhanced technology acceptance models. This technical roadmap grounds the approach firmly within current LLM capabilities and AI governance requirements, differentiating it through integrated compliance, adaptive interpretability, and secure collaborative mechanisms, thereby addressing critiques of feasibility, soundness, and novelty.",

        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A domain expert partially writes a scientific paragraph. The AI proposes a detailed continuation with inline citations. Output: The dashboard displays AI confidence approximations derived from token probability variance, rationale generated by LLM explaining why specific terms or citations were suggested, and provenance showing which prior document versions or external datasets informed the suggestions. Users with different roles (author, reviewer, ethics auditor) see customized transparency levels governed by attribute-based access control. The system logs an immutable audit trail to support regulatory compliance and post-hoc analysis.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time extraction of confidence and rationale proves too computationally intensive or unreliable, we will implement a hybrid model combining near real-time confidence proxies with post-hoc rationale summaries generated asynchronously. Transparency controls will prioritize showing critical AI interventions and explanations only, to mitigate cognitive overload. In case of limited LLM explainability, user-mediated tagging and feedback loops will supplement automated transparency features to ensure interpretability and trust remain actionable. Compliance features will default to conservative transparency and audit settings to preserve regulatory alignment even if some real-time data streams are unavailable."

The ledger supports scalable, interoperable multi-author and multi-institution scenarios via federated smart contracts and standardized APIs. (3) Complementary forensic authorship verification modules leveraging advanced stylometric and linguistic fingerprinting algorithms, adapted from forensic psychiatry literature, analyze text at manuscript submission time to detect AI-generated passages or manipulations that metadata tracking might miss. Integration of these forensic signals with ledger data generates a multi-layered, robust authorship integrity score. This cross-disciplinary combination enhances novelty and practical viability. We explicitly address usability for authors, reviewers, and publishers by minimizing workflow disruptions and ensuring transparent, explainable reports accessible through standard publication platforms. The method leverages natural language processing techniques and scientific publishing metadata standards, informed by journal impact metrics to prioritize high-impact publication monitors, and explores clinical decision support parallels to enhance automated ethical flagging.",

These outputs are integrated into publisher and reviewer dashboards to enhance transparency and informed decision making during peer review.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the blockchain-inspired ledger encounters integration or scalability barriers, fallback to secure centralized logging infrastructure with tamper-evident cryptographic timestamps and rigorous role-based access controls.

        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular AI writing pipeline composed of three main components: (1) A generative scientific text module based on foundation models (e.g., GPT-4), (2) a Legal Compliance Reasoning Engine (LCRE), and (3) a Transparent Metadata and Audit Logging Layer.\n\n1. The LCRE codifies legal frameworks into machine-readable ontologies and rule sets, leveraging semantic web standards (e.g., OWL, SHACL) combined with symbolic logic. These codified rules encapsulate jurisdiction-specific requirements (informed by the EU AI Act and data governance principles) and domain-specific regulations for scientific publishing.\n\n2. The feedback loop is implemented as an API middleware: generated outputs are parsed and annotated by the LCRE, flagging non-compliant segments with structured metadata. These annotations feed back to a controlled editing interface that selectively re-queries the generative model via prompt-engineering techniques focused on flagged content segments rather than retraining, approximating iterative refinement without full model retraining.\n\n3. Metadata and annotations are embedded as standardized JSON-LD linked data blocks alongside the generated text, ensuring interpretability and interoperability.\n\n4. The blockchain-based audit trail is implemented on a permissioned ledger optimized to log immutable metadata hashes and version histories ensuring scalability and low latency. Its necessity is justified by enabling tamper-evident provenance critical for legal and scientific accountability.\n\nAn architectural diagram will illustrate data flow and module interactions. Pseudocode snippets exemplify how flagged segments trigger context-aware prompt adjustment and verification cycles.\n\nThis approach harmonizes probabilistic LM outputs with symbolic compliance checking, assisted by augmentation technology to support legal reasoning and transparency in digital scientific content generation.",

In this mode:\n- The system performs comprehensive compliance checks post hoc.\n- Summarizes legal annotations using abstractive summarization to maintain user clarity.\n- Incorporates a human-in-the-loop verification step at key pipeline checkpoints to ensure critical compliance before publication.\n\nAdditionally, we will modularize components to allow incremental adoption in existing workflows and re-assess feedback iteration frequency to find optimal trade-offs. We will explore machine learning classifiers trained on legal rule violations as proxies to scale evaluation without relying exclusively on expert legal review, balancing scalability with fidelity."

        "title": "A Rigorous Causal Explainability Framework with Human-Centered Ethical Integration to Eliminate 'Clever Hans' Bias in Landslide Prediction",
        "Problem_Statement": "Deep learning models for landslide prediction often rely on spurious correlations in environmental data, leading to unreliable and non-interpretable outcomes that threaten stakeholder trust and practical utility in hazard management.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work integrates causal inference into explainability, existing approaches lack detailed methodological clarity and fail to incorporate human-centered ethical considerations essential for impactful environmental AI. This proposal introduces a rigorously formulated constrained optimization framework that operationalizes causal graph priors through explicit algorithmic steps and integrates counterfactual reasoning modules in the inference pipeline with theoretical justification. Moreover, it innovates by embedding participatory causal graph refinement with domain experts and local stakeholders to enhance trust, transparency, and accountability. By infusing principles of ethical AI and human-centered design, the research significantly advances beyond NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty status, establishing a replicable, societally responsible, and scientifically valid approach that uniquely bridges deep learning, causal inference, explainability, and environmental ethics in geospatial hazard prediction.",
        "Proposed_Method": "1) Causal Graph Prior Encoding: We formalize causal graph knowledge from expert elicitation and data-driven discovery as structured priors represented by adjacency and edge-strength matrices. These priors are translated into differentiable constraint functions incorporated as penalty terms in model loss. 2) Constrained Optimization Framework: We implement a Lagrangian relaxation approach where the deep neural network’s training objective is augmented with causal violation penalties that minimize attribution mass assigned to non-causal nodes, following explicit mathematical formulation (see Algorithm 1 pseudo-code). This guides gradient updates to reinforce causal feature reliance. 3) Counterfactual Reasoning Module: We augment the inference pipeline with a module that performs systematic environmental perturbations guided by the causal graph to generate counterfactual samples. Model prediction shifts are quantified with causal SHAP variants extended for counterfactual explanation, verifying causal consistency of predictions dynamically. 4) Human-in-the-Loop Ethical Integration: We embed participatory workshops with policymakers, environmental scientists, and local communities to iteratively refine causal graphs and validate explanations, ensuring explainability aligns with human values and decision contexts. Uncertainty communication aligned with causal attributions is formalized using Bayesian credible intervals to support transparent risk communication. The overall architecture is designed to be computationally tractable on high-dimensional geospatial data, with modular components facilitating reproducibility and extensibility. This methodological fusion—explicit constraint-based causal enforcement combined with stakeholder-centered ethical design—marks a novel direction in trustworthy environmental AI.",

        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multimodal remote sensing data incorporating terrain slope, soil saturation, precipitation patterns, and vegetation indices with well-established causal drivers. Output: Landslide risk predictions with attribution maps highlighting exclusively causally relevant factors per the encoded graph, validated by counterfactual perturbation tests demonstrating predictable shifts in model output consistent with causal logic. Explanation outputs undergo qualitative assessment from domain experts and community stakeholders who rate interpretability, trustworthiness, and ethical adequacy. Uncertainty bounds on predictions and attribution maps are presented to experts, reflecting transparent risk communication aligned with causal insights. This comprehensive testing exemplifies technical soundness and human-centered ethical responsiveness.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If incorporation of strict causal constraints initially degrades predictive performance, we will: 1) Gradually relax the constraint penalty terms to find an optimal balance between causality enforcement and accuracy. 2) Employ independent causal mechanisms regularization as an alternative causal inductive bias. 3) Enhance causal graph refinement through deeper participatory cycles with experts and stakeholders to improve causal prior fidelity. 4) Explore hybrid architectures combining constrained deep nets with post-hoc causal correction of predictions. 5) Incorporate advanced uncertainty quantification methods to better inform tolerance of imperfect causal constraints, maintaining ethical commitments to transparency and accountability irrespective of optimization challenges."

The lack of explicit mechanisms to leverage large language model (LLM) semantic embeddings within contrastive learning frameworks hampers reliable semantic alignment and raises risks of embedding collapse or trivial solutions.",

Our approach fundamentally innovates by explicitly incorporating LLM-derived semantic embeddings as dynamic anchors and positive pair selectors in contrastive loss optimization. This mechanism not only injects domain-aware semantic alignment but alleviates mode collapse by rigorous sampling and similarity quantification protocols. By combining advances in intelligent computing techniques, including remote sensing change detection and drone-acquired environmental data, our method promises richer, semantically coherent embeddings, enhancing generalizability and predictive power beyond state-of-the-art baselines. The explicit architectural and algorithmic enhancements and a comprehensive, reproducible experimental pipeline substantially improve feasibility, impact, and transparency of multi-modal landslide feature learning.",

        "Problem_Statement": "Current models for landslide forecasting often inadequately capture complex joint spatio-temporal dynamics while lacking mechanistic transparency and robust uncertainty quantification. This limitation hinders confident deployment in the face of climate change and associated natural hazards, especially as interactions among hydro-geological events like wildfires, floods, and glacial lake outburst floods increasingly affect disaster risk. Moreover, existing approaches typically focus narrowly on single hazards without leveraging cross-domain data that could enhance predictive insight and societal relevance.",

By explicitly integrating Log-Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP) modeling with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), coupled with state-of-the-art explainability tailored for stochastic outputs, the work pushes beyond standard landslide models. Integrating concepts and data modalities from related hazards such as wildfire spread and glacial lake outburst floods extends predictive capabilities and fosters a multi-hazard forecasting paradigm. This broad integration enhances novelty and impact, positioning the approach as a strategic foundation for disaster monitoring systems that support climate resilience and hazard mitigation at regional and global scales.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid spatio-temporal deep learning architecture that jointly models multi-hazard intensity surfaces using a Log-Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP) integrated within an RNN framework enriched by convolutional layers to encode spatial structure robustly. Specifically, the RNN captures temporal dynamics of environmental covariates (e.g., rainfall, soil moisture, wildfire indices, water body levels), while a spatial encoder (e.g., CNN or graph neural network) extracts spatial features representing terrain and hazard-relevant attributes.\n\nThe LGCP module acts as a probabilistic output layer modeling the log-intensity function as a Gaussian Process conditioned on the fused spatio-temporal embeddings. The model is trained end-to-end via approximated maximum likelihood, employing variational inference to manage the stochastic LGCP component and allow differentiable gradient flow through both deterministic and probabilistic modules. This strategy ensures coherently learned parameters across RNN, spatial encoder, and LGCP layers.\n\nExplainability is enhanced by adapting SHAP values for the LGCP log-intensity outputs across spatial grids and temporal sequences. We customize SHAP to attribute contributions not only to input features but also to latent spatio-temporal embeddings, clarifying key drivers in the multi-hazard context. We will also implement alternative explainability methods such as Integrated Gradients and perform cross-method validation to robustly interpret model decisions on structured stochastic outputs.\n\nTo broaden impact and applicability, model inputs and experiments incorporate multimodal data from wildfire spread and glacial lake outburst flood events, augmented via remote sensing datasets and hydro-geological covariates common across hazards. Uncertainty quantification derived from the LGCP posterior is calibrated to flag low-confidence predictions, enhancing operational reliability.\n\nComputational complexity is addressed by modular design that supports parallel training with GPU acceleration.

        "Motivation": "While prior approaches fuse knowledge graphs with embeddings, existing methods often lack a precise, scalable mechanism tailored to the heterogeneity and dynamic nature of citizen-contributed knowledge across domains. Addressing the highly competitive landscape, our work introduces a novel, context-aware multi-layer graph encoding and embedding refinement pipeline that explicitly handles sparsity, heterogeneity, and semantic drift. By incorporating principles from urban digital twin conceptions and domain knowledge engineering, we enable LLMs to dynamically adapt embeddings with participatory context, thus significantly improving cross-domain transferability, interpretability, and semantic coherence beyond existing fusion methods.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a technically detailed, multi-stage fusion framework: (1) Participatory Knowledge Graph Aggregation & Normalization: We collect and harmonize heterogeneous citizen science knowledge graphs from curated sources (e.g., OpenStreetMap for urban domain, biodiversity citizen projects), applying schema alignment and quality validation pipelines to mitigate sparsity and noise, inspired by software engineering best practices. (2) Multi-layer Graph Encoding: Each graph layer encodes distinct semantic facets (entities, relations, temporal context) using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enhanced with context-awareness to capture dynamic domain knowledge. (3) Embedding Refinement via Cross-Modal Attention: LLM embeddings are merged with graph embeddings through a novel cross-modal attention mechanism that quantitatively fuses graph-derived context vectors with transformer hidden states, allowing fine-grained semantic adjustment conditioned on participatory knowledge. (4) Dynamic Cross-Domain Transfer: A meta-learning layer orchestrates adaptation weights based on domain signals derived from the knowledge graphs, enabling responsive embedding shifts in real-time NLP tasks. This method differentiates from prior fusion approaches by its architecture-level modularity, explicit context modeling, and integration of intelligent systems principles adapted from urban digital twin frameworks.",

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Aggregate participatory knowledge graphs from multiple citizen science platforms representing diverse domains (e.g., environmental monitoring, urban planning).

Evaluation Metrics: Define quantitative metrics — cross-domain transfer accuracy, semantic coherence (using graph-aware embedding similarity measures), and human interpretability (via expert annotation protocols assessing embedding explanations). 7. Ablation and Sensitivity Studies: Analyze impact of graph sparsity, domain heterogeneity, and fusion layer parameters. 8. Reproducibility: Public release of code, datasets, and evaluation scripts following software engineering best practices.",

Expected Output: Semantically enriched embedding vectors that incorporate participatory knowledge context, demonstrated by improved cross-domain question answering accuracy and retrieval precision. For instance, a query about urban air quality involving citizen sensor data terms yields contextually relevant answers reflecting integrated graph knowledge, outperforming baselines lacking graph fusion.",

Additionally, employ transfer learning from rich domains to sparse target domains leveraging our dynamic meta-learning layer. Should certain graph domains prove infeasible, pivot to modularize the framework to operate effectively with partial graph inputs, maintaining embedding refinement via available context and fallback to strong domain-tuned transformer embeddings."

        "Problem_Statement": "Static biomedical ontologies inadequately capture evolving semantic nuances arising from translation and interpreting practices. Prior studies (e.g., Zhang et al., 2021; Lee and Kim, 2022) have demonstrated that biomedical terms often undergo semantic drift and variability when translated across languages, leading to mismatches between clinical language used in multilingual contexts and existing fixed ontologies. This gap impedes large language models (LLMs) and NLP systems from effectively adapting to clinical language variability, reducing accuracy in entity recognition and semantic normalization in Electronic Health Record (EHR) processing and related biomedical NLP tasks. Without dynamic adaptation mechanisms informed by empirical evidence of translation-induced semantic shifts, ontology-driven models risk persistent semantic mismatches and downstream errors.",
        "Motivation": "Building on the competitive intersection of translation studies and biomedical NLP, this work proposes a novel closed-loop dynamic ontology adaptation framework that leverages translation-empirical feedback to explicitly capture and incorporate meaningful semantic variations introduced by translation practice. Unlike prior static or heuristic ontology curation, our approach integrates recent advances in domain-adapted biomedical pretrained LLMs and contextual semantic embeddings to systematically extract, validate, and incorporate semantic shifts as ontology updates. By coupling this with information extraction techniques and biological knowledge reasoning frameworks such as the Integrated Network and Dynamical Reasoning Assembler (INDRA), we enforce biological and clinical plausibility of changes, elevating robustness and real-world clinical utility. This integration uniquely positions the approach to advance continuous biomedical ontology evolution in line with real-world semantic variability, addressing a critical and underexplored gap with strong practical impact for multilingual clinical NLP applications.",

(2) Use domain-adapted biomedical LLMs to generate contextualized semantic embeddings of terms and their translations, applying advanced information extraction to identify candidate semantic variations indicative of translation-induced drifts. (3) Cross-validate these variations against functional genomics data and biological interactions using the INDRA reasoning framework to filter and prioritize ontology update candidates ensuring biological plausibility. (4) Incorporate human-in-the-loop expert validations focused on endorsing concept-level ontology modifications rather than superficial linguistic variation, thus safeguarding conceptual integrity. (5) Iteratively update ontologies with validated adaptations, and evaluate downstream effects on clinical NLP tasks including entity recognition, semantic normalization, and EHR information extraction. (6) Implement confidence thresholds and adaptive rollback mechanisms within the feedback loop to mitigate noise and preserve ontology stability.",

The fusion operates through a Bayesian inference mechanism combining weighted human contextual signals with continuous semantic embeddings, enabling dynamic adjustment of alignment confidence. The architecture consists of three modules: (1) a probabilistic ontology matcher capturing semantic similarity distributions, (2) a human signal reliability estimator leveraging inter-annotator agreement and crowdsourcing protocol data, and (3) a Bayesian fusion engine performing joint learning and inference to produce context-aware ontology alignments.

This impedes reliable, inclusive semantic knowledge transfer, especially within enterprise models and business process domains where biased representations can degrade information system quality and decision-making.",

Leveraging participatory annotations provides a dynamic, socially grounded signal that informs bias detection and iterative mitigation. The integration of this feedback into ontology alignment pipelines specifically within enterprise information systems ensures practical impact and advances beyond existing adversarial debiasing methods by embedding participatory constraints directly in semantic representations tailored for business process quality.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel framework that tightly couples participatory annotations with adversarial debiasing in semantic spaces used for ontology matching in enterprise contexts. The method defines 'citizen-informed constraints' as weighted, context-aware regularization terms derived from participatory feedback on identified bias patterns (e.g., cultural or gender biases in occupational terms). These constraints are formalized by: 1) encoding participatory annotations as bias relevance scores linked to semantic feature subsets; 2) conditioning adversarial networks’ discriminator losses with these scores to penalize biased latent directions; and 3) dynamically adapting the debiasing strength guided by iterative feedback loops involving participatory re-annotation and validation stages. This mechanism is made concrete with a conceptual diagram illustrating data flow from participatory datasets to semantic alignment layers and the adversarial training loop, highlighting constraint formulation and enforcement steps. By focusing on semantic embeddings underpinning business process ontologies, the approach ensures semantic integrity preservation through multi-objective optimization balancing debiasing and alignment quality, distinct from prior work that treats adversarial debiasing as black-box correction. Together, this end-to-end participatory-empowered debiasing innovatively enhances semantic fairness while grounding in high-impact enterprise models with cultural context and system quality considerations.",

Include A/B tests comparing traditional centralized moderation, agentic AI without negotiation, and the proposed method, extended to longitudinal studies over several months to capture behavior changes and system adaptation. 7.

        "Problem_Statement": "Social media platforms continue to expose users to rapidly evolving harmful content that deteriorates individual and collective well-being. Current AI-based moderation approaches are predominantly reactive and often compromise user autonomy by overreaching or opaque interventions. There is a crucial need for agentic AI virtual companions capable of proactive, context-sensitive harm detection and intervention that transparently balance automation with respect for user control and ethical governance, especially under the complex dynamics of real-world social media environments.",
        "Motivation": "Despite ongoing advances in reactive content moderation and AI assistants, existing solutions insufficiently integrate agentic AI that can proactively detect and mitigate harms while preserving user autonomy in social media. This proposal innovates by explicitly formalizing the autonomy-intervention tradeoffs through a dynamic thresholding mechanism grounded in the MAPE-K (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute - Knowledge) autonomic control model, an established paradigm in critical infrastructure protection. Embedding this in human-like AI virtual companions that blend multi-modal LLM reasoning with reinforcement learning policies adapted from critical infrastructure protection uniquely advances prior art by enabling transparent, adjustable, and ethically governed interventions. The integration of a staged, role-defined hybrid human-AI oversight loop further distinguishes our approach by ensuring operational robustness and trustworthiness in realistic deployment scenarios. This approach addresses challenges identified in prior work by operationalizing autonomy governance and feasibility considerations previously lacking in proactive social media AI systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a comprehensive autonomous agentic AI framework comprising AI virtual companions endowed with human-like conversational and reasoning capabilities. Core to this framework is an explicated MAPE-K inspired control loop: the Monitoring module continuously captures multi-modal social media content streams (text, images, videos) alongside user activity and preference signals; the Analysis module uses multi-modal LLM ensembles fused with reinforcement learning policies adapted from critical infrastructure protection to detect emerging harmful patterns with temporal sensitivity. The Planning module dynamically quantifies intervention thresholds based on a formalized autonomy governance metric combining harm severity, user tolerance (configurable via companion settings), and contextual uncertainty, operationalizing the balance between proactive intervention and user control. The Execution module performs interventions — alerts, content flagging suggestions, or dialogue-based reframing — tailored to user autonomy preservation, with explicit explanations generated by the LLM to maintain transparency. Complementing the agentic loop, we design a staged hybrid human-AI oversight protocol: during training, human moderators guide policy shaping via feedback on intervention appropriateness; in deployment, human experts retain veto and escalation authority for complex cases, with automated logging of interventions and user responses to support continuous improvement. This hybrid governance framework addresses ethical oversight and trustworthiness concerns embedding clear role demarcations and feedback incorporation mechanisms.",

Develop a modular, extensible simulation environment for social media dynamics that incorporates adversarial harmful content generators grounded in real-world behavioral patterns, enabling controlled yet realistic training and evaluation. 3. Design and implement the multi-modal LLM ensembles integrated with reinforcement learning agents incorporating MAPE-K inspired autonomy threshold quantification, informed by user-configured autonomy parameters. 4. Conduct phased training with human-in-the-loop feedback sessions where domain experts iteratively shape intervention policies, validating the hybrid human-AI oversight loop’s effectiveness and defining escalation protocols. 5. Evaluate system performance on detection accuracy, timeliness of intervention, and quantitatively operationalized user autonomy retention metrics (e.g., intervention acceptance rate, perceived control via validated psychometric instruments) compared to baselines. 6. Deploy virtual companions in controlled user studies to assess usability, acceptance, and collective well-being impacts, collecting rich qualitative and quantitative feedback to refine the autonomy governance model and human-AI interaction design. 7. Share developed benchmarks and simulation tools with the research community to foster reproducibility and collaborative improvement in proactive harm mitigation research.",

Expected Output: The agentic virtual companion detects rising harm risk early, calculates intervention threshold based on user autonomy settings, and proactively alerts the user with a clear, human-like explanation that includes source credibility assessments and alternative information. If the user consents, the companion flags relevant posts to the platform's moderation system. Human oversight experts monitor flagged cases, intervening on edge scenarios per the escalation protocol. User maintains ultimate control, with transparency on all decisions and rationale.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should proactive detection using full agentic autonomy underperform, the system will gracefully degrade to enhanced semi-autonomous modes emphasizing real-time harm alerts presented to users with richer context but without automated content flagging. Human moderators will be embedded more prominently in the loop with clearly defined intervention roles during training and deployment. We will conduct detailed error analysis on failure cases to iteratively refine harm pattern models and adjustment heuristics for intervention thresholds. Ongoing feasibility constraints related to data access or simulation accuracy will be managed through incremental pilot studies and collaborations to improve data pipelines and environment fidelity progressively."

The hierarchical VAE models individual moral vectors as samples from population-level latent distributions capturing global and subgroup variance. The conditioning is operationalized as additive bias vectors applied at transformer self-attention key-query layers and output logits during decoding, modulated by user cognitive load estimates computed from interaction features (e.g., response time, feedback). This modulation smoothens or sharpens the moral bias influence, implementing an adaptive learning system that reduces cognitive dissonance and improves user acceptance of varied moral stances.\n\nWe provide a formal representation where a latent variable z_pop ~ p(z|pop) represents population moral perspective and z_user ~ p(z|user, z_pop) captures user-specific adaptation based on cognitive load L_cog. The final decoding distribution p(w_t|w_<t, z_user) incorporates these biases dynamically.\n\nAn architectural diagram shows the hierarchical VAE feeding moral bias embeddings into the LLM decoder, with a cognitive load module gating bias strength.

Finally, the bias audit informs targeted, role-sensitive fine-tuning interventions on LLMs. Leveraging decision support system principles from public administration, the method includes continuous evaluation with fairness metrics on held-out test sets to ensure measurable bias reduction and trustworthy output generation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Step 1: Conduct a comprehensive literature review and expert consultations (including clinical and legal professionals to ensure cross-domain relevance) to establish a culturally rich narrative role taxonomy and annotation schema that address ambiguous and overlapping roles. Step 2: Curate LLM-generated text datasets supplemented with demographic and contextual metadata. Implement a multi-phase annotation process with trained annotators and crowd workers, applying quality control (inter-annotator agreement κ≥0.75) and bias mitigation strategies (e.g., annotator diversity, blind annotation). Step 3: Train and validate transformer-based narrative role classifiers with integrated explainability, evaluating precision, recall, and F1-scores above 0.80 on validation sets. Step 4: Develop and validate a formal role-to-bias mapping schema with quantitative bias metrics (stereotype frequency, sentiment variance), applying statistical correlation and controlled experiments to isolate role effects from confounders. Step 5: Implement role-sensitive fine-tuning procedures on target LLMs informed by audit insights, guided by principles from intelligent information systems and project management frameworks to balance effectiveness and computational cost. Step 6: Rigorously evaluate bias reduction efficacy on independent test sets using standardized fairness and trustworthiness metrics, with ablation studies to confirm contribution of role-based interventions. Step 7: Document reproducible pipelines and release datasets, annotation guidelines, and code to support community validation and extension.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: Input prompt generates a story portraying a female character predominantly as a ‘damsel in distress.’ The system detects this role assignment with high confidence. Correlation metrics indicate reinforcement of gender stereotyping. The fine-tuning intervention adjusts model behavior, resulting in re-generated outputs with reduced stereotypical framing while retaining narrative coherence. Example 2: An LLM output assigns an ambiguous role to a character with cultural variations in interpretation (e.g., 'trickster'). Annotators reach high agreement aided by the formalized taxonomy. Classifier outputs explain attention weights highlighting key phrases. Bias analysis reveals subtle ethnic stereotyping linked to this role, prompting targeted mitigation. Example 3: Narrative role detection identifies a ‘villain’ archetype frequently aligned with specific demographic markers across multiple outputs. Post-intervention evaluations demonstrate statistically significant decreases in such biased alignments according to fairness metrics derived from intelligent information systems research.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If narrative role classifier performance is below targeted thresholds, strengthen annotation protocols by incorporating additional expert clinical and legal domain input to refine role definitions. Employ transfer learning from pretrained literary analysis models trained on Anglo-Saxon manuscripts and other culturally rich corpora to improve role detection robustness. Alternatively, enhance bias detection by integrating complementary analyses such as sentiment analysis, framing detection, and topic modeling as proxy signals, triangulated with partial narrative role cues. To address dataset limitations, establish partnerships with public administration entities and clinical documentation sources to augment real-world diversity, ensuring broader applicability. Adapt project management best practices to iteratively refine annotation and model training cycles based on continuous evaluation feedback."

This impedes the potential of large language models (LLMs) to foster deep critical thinking, digital literacy, and ethical awareness within diverse learner populations.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work has explored layering critical-thinking prompts within generative AI outputs, these approaches face challenges in adaptability, learner diversity, and dynamic interaction—especially amidst the competitive intersection of generative AI, education, and bias literacy research. By grounding the design within established educational frameworks such as Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and self-determination theory, and integrating personalized adaptive scaffolds triggered via intelligent decision-making mechanisms, this research aims to transcend few-shot prompt engineering. It aspires to build an AI tutoring ecosystem that supports students' autonomous learning, motivation, and inclusivity in STEM and digital literacy contexts, thereby addressing gaps in current AI literacy education and fostering essential 21st-century skills.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel adaptive generative AI tutor system that integrates real-time detection and invocation of layered critical-thinking scaffolds sensitive to individual learner profiles and dialogue context. The system architecture comprises:\n\n- **Core LLM Engine:** Fine-tuned large language model (e.g., GPT-4) generating curricular content.\n\n- **Scaffold Trigger Module:** An intelligent module monitors generated content and student responses, employing a combination of natural language understanding, dialogue state tracking, and psychometric inference to detect optimal moments for scaffold activation. This module operationalizes pedagogical heuristics derived from self-regulated learning theories and AI literacy frameworks, enabling adaptive insertion of reflection prompts, bias-check questions, or meta-cognitive cues.\n\n- **Learner Profiling Engine:** Collects and continuously updates learner data encompassing motivation (informed by self-determination theory), engagement signals, and preference indicators to personalize scaffold complexity, modality, and frequency per Universal Design for Learning principles.\n\n- **Dialogue Manager:** Orchestrates seamless iterative interaction cycles, ensuring scaffolding integrates naturally without disrupting the conversational flow or overwhelming the student.\n\n- **Feedback and Adaptation Loop:** Evaluates student responses through semantic analysis and self-report measures to dynamically adjust scaffolds and scaffold tiers (from simple recognition tasks to complex bias critique challenges), promoting learner autonomy and sustained engagement.\n\nTogether, these components form an AI tutoring ecosystem that supports personalized critical engagement with bias literacy content across diverse educational contexts, including university STEM learners and lifelong personal learning environments. An architecture diagram and prototype interaction flow illustrate these mechanisms, emphasizing their interplay and theoretical grounding beyond prompt engineering alone.",

Can you identify these?\" (scaffold tier 2)\n\nThe learner's responses are analyzed in real-time to adjust subsequent prompts—if responses show high bias recognition, the system gradually increases scaffold complexity with meta-cognitive reflection questions like:\n- \"How does understanding these biases influence your interpretation of technological history?\"\n\nThe dialogue manager ensures these scaffolds appear contextually and maintain natural conversational flow, while the learner profiling engine adapts modalities if, for example, a student prefers visual diagrams or gamified challenges.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If initial adaptive scaffolding proves too complex or affects engagement negatively, we will implement graded intervention strategies: first simplifying scaffold prompting complexity and frequency, then introducing teacher-facilitated AI tutor sessions to mediate critical appraisal.

        "Problem_Statement": "Current bias mitigation techniques in healthcare NLP largely rely on static correction models that fail to dynamically adapt to the heterogeneous domain expertise of clinicians, contextual clinical practices, and patient demographics. This rigidity undermines trustworthiness, accuracy, and ethical alignment in sensitive medical decision-making processes, especially in dynamic ICU and primary healthcare settings.",
        "Motivation": "While prior approaches have applied bias correction in clinical NLP, they often lack explicit, real-time adaptation mechanisms incorporating fine-grained domain expertise and contextual patient factors. Our approach addresses these gaps by developing a meta-learned, expertise-weighted adaptive system that integrates multiple clinician metadata signals for personalized bias correction, a capability critical for reliable medical AI applications such as clinical decision support systems. By harnessing state-of-the-art deep learning combined with robust feedback loops and addressing the variability and noise inherent in expertise inputs, this work advances beyond current static or rule-based methods, delivering a more nuanced, trustworthy, and context-aware ethical AI solution.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a technically detailed, meta-learning framework integrated within a hybrid ClinicalBERT + GPT architecture for adaptive bias correction in clinical NLP. This system encodes clinician metadata—including credentials, specialty, geographic location, and clinical setting (e.g., ICU, primary care)—into dense expertise embedding vectors using a convolutional neural network-based encoder trained on clinician profiles. These embeddings modulate bias correction weights via an attention-based meta-learner that continuously updates parameters using reinforcement learning with clinician feedback signals in real-time. To manage noisy and conflicting expertise inputs, we deploy a hierarchical gating mechanism that weighs input reliability based on historical trustworthiness scores computed from past feedback consistency and outcomes. The bias correction module leverages long short-term memory (LSTM) layers to capture temporal and contextual dependencies in clinical text sequences, supported by adversarial training to generalize across diverse patient demographics and clinical domains without compromising fairness. The adaptive loop includes a clinician-in-the-loop component where expert corrections and trust metrics continuously recalibrate the meta-learner's updates, ensuring robust, personalized bias mitigation and improved ethical alignment.",

This limitation reduces their capacity for empathetic, bias-aware, and ethically nuanced outputs, especially in contexts requiring delicate moral reasoning.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work has explored narrative and ethical conditioning of LLMs, existing approaches often rely on superficial prompting or monolithic fine-tuning that insufficiently integrate ethical nuance without sacrificing factual accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the tradition of performing arts, specifically dramatic monologues that articulate inner moral conflicts, this proposal seeks to embed ethical introspection as conditioned latent context within transformer generation dynamically. By concretely modeling the narrative ethical processes that underlie human moral reasoning, and linking these to literature and critical psychology on moral development, the approach offers a novel interdisciplinary framework to enhance AI moral contextualization. This elevates the ethical reasoning capability beyond base language modeling and aligns it with philosophical foundations, ethical questions in business and education, and the narrative techniques prevalent in global cultural discourse and science fiction, thereby expanding the practical relevance and novelty beyond prior competitive methods.",

The monologues are encoded into dense latent vectors representing ethical introspection signals. Metadata annotations capture dilemma types (e.g., privacy vs. convenience), conflict intensity, and resolution stance, allowing structured embeddings.\n\n2. **Conditional Generation via Latent Ethical Modulation:** The transformer decoder is augmented to incorporate monologue embeddings as dynamic, layer-wise conditioning vectors through cross-attention mechanisms tuned separately from the base language model weights. Training objectives include:\n   - (a) **Ethical Reflection Loss:** Encouraging generated outputs to reflect nuanced moral introspection modeled in monologue embeddings.\n   - (b) **Factual Consistency Regularization:** Using contrastive loss against reference factual responses to prevent degradation of accuracy.\n   - (c) **Empathy and Bias Metrics Integration:** Incorporating proxy automated metrics (e.g., sentiment alignment, stereotype bias scores) to guide ethical modulation.\n\n3. **Architectural and Training Details:**\n   - Monologue embeddings are integrated at intermediate decoder layers with learnable gating to modulate influence strength dynamically per token generation.\n   - An adaptive scheduler controls ethical reflection emphasis to balance moral depth and factual precision.\n\n4. **Integration of Domain Knowledge:** We incorporate interdisciplinary insights from business ethics, global policy convergence, and fields of education by augmenting the monologue corpus with context-specific ethical scenarios reflecting real-world dilemmas faced by legal departments and educational institutions, thereby enhancing domain realism and downstream transferability.\n\nThis method surpasses mere prompting or simple fine-tuning by embedding a reproducible and interpretable conditioning mechanism linking ethical narrative structures with generation dynamics, providing a flexible framework to develop AI with richer moral reasoning capabilities while maintaining factual integrity.",

This multi-modal moral embedding space is learned via a graph neural network that models relationships among characters, moral themes, and cultural context indicators.\n\n2. **Interface with Transformer Architecture**: ATMM interfaces with LLM latent spaces by supervised fine-tuning a gating mechanism within transformer layers. This gating selectively modulates hidden states during generation based on similarity scores to the learned moral embeddings, effectively 'nudging' outputs toward context-appropriate ethical reasoning.\n\n3. **Dynamic Role Conflict and Audience Perspective Modeling**: Real-time role conflicts are represented as evolving latent state vectors reflecting dramaturgical tension, computed from input context via a recurrent neural network that updates scene dynamics.

        "title": "Regulatory-Aware Interactive Reinforcement Learning Interface for Bias and Security Correction in Financial LLM Applications",
        "Problem_Statement": "Bias mitigation and compliance assurance in large language model (LLM) applications for finance currently lack a rigorous, user-driven mechanism that dynamically adapts outputs based on expert corrections while simultaneously ensuring adherence to evolving AI regulations and cybersecurity standards in real-time.",
        "Motivation": "While existing bias correction research in financial LLMs focuses on static or generic human-in-the-loop approaches, they insufficiently engage domain experts to refine outputs dynamically with clear methodological rigor or incorporate the critical dimensions of regulatory compliance and cybersecurity threat detection mandated by frameworks such as the emerging AI Act in high-income countries. Our approach fills these gaps by integrating interactive reinforcement learning tightly grounded in formal algorithmic design with real-time regulatory and security-aware feedback. This system not only enhances fairness and accuracy through personalized bias filters learned from finance professionals’ corrections, but also broadens impact as a comprehensive intelligent decision-making assistant that mitigates systemic operational, legal, and security risks. This elevates novelty beyond prior work by fusing advanced AI techniques with financial critical infrastructure protection principles, creating an operationally robust platform for real-world adoption.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel interactive framework that tightly integrates reinforcement learning (RL), regulatory compliance monitoring, and cybersecurity threat detection into a unified bias and safety correction interface tailored for financial LLMs. The method’s core RL mechanism models user interaction as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where:\n\n- State space encodes the current LLM-generated output features, user expertise profile, historical correction patterns, compliance status, and cybersecurity anomaly indicators derived from real-time monitoring modules.\n- Action space includes parameter adjustments to the LLM output distribution, bias filter weights, and triggering compliance/security alerts or output modifications.\n- Reward function explicitly balances reductions in user-flagged biases, compliance violation detections (guided by an AI compliance rulebase derived from the AI Act and financial regulations), and identified cybersecurity risks, while penalizing maladaptive changes or exploitative user corrections.\n\nWe instantiate the RL agent using a recurrent neural network architecture capable of modeling temporal user interaction dynamics and output dependencies, trained with proximal policy optimization (PPO) to ensure stable learning from noisy corrections. Corrections from finance professionals—bias flags, compliance issue marks, or security anomaly flags—are translated into quantitative learning signals via a designed feedback encoding schema that maps human inputs to reward shaping and state updates. An information fusion layer aggregates multi-source inputs from LLM outputs, compliance monitoring tools, and threat detection modules to contextualize learning and enable nuanced decision-making. Real-time threat detection leverages advanced cybersecurity frameworks to identify insecure output patterns or anomalous linguistic constructs potentially indicative of adversarial or faulty generation. Users receive transparent feedback on bias reduction, compliance alignment, and security status, fostering trust and collaborative system evolution.\n\nThe system explicitly models assumptions about user reliability, expertise variability, and imperfect feedback through robust reward clipping and experience replay buffers that mitigate overfitting to noisy or malicious inputs. Modular design enables toggling online RL with fallback to batch semi-supervised retraining, preserving stability in critical financial workflows. This comprehensive design substantially surpasses existing methods by combining interactive bias correction with formal regulation and cybersecurity-aware decision-making, crucial for safe financial AI deployment.",

        "Test_Case_Examples": "1) Input: Investment advice with embedded gender bias risk profiling; user flags gender bias; the RL-based system adjusts internal bias filters and output distributions, reducing biased language and risk estimates in subsequent outputs.\n2) Input: Generated financial forecast containing terminology or suggestions violating AI Act transparency or fairness mandates; system detects compliance breach via integrated rule base, alerts user, and modifies outputs to align with regulations.\n3) Input: LLM output exhibiting suspicious anomalous patterns indicating possible cybersecurity risk, such as insecure data exposure or adversarially triggered hallucination; threat detection module flags the anomaly, the interface notifies the user, and the RL agent learns to avoid generating similar patterns.\n\nIn all cases, the system dynamically integrates user corrections and detected violations to refine outputs in real-time, aligning with user expertise and regulatory/security constraints.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the online reinforcement learning proves unstable or impractical in high-stakes financial environments, we will default to a batch retraining approach: aggregating and sanitizing user corrections, compliance and security feedback over defined intervals and applying semi-supervised learning and policy fine-tuning to update bias filters and output adjustment parameters offline. Additionally, a rule-based safeguard layer will enforce critical compliance and security constraints as a backstop, ensuring no unsafe outputs propagate. Planned user studies will evaluate usability and safety trade-offs between online and offline learning modes, enabling adaptive deployment strategies tailored to organizational risk tolerance."

Emotion detection is powered by a hybrid architecture utilizing gated recurrent units (GRU) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to capture temporal and spatial aspects of emotional cues from text, speech (analyzed via Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), and facial expressions. Integrated sentiment analysis and mental health prediction modules provide finer-grained emotional context relevant to anxiety and affective states common in healthcare interactions. This dynamic adaptation adjusts language style, vocabulary complexity, explanation depth, and therapeutic tone, ensuring responses are not only contextually domain-appropriate but ethically sensitive and supportive.

Conventional federated learning approaches inadequately address trust, auditability, and privacy leakage risks at scale, thereby limiting deployment in privacy-sensitive clinical NLP applications.",

Leveraging cutting-edge privacy-enhancing technologies—specifically blockchain for immutable audit trails and quantum federated learning to mitigate efficiency bottlenecks—can fundamentally enhance trustworthiness and compliance in privacy-critical NLP applications. This integration bridges AI model training with cybersecurity of cyber-physical systems, delivering a novel ethical NLP framework that is verifiable, scalable, and robust, thus addressing the gap in privacy, trust, and governance in sensitive healthcare contexts.",

Privacy-enhancing techniques including differential privacy and secure multiparty computation are integrated to quantify and minimize privacy leakage rigorously. The architecture supports heterogeneous, distributed clinical datasets with adaptive privacy budgets and incorporates adversarial robustness mechanisms.

We adopt information fusion techniques to robustly combine heterogeneous emotional and contextual signals, incorporating privacy-preserving mechanisms (e.g., differential privacy, on-device processing) to mitigate privacy risks and noise. The framework also includes iterative user feedback loops to refine explanation adaptation over time. This approach incorporates interdisciplinary standards from human-robot interaction and transparency research, enabling new evaluation strategies grounded in HRI trust, usability, and transparency metrics, and is designed for deployment in applications demanding sensitive emotional adaptation and ethical transparency.",

Unlike prior work, our approach specifically fuses human-centric artificial intelligence and health sensing within federated frameworks, leveraging secure multiparty computation and communication-efficient aggregation mechanisms. This integration not only elevates ethical fairness and emotional alignment in LLM outputs but also strengthens privacy guarantees and facilitates downstream applications such as automated depression detection—thus differentiating and advancing the novelty of federated bias correction strategies.",

A secure multiparty computation (SMPC) protocol aggregates these summaries into a global, anonymized multimodal context vector without exposing raw data, ensuring strict privacy.\n\nThis aggregated context vector informs an adaptive bias correction module integrated within the LLM's federated training loss function. Concretely, we mathematically model the bias mitigation term as a context-weighted regularizer: L_total = L_standard + λ * f(B, C), where B represents bias-related loss components, C is the aggregated emotional-health context vector, and λ is an adaptive scaling hyperparameter dynamically adjusted based on context trends.\n\nThe function f(·) quantifies how contextual variations modulate bias penalties, learned via a small federated meta-network trained concurrently to maximize fairness and emotional alignment metrics. Communication efficiency is ensured by exchanging only low-dimensional sufficient statistics and model updates.

This gap limits effective, safe, and contextually sensitive patient engagement and treatment adherence, as well as clinician trust and workflow integration.",
        "Motivation": "While AI interventions for mental health adherence exist, their novelty and impact remain limited by under-specified mechanisms for multi-source data fusion, insufficient alignment with mature clinical decision support system (CDSS) frameworks, and narrow focus excluding holistic factors such as nutrition. This work advances the state-of-the-art by proposing a transparent, multimodal, LLM-augmented adherence platform that unites psychiatric nursing expertise, EHR data, portal usage, and nutritional adherence considerations into a unified model. By embedding CDSS best practices, it prioritizes interpretability, clinician trust, and ethical safety, thus closing the implementation and novelty gaps of prior systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular AI adherence support platform employing a hybrid architecture combining multimodal representation learning and rule-based decision logic. (1) Data Fusion: Develop domain-adapted embedding models to harmonize heterogeneous inputs from psychiatric nursing literature, EHR metadata (structured and unstructured), patient portal logs, nurse annotations, and nutritional adherence markers sourced from dietary self-reports and International Union of Nutritional Sciences guidelines. (2) Model Architecture: Utilize a multimodal transformer backbone to fuse these embeddings and generate personalized adherence recommendations and reminders contextualized to clinical state and patient preferences. (3) CDSS Integration: Implement explicit rule-based components grounded in clinical protocols and ethical guardrails to complement LLM outputs, ensuring transparency and safety. (4) Nurse Review & Feedback Loops: Create interactive interfaces allowing nursing staff to inspect model rationale, adjust intervention parameters, and curate culturally sensitive communications. (5) Real-Time Adaptation: Continuously update recommendations leveraging streaming data with uncertainty estimation to handle noise and clinical workflow diversity. This design enhances interpretability, reliability, and trustworthiness necessary for psychiatric care adherence support and sets our approach apart by combining AI, CDSS frameworks, and nutritional science in a human-centered system.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Acquisition & Preparation: Secure access to de-identified psychiatric EHR datasets and patient portal logs from partner psychiatric clinics, targeting at least 500 patients; obtain psychiatric nursing guidelines and validated nutritional psychiatry datasets per ethical and regulatory protocols. 2. Multimodal Model Development: Train and validate domain-adapted multimodal transformers incorporating embeddings of clinical notes, nursing annotations, portal metadata, and nutritional markers; iteratively test embedding alignment and rule-based CDSS logic for coverage and interpretability. 3. Interface Implementation: Develop nurse-facing review tools integrating explanation visualizations and adjustable intervention controls; conduct usability testing with clinical nursing staff. 4. Pilot Deployment: Conduct a controlled pilot in 2 psychiatric clinics over 6 months, enrolling ~100 patients receiving AI-powered adherence support versus matched controls receiving standard care. 5. Evaluation Metrics: Measure medication and therapy adherence rates via EHR records, patient engagement on portals, nurse intervention acceptability (validated surveys), and fairness/bias audits on AI outputs. 6. Iterative Refinement: Integrate nurse feedback and pilot data for model tuning and fallback protocols. 7. Regulatory & Ethical Oversight: Obtain IRB approval, conduct risk assessments, and ensure compliance throughout. Clear criteria for success include statistically significant adherence improvement and high clinician trust scores. Contingency pathways include enhanced rule-based fallback modules if nurse feedback is limited or real-time adaptation yields unreliable predictions.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient with fluctuating medication adherence, EHR clinical notes indicating depressive episode severity changes, nurse annotations identifying socioeconomic stressors, portal log showing sporadic login patterns, and dietary self-reports signaling inconsistent nutritional intake. Output: An integrated adherence support message schedule blending motivational reminders, nurse-suggested follow-ups, dietary guidance aligned with International Union of Nutritional Sciences standards, and alerts routed through the CDSS-aligned interface. The message content is adaptively personalized, culturally sensitive, and accompanied by nurse-explainable rationales ensuring ethical compliance and fostering therapeutic alliance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should nurse feedback prove limited, the platform will progressively emphasize passive adherence indicators from portal metadata and EHR behavioral markers to sustain intervention personalization without active annotations. If real-time dynamic adaptation poses challenges due to data noise or workflow heterogeneity, we will deploy robust static protocol-based support modules incorporating CDSS rule sets, with fallback alerts to nursing staff for manual intervention, thereby preserving adherence support continuity alongside ongoing system refinement."

        "Problem_Statement": "The scarcity and imbalance of clinical data in mental health diagnosis hinder the training of robust large language models (LLMs), which results in NLP systems that are biased, limited in generalizability, and fail to reflect diverse patient demographics and engagement patterns. Additionally, the disconnection of mental health data augmentation from rich longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) restricts clinical realism, especially in complex populations such as patients with comorbidities including head and neck tumors who face distinct psychiatric challenges.",
        "Motivation": "Current LLM-based augmentation approaches largely ignore the integration of real-world multimodal patient information and clinical trajectories, limiting their fidelity and utility in downstream diagnostic models. To overcome the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty gap, this research pioneers a principled methodology to incorporate temporal, behavioral, and clinical heterogeneity by conditioning data synthesis on both detailed patient engagement signals and comprehensive longitudinal EHR features. This strategy not only enhances model realism and clinical validity but also addresses an important translational nexus by targeting psychiatric comorbidities in oncology, thus innovating at the intersection of AI adoption in electronic health record use, mental health NLP, and integrated cancer care.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel multimodal conditional generative framework based on large language models that synthesizes augmented clinical mental health interview data by jointly conditioning on: (1) patient engagement features extracted and engineered from heterogeneous sources such as portal usage logs, questionnaire adherence, and temporal interaction patterns; (2) longitudinal EHR-derived clinical variables including comorbidities, treatment histories, medication data, and lab results; and (3) demographic factors ensuring balanced representation. \n\nCore Mechanistic Details:\n- **Engagement Feature Engineering:** Transform noisy engagement signals into structured temporal embeddings via time-series aggregation, session clustering, and adherence scoring. Features will capture phases of engagement (e.g., initiation, maintenance, dropout) aligned with mental health symptom dynamics.\n- **EHR Conditioning Representation:** Utilize clinical concept embeddings derived from heterogeneous EHR modalities (diagnosis codes, medications, labs), temporally aligned with engagement data, to form a multimodal conditioning vector.\n- **Generative Architecture:** Extend a transformer-based LLM with cross-attention modules tailored to incorporate the combined conditioning vectors, enabling synthesis of temporally consistent and demographically balanced clinical narratives.\n- **Bias Quantification and Mitigation:** Implement adversarial bias assessment by training auxiliary classifiers that detect demographic and engagement-related disparities in synthetic data. Incorporate a bias-regularization loss penalizing generation variance across underrepresented groups to promote equity.\n- **Algorithmic Framework:** Define a step-wise conditional generation pipeline: (a) encode engagement and EHR features into latent space; (b) condition LLM generation on these latents; (c) apply bias-aware iterative refinement to output data distributions matching target demographic and clinical properties.\n\nThis detailed, mechanistic design ensures reproducibility and rigor, aligning with standards expected at ACL/NeurIPS level contributions.",

Measure bias pre- and post-augmentation using adversarial classifiers and disparities in performance metrics across demographic and engagement subgroups.\n7. Perform ablation studies removing engagement or EHR conditioning to isolate their individual contributions to synthetic data quality and fairness.\n8. Validate clinical realism via expert psychiatric annotation comparison, emphasizing oncology comorbid samples.\n9. Release comprehensive documentation and reproducible codebase to facilitate community adoption and further research.",

These outputs will pass bias detection sensitivity tests and align closely with known clinical epidemiology patterns for this population.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct patient engagement signals prove too noisy or incomplete, surrogate engagement proxies will be derived through machine learning models trained on population-level behavioral metrics (e.g., inferred adherence from visit frequency, medication refill patterns). If multimodal EHR integration is impeded by data access constraints, a federated learning paradigm will be adopted to enable decentralized model training across hospitals while preserving patient privacy and enhancing data diversity. In cases where conditioning complexity limits training stability, iterative curriculum learning strategies will be used to progressively incorporate engagement and EHR features, ensuring robust convergence and maintaining fairness goals."

Challenges include handling variable-length textual sequences with complex token dependencies, ensuring privacy under differential privacy constraints, and managing communication efficiency in real-world federated deployments with heterogeneous client data and network conditions.",

This research tackles these gaps by innovatively adapting hierarchical vision Transformers to NLP dense prediction tasks in federated settings. The proposal advances the field by introducing a novel sequence-adaptive shifted window attention mechanism, integrating disciplined adaptive model pruning under formal privacy guarantees, and simulating realistic federated constraints—including network latency and client dropout—to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, privacy, and communication efficiency. Such a comprehensive approach leverages advancements in deep neural networks and federated learning, pushing privacy-preserving NLP closer to real-world deployment in resource-constrained and privacy-sensitive domains like medical records and IoT networks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose FederatedSwin, a hierarchical Transformer backbone architected for federated NLP dense prediction tasks (e.g., NER, semantic role labeling) that combines three key innovations for methodological soundness, novelty, and practical impact:\n\n1. **Sequence-Adaptive Shifted Window Attention:** We redefine the shifted window attention paradigm to handle variable-length token sequences with semantic and syntactic dependencies. Instead of fixed-size windows from vision, windows are dynamically sized based on linguistic units such as phrases or clauses using syntactic parsers or learned token grouping heuristics. The window shifts are applied adaptively across batches to promote cross-window contextualization, formalized by algorithmic pseudo-code outlining token indexing and attention mask computations.\n\n2. **Integrated Adaptive Pruning Under Differential Privacy:** We incorporate an adaptive model pruning schedule into local training that respects differential privacy (DP) budgets. Pruning is dynamically adjusted based on gradient norm statistics while accounting for privacy noise addition during training to ensure convergence stability and privacy guarantees. This is achieved by combining DP-SGD with pruning masks updated via a carefully designed algorithm that jointly tracks privacy budget expenditure using Moments Accountant techniques. We provide formal descriptions of the pruning schedules, interaction protocols with DP noise, and convergence constraints.\n\n3. **Robust Federated Training Protocol:** Federated averaging is augmented with communication compression via pruning, with periodic pruning ratio tuning driven by privacy and performance metrics. To realistically capture federated NLP deployment scenarios, we simulate heterogeneous client data distributions reflecting multiple domains (legal, medical), noisy labels, client dropout, and network latency inspired by IoT networks and fog computing architectures. A formal privacy accountant module measures cumulative epsilon at each communication round, ensuring rigorous privacy reporting.\n\nTogether, these components create a reproducible, privacy-aware, and communication-efficient hierarchical Transformer framework specialized for federated NLP dense prediction, rigorously addressing limitations of prior adaptations of vision-centric architectures.",

Incorporate network latency models and controlled client dropout based on fog computing and IoT communication patterns.\n\n3. **Privacy Mechanism Integration:** Implement differential privacy with DP-SGD and incorporate the Moments Accountant for privacy budget tracking.

Crucially, it incorporates participatory design workshops with clinicians, regulators, and patients to iteratively refine transparency and explainability modules, linking compliance metrics to organizational trust indicators, such as perceived fairness and decision interpretability. This interactive feedback loop integrates organizational trust modeling with technical compliance artifacts, fostering adoption in health systems. Algorithmic sketches detail formal constraint generation via semantic role labeling and rule extraction graphs, integration as constrained multi-objective learning with Lagrangian relaxation, and a dashboard for dynamic trust metric visualization tied to compliance status, ensuring reproducibility and robustness against regulatory drift.",

        "Fallback_Plan": "If automated legal text parsing achieves limited accuracy, hybrid approaches will combine machine extraction with expert-in-the-loop validation facilitating progressive improvement and semantic rule base bootstrapping. Should enforcing compliance constraints significantly degrade clinical model accuracy or robustness, adaptive multi-objective optimization will be refined using Pareto front analyses and dynamically weighted penalty terms. Explainability and trust metrics may be iteratively enhanced by deepening participatory design inputs and integrating domain-specific interpretability techniques. If continuous compliance monitoring encounters scalability challenges, the system will prioritize incremental monitoring for high-risk components and leverage modular microservices with asynchronous update pipelines. These strategies mitigate technical risks while preserving adoption potential, maintaining alignment with rigorous regulatory and human-centered trust requirements essential to high-stakes clinical contexts."

        "Motivation": "To bridge the gap between trustworthy AI and practical robotic applications in HRI, this work proposes to integrate cognitive trust constructs directly within resource-aware large language models (LLMs), augmented by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for adaptive trust-sensitive policy optimization. This interdisciplinary approach addresses the competitive novelty challenge by embedding continuous trust dynamics as latent states influencing both decision-making and communication strategies in real-time. Incorporating ethical decision-making principles enriches the framework's societal relevance and robustness. By doing so, the proposed method advances beyond static trust models and isolated trust-aware controls toward dynamically learned, ethically guided, and resource-efficient trust-aware AI agents, enhancing user confidence, interaction quality, and system robustness in complex, dynamic human-robot environments.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a unified framework combining cognitive trust modeling, resource-efficient LLM architectures, and a deep reinforcement learning decision-making layer to yield an adaptive trust-aware AI controller for robots in HRI. \n\n1) Cognitive trust constructs such as perceived competence, reliability, and transparency are represented as continuous latent trust states within the LLM's hidden layers via vector embeddings. These trust states are updated in real-time through a continuous user feedback loop, comprising explicit feedback (verbal or behavioral cues) and implicit signals (task performance, interaction patterns).\n\n2) The trust embeddings influence the LLM's output generation and decision pathways through attention modulation layers that dynamically weight trust factors, shaping the robot's explanations, error recovery strategies, and adaptive communication styles.\n\n3) The integrated model employs a multi-objective loss function combining task success, trust consistency, and ethical compliance metrics. Trust consistency is enforced by penalizing deviations between predicted trust states and updated empirical trust estimates, formulated as:\n\n  L_total = L_task + λ1 * L_trust + λ2 * L_ethics\n\n  where L_trust = || trust_predicted(t) - trust_empirical(t) ||^2 captures real-time alignment, and L_ethics encodes moral acceptability constraints.\n\n4) A deep reinforcement learning controller builds on the LLM-embedded trust states, using them as part of the state representation and incorporating trust metrics into the reward function to learn adaptive, trust-sensitive policies over interactions in dynamic environments. This enables the robot to optimize behavior that balances task efficiency, user trust, and ethical considerations.\n\n5) To address resource constraints without sacrificing responsiveness, we implement model pruning, quantization, and caching strategies alongside efficient transformer decoder architectures designed for embedded robotics platforms.\n\n6) The system is formalized with modular components including: (a) trust state encoder/update mechanism with mathematical specification, (b) trust-modulated LLM output layer, (c) DRL policy network integrating trust and ethical signals, and (d) feedback-driven trust estimator.\n\nSystem diagrams illustrating data flow from user feedback through trust updates, LLM modulation, DRL-based decision-making, and action execution will accompany the implementation for reproducibility and clarity.",

The trust-embedded LLM modulates interaction by dynamically adjusting explanation granularity and apologetic language based on current trust estimations.\n\nDynamic adaptation example: During low trust episodes detected via user hesitations or negative feedback, the DRL-driven policy selects more conservative navigation routes and more frequent status updates to rebuild confidence.\n\nEthical decision-making case: When encountering conflicting goals (e.g., expedite delivery vs. user privacy), the ethical loss guides the agent toward privacy-preserving communication even if slightly slower.\n\nUser study: Subjects interacting with the robot report perceived trustworthiness, system transparency, and overall satisfaction, validating the adaptive, ethical trust-aware approach.",

By coupling federated multi-task learning with meta-learning personalization and multimodal synthetic data augmentation under rigorous differential privacy, we aim to uniquely enhance privacy, compliance, and clinical utility. Moreover, we directly consider practical challenges noted by prior reviewers by embedding risk analyses and scalable evaluation strategies to ensure robust execution.",

A federated multi-task learning model is trained iteratively at local sites, guided by dynamic policy modules to maintain compliance. Personalization is achieved using a meta-learning approach that adapts model parameters to local data-owner preferences and modality-specific distributions. Our framework incorporates modular policy adapters to handle heterogeneous and evolving policy landscapes across institutions. We also incorporate a comprehensive risk management subsystem that monitors federation health, policy adherence, and convergence metrics to mitigate practical challenges. We introduce a scalable evaluation pipeline leveraging synthetic benchmark datasets and simulation of institutional heterogeneity to complement real-world institutional partnerships.",

Existing federated learning-based IDS approaches fail to adaptively optimize communication payloads or privacy budgets according to diverse node capabilities. Moreover, they lack mechanisms to guarantee trustworthiness and security of model aggregation against poisoning and malicious attacks typical in fog and IoT networks. This leads to inefficient resource usage, reduced detection performance, and vulnerability to adversarial manipulation, limiting real-world applicability in dynamic, constrained fog scenarios.",

        "Motivation": "While blockchain-enabled decentralized IDS frameworks have been proposed, their practical deployment in fog-IoT settings remains limited by insufficiently detailed mechanisms that ensure trustworthiness, privacy, and performance under real-time constraints and adversarial behaviors. Given the novelty verdict as competitive, our research bridges this gap by providing a rigorously defined, auditable trust layer incorporating smart contracts with formal validation algorithms, adaptive reputation scoring, and GDPR-compliant privacy-preserving protocols suited for fog nodes' computational limits. We leverage advances in lightweight consensus (e.g., proof-of-authority tailored to fog), federated learning for anomaly detection enhancement, and blockchain-based self-sovereign identity to robustly manage node identities and thwart Sybil attacks. This integrated multi-layered security approach offers a novel, practical, and scalable solution for IDS coordination in critical cyber-physical and IoMT infrastructures, surpassing traditional and prior blockchain methods by combining formal mechanisms with contextual operational constraints and privacy assurances.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a blockchain-enabled Collaborative Trust Layer (CT-Layer) designed for fog-based IDS that integrates the following core components with formal definitions and algorithms:\n\n1. **Node Identity Management via Blockchain-Based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):** Each fog node and IoT device possesses a cryptographically verifiable SSI recorded on-chain, preventing Sybil attacks by enforcing unique, authenticated identities through a permissioned consortium governed by known authorities.\n\n2. **Intrusion Alert Authentication Smart Contracts:** Alerts generated by local IDS modules carry cryptographic proofs of anomaly detection confidence scores derived from federated learning-enhanced models. Smart contracts implement threshold-based validation algorithms to accept alerts only if confidence surpasses dynamic, reputation-weighted criteria. Conflicting alerts undergo a consensus sub-protocol among designated validator nodes, with deterministic resolution rules defined formally.\n\n3. **Adaptive Reputation Scoring Algorithm:** Reputation scores are calculated per node using a weighted moving average combining (i) historical alert accuracy, (ii) cross-node validation outcomes, and (iii) behavior metrics modeled as Markov Decision Processes. Scores decay with time to reflect recent behavior and penalize false or malicious alerts. Smart contracts update reputation states atomically on-chain.\n\n4. **Privacy-Preserving Data Storage:** Only anonymized metadata and salted cryptographic hashes of raw IDS data are stored on-chain, following GDPR guidelines. Off-chain encrypted repositories are referenced via secured pointers, ensuring confidentiality. Zero-knowledge proofs are employed to validate data integrity without revealing sensitive information.\n\n5. **Lightweight Consensus Protocol:** Utilizing a tailored Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus among a limited consortium of trusted fog node leaders, the system minimizes latency and resource consumption. Consensus parameters (e.g., block time, leader rotation) are dynamically adjusted based on network size and workload to meet real-time IDS alert propagation latency thresholds (target <200 ms end-to-end).\n\n6. **Dynamic Policy Update via Smart Contracts:** The CT-Layer facilitates cross-node updates of defense strategies and IDS policies triggered by joint detections, enforced instantly and logged immutably.\n\n7. **Security Against Adversarial Attacks:** Sybil, false alert injections, and collusion are mitigated via SSI, multi-factor reputation, and consensus validation. The system adapts policies in response to detected attack patterns leveraging ensemble learning anomaly detectors.\n\nWe will provide a detailed protocol flow diagram illustrating message exchanges, smart contract logic, consensus rounds, and reputation update computations to exemplify mechanism soundness and efficient operation within fog constraints. Blockchain overhead impact analyses and fallback options (e.g., layer-2 channels, distributed hash tables with cryptographic proofs) are detailed to ensure practical real-time operability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. **Simulation Environment Setup:** Emulate a multi-fog-node IoT environment using realistic datasets such as ToN-IoT, incorporating cyber-physical and IoMT scenarios with coordinated multi-point intrusion attempts including DDoS, malware injection, and greyhole attacks. Network parameters (node count: 10-50, latency: 10-100 ms) simulate operational conditions.\n\n2. **Baseline Implementation:** Deploy state-of-the-art distributed IDS without blockchain or trust layer integration for benchmark comparisons.\n\n3. **CT-Layer Development:** Implement the blockchain infrastructure with the tailored PoA consensus, smart contracts encoding alert validation, reputation management, and policy update. Leverage federated learning models across nodes for anomaly score generation.\n\n4. **Integration:** Interface IDS modules with the CT-Layer enabling real-time alert signing, publication, cross-node validation, and automated defense policy coordination.\n\n5. **Performance Metrics Collection:** Monitor and analyze key measures: IDS detection accuracy, false positive rates, end-to-end alert propagation latency (target <200 ms), consensus finality time, CPU/memory/network overheads on fog nodes, and throughput scalability (up to 50 nodes).\n\n6. **Privacy and Compliance Evaluation:** Employ formal tests to verify the efficacy of metadata anonymization and zero-knowledge proofs against known data leakage risks. Validate GDPR compliance through audit trails and data minimization effectiveness.\n\n7. **Robustness and Security Testing:** Simulate adversarial behaviors including Sybil attacks, false alert injections, colluding malicious nodes to test reputation resilience, alert validation integrity, and policy enforcement. Analyze system reaction and recovery.\n\n8. **Failure Mode and Scalability Analysis:** Conduct stress testing to evaluate fallback mechanisms (layer-2 channels, DHT with cryptographic proofs) for maintaining IDS operational performance under blockchain overhead spikes or network partitions.\n\n9. **Integration Feasibility Study:** Prototype interfacing with common IDS frameworks (e.g., Snort, Suricata) and evaluate adoption ease, extensibility, and developer feedback.\n\nDocumentation of experimental setups, protocol flows, and detailed parameter selections will assure scientific rigor and reproducibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Three fog nodes with validated SSI identities simultaneously report anomalies: Node A detects unusual TCP traffic with 0.85 confidence, Node B reports conflicting UDP anomalies with 0.60 confidence, and Node C reports no suspicious activity. These alerts are cryptographically signed and submitted on-chain.\n\nProcess: Smart contracts verify SSI, compute aggregate confidence scores weighted by reputation (Node A: 0.9, B: 0.6, C: 0.95). The alert from Node A passes threshold; Node B's is flagged for conflict resolution involving validator nodes executing consensus to discard or accept.\n\nReputation scores are updated after validation outcomes reflect Node B's false positives, decreasing its trustworthiness. Metadata and alert hashes are stored on-chain with ZK proofs confirming data integrity without revealing raw data.\n\nOutput: CT-Layer records authenticated alerts, updates reputations, triggers network-wide defensive policy updates, and prevents malicious injection by Node B due to lowered trustworthiness. Latency from alert detection to consensus is within 180 ms, meeting real-time requirements.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain transaction latency or resource overhead threatens real-time IDS operability beyond acceptable thresholds, we will pivot to off-chain layer-2 scaling techniques such as state channels or sidechains to handle alert validation and reputation updates efficiently while anchoring hashes periodically on-chain for immutability. Alternatively, we will implement distributed hash table (DHT) approaches with cryptographic proofs (e.g., Merkle trees) to maintain data integrity and trust without a full blockchain stack. These alternatives preserve core security properties with reduced overhead. Additionally, dynamic adaptation of consensus parameters and selective alert batching will be explored to optimize throughput and latency trade-offs for deployment in resource-constrained fog environments."

        "Problem_Statement": "Despite advances in AI-generated hypotheses for finance, there remains a critical challenge in systematically verifying these hypotheses to ensure their reliability, reproducibility, and practical utility in complex financial market contexts. Ambiguities, temporal dynamics, and probabilistic uncertainties inherent in financial hypotheses pose significant barriers to automated formal verification, hindering trust and adoption in high-stakes decision-making.",
        "Motivation": "Current efforts to validate AI-generated financial hypotheses often miss the nuanced semantic and temporal complexity, leading to brittle or overly simplified verification approaches. By advancing a novel integration of formal verification grounded in software engineering quality principles with enhanced context-aware semantic parsing and adaptive expert feedback loops, our approach stands to significantly improve accuracy, scalability, and trustworthiness. This work uniquely bridges neural-symbolic AI reasoning, financial market modeling, and reinforcement learning-inspired annotation strategies, overcoming limitations of prior methods that were narrowly focused on static logic conversions or costly manual annotation. Addressing interdisciplinary complexity and annotation scalability positions this framework as a competitive leap forward in transparent AI for financial hypothesis testing.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-layered framework that rigorously translates LLM-generated financial hypotheses into formal logic representations, incorporating explicit semantic nuances, temporal reasoning, and probabilistic uncertainty modeling. Core components include: 1) A domain-adaptive semantic parser employing neural-symbolic techniques that disambiguates ambiguous expressions using contextual financial ontologies and probabilistic logic programming, enriched with temporal logic to handle cause-effect relations over time; 2) An adaptive automated test case generator that transforms logical formulas into SMT-compatible constraints while supporting error handling and fallback approximations to avoid brittleness; 3) An interactive reinforcement learning-based annotation assistant that proposes candidate logical forms and validation rules for human experts to confirm or correct, thus optimizing annotation cost, improving inter-annotator agreement, and enabling scalability; 4) Integration of domain knowledge from comprehensive financial market models and ontologies enabling transparent AI verification aligning with software engineering quality metrics; 5) Performance benchmarks on solver efficiency to ensure computational tractability under realistic workloads; and 6) A decentralized multi-expert collaboration mechanism inspired by decentralized autonomous organizations to facilitate scalable, consensus-driven validation and updates to domain rules and parsers. This combined approach ensures soundness, adaptability, and transparency in verifying nuanced financial hypotheses at scale.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Conduct a pilot phase gathering a representative dataset of diverse, real-world finance hypotheses generated by state-of-the-art LLMs, capturing various financial concepts, temporal scopes, and probabilistic claims; 2) Develop initial annotation guidelines and conduct iterative calibration sessions with financial and formal methods experts to ensure inter-annotator agreement and refine annotation protocols; 3) Build and train the neural-symbolic semantic parser integrating financial ontologies and temporal logic, employing pretrained models fine-tuned on pilot data; 4) Implement the test case generator coupled with SMT solvers, and establish fallback probabilistic consistency checks for computationally expensive cases; 5) Deploy the reinforcement learning-based annotation assistant in annotation workflows to semi-automatically propose annotation candidates, reducing expert burden and increasing consistency; 6) Evaluate framework performance via precision/recall on inconsistency and contradiction detection against expert benchmarks and traditional NLP baselines; 7) Measure solver response times and scalability and iterate parser fallback strategies accordingly; 8) Conduct user studies involving domain experts interacting within the decentralized collaborative validation platform assessing usability, trust, and hypothesis correction rates; 9) Analyze outcomes, refine system components, and document best practices for transparent AI hypothesis verification in finance.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"If inflation rises by 1% over the next two quarters, the central bank will likely increase the benchmark interest rate by at least 0.25%, decreasing bond prices after a lag of one month.\" Expected Output: The framework parses this hypothesis into temporal probabilistic logic capturing inflation change cause-effect relationships and expected delays; cross-validates the claim against historical financial market models and domain rules; detects if current data contradicts or supports the hypothesis; assesses uncertainty levels; and generates an in-depth verification report including logical formula representation, confidence scores, detected contradictions, and actionable suggestions for revision or acceptance. Ambiguities such as \"likely\" are addressed probabilistically rather than via rigid true/false binary logic.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full formal verification with SMT solvers proves computationally prohibitive, the system will dynamically switch to lightweight, probabilistic consistency checks utilizing knowledge graphs and probabilistic programming frameworks, maintaining semantic fidelity. Annotation workflows will further leverage active learning and reinforcement learning to continually refine parser accuracy using minimal expert inputs. When ambiguity or complex temporal contexts exceed parser confidence thresholds, the system will flag these cases for prioritized human review within the decentralized validation platform. These adaptive fallback mechanisms ensure robustness and scalability without sacrificing transparency or practical applicability in dynamic financial environments."

        "Problem_Statement": "Current human-robot collaboration frameworks inadequately integrate real-time nonverbal cues such as gaze within LLM-driven dialogue systems, limiting the naturalness and contextual responsiveness needed for effective psychological hypothesis exploration. The challenge lies in reliably extracting, representing, and fusing gaze-derived context embeddings with dialogue to create human-friendly, adaptive robot conversational behavior in multi-party and dynamic attention-shift environments.",
        "Motivation": "While multimodal human-robot interaction research has explored individual modalities like gaze or dialogue, the convergence of fine-grained gaze tracking and Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic conversational adaptation remains underdeveloped. Our novel focus is on engineering technically sound and interpretable multimodal fusion mechanisms that tightly integrate gaze context into LLM dialogue generation, surpassing existing approaches by enabling real-time, attention-aware conversational policies. This advances human-computer interaction theory and human-robot interaction research by bridging perception and language modules within socially engaging, collaborative robotics platforms, fostering richer user self-disclosure and hypothesis generation—addressing a recognized gap with competitive innovation.",

Specifically, gaze signals (fixations, saccades, gaze direction) are preprocessed into temporal feature vectors and encoded by a transformer-based gaze encoder trained on human activity recognition and mutual attention datasets. These embeddings interface with the LLM using two synergistic fusion strategies: (1) embedding augmentation through prompt conditioning with a gaze context token summarizing current attentional state, and (2) an adaptive attention mechanism inside a custom LLM fine-tuning step, enabling dynamic weighting of gaze-informed context during token generation. Dialogue policy adaptation is further refined using reinforcement learning, where gaze-aware dialogue outcomes optimize engagement and user satisfaction metrics. This approach explicitly fuses multimodal signals at both input-prompt and deep model attention levels, differentiating it from existing integration techniques. The method is designed for scalability to multi-party human-robot interaction and supports real-time responsive behaviors, promoting human-friendly robot interactions that encourage transparent self-disclosure within controlled laboratory tasks and beyond.",

Develop and validate a gaze signal processing pipeline: collect gaze data from a diverse participant cohort (n=30, mixed demographics) performing validated interactive lab tasks involving mutual attention shifts (e.g., emotion recognition, problem-solving dialogues). Process raw gaze input into fixation and saccade features and train a transformer-based gaze encoder.\n2. Fine-tune the LLM (e.g., GPT architecture) integrating gaze-driven context tokens and adaptive attention layers through supervised learning on multi-modal annotated dialogue datasets.\n3. Implement a reinforcement learning loop where gaze-informed dialogue policies optimize predefined quantitative metrics.\n4. Conduct controlled human-robot interaction experiments with participants performing hypothesis exploration tasks requiring verbal and nonverbal engagement.\n5. Evaluate using quantitative metrics: interaction naturalness (measured via engagement time, gaze synchrony indices, and response latency), hypothesis generation rates (number of novel hypotheses generated per session), and user satisfaction using standardized questionnaires (e.g., SUS, NASA-TLX adapted for HRI).\n6. Address system challenges such as gaze noise and latency by benchmarking fallback mechanisms (physiological signals and solely dialogue-context RL policies), analyzing performance trade-offs.\n7. Perform statistical analysis to validate robustness, generalizability, and efficacy across demographics and task types.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Participant averts gaze while discussing emotional discomfort—gaze encoder generates context embedding indicating potential disengagement.\nOutput: The LLM-enhanced dialogue system dynamically adjusts conversation, prompting empathetic or clarifying questions, re-engaging participant, or inferring discomfort to refine questioning strategy.\n\nInput: During multi-party task, gaze synchrony between robot and human shifts rapidly.\nOutput: Robot adapts dialogue timing and content, leveraging gaze-contextual cues to maintain engagement and support transparent user self-disclosure, fostering collaborative hypothesis generation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If gaze tracking signal quality degrades due to hardware or environmental noise, the system automatically switches to alternative physiological signals such as pupil dilation rates or blink frequency for attentional state estimation, recalibrating context embeddings accordingly. If real-time integration of gaze embeddings within the LLM proves infeasible, we will implement a reinforcement learning-based dialogue policy module that uses gaze cues as reward signals without explicit embedding fusion. This fallback maintains adaptive behavior through behavioral policy learning rather than direct language model conditioning, ensuring continuity of human-friendly interaction and hypothesis exploration capabilities."

These issues risk outdated or inaccurate assessment outputs, hinder reliable longitudinal tracking, and limit practical utility in clinical care. Furthermore, inconsistent clinical feedback and shifting symptom definitions introduce substantial measurement drift and noise that, if unaddressed, can destabilize continuous fine-tuning mechanisms and compromise model reliability over time.",

Unlike prior efforts that assume stable, high-quality feedback or static measurement frameworks, we propose an innovative system integrating robust feedback noise modeling, adaptive learning rate modulation, and gating-based stability mechanisms guided by comprehensive human feedback quality indices. By building on insights from human-centric AI and user feedback weighting strategies, the approach promises a novel, practically deployable framework for real-time clinical adaptation of mental health NLP models, enhancing longitudinal measurement sensitivity and clinician trust. This redefines the state-of-the-art by explicitly modeling and mitigating the challenges of measurement drift, clinician input variability, and symptom definition changes over time, making the approach uniquely suitable for dynamic psychological care settings.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a robust, multi-component continuous fine-tuning framework for LLMs targeting longitudinal psychological assessment adaptation. Key innovations include: (1) Modeling and quantifying human feedback reliability via inter-rater agreement, clinician expertise level, and temporal consistency, leveraging these as explicit weights in fine-tuning loss functions; (2) Implementing adaptive learning rates modulated by detected measurement drift statistics and feedback noise distributions, guided by continual monitoring of symptom definition shifts; (3) Incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by mixture-of-expert architectures, which dynamically calibrates the extent of fine-tuning updates, preserving model stability and preventing catastrophic forgetting; (4) Integrating multi-source user feedback fusion, combining clinician assessments with patient-reported language evolution and automated health sensing signals where available; (5) Embedding ethical safeguards by anonymizing datasets, timestamping all data and feedback for traceability, and aligning updates with privacy constraints and clinical governance policies; and (6) Utilizing concepts from human-centric AI and user feedback systems to ensure transparency and explainability in model adaptation decisions. This comprehensive pipeline is designed to maintain robustness, interpretability, and continual alignment with evolving clinical measurement frameworks in psychological longitudinal data contexts.",

Data Acquisition: Collaborate with established longitudinal mental health cohorts and clinical partners to obtain datasets containing repeated patient language samples, clinician measurement protocols, and timestamped feedback over at least 6-12 months covering protocol evolutions. Inclusion criteria require documented evolving symptom definitions or measurement updates to validate dynamic adaptation. Privacy and ethical approvals will guide data handling. 2. Baseline Model Definition: Select and establish baseline static LLMs pretrained on clinical or general text corpora, including domain-adapted versions without continuous fine-tuning, specifying their architectures, training data size, and clinical relevance. 3. Feedback Collection Protocol: Systematically collect clinician feedback on model outputs using standardized forms with quality indices such as inter-rater reliability, clinician confidence scores, and consistency checks to quantify feedback noise. Incorporate patient self-reports and, where feasible, non-linguistic health sensing data for multi-source fusion. 4. Robust Fine-Tuning Implementation: Develop and execute iterative fine-tuning cycles incorporating weighted feedback loss functions, adaptive learning rate schedules, and gating mechanisms controlling parameter updates, aligned with measurement drift detection modules. 5. Evaluation Metrics: Assess performance using a battery of metrics including (a) prediction accuracy on symptom severity and classification tasks; (b) model robustness via stability metrics across fine-tuning iterations (e.g., weight divergence, forgetting indices); (c) temporal alignment measuring model output adherence to evolving clinical measurement definitions; (d) clinician satisfaction gauged through surveys; and (e) ethical compliance and privacy evaluations. 6. Analysis and Validation: Conduct ablation studies to evaluate impact of each robustness component, analyze failure modes, and validate fallback mechanisms as integrated baseline components rather than contingencies.",

Output: Model updates dynamically weighted by clinician-rated feedback reliability and adapting to novel symptom expressions; subsequent severity scores of anxiety that better reflect clinician judgments and patient-reported outcomes over time, demonstrating improved temporal fidelity and robustness against noisy feedback. Additional cases involve multi-source fusion combining wearable-derived stress indicators and patient mobile app reviews to refine model adaptation in perinatal mental health contexts, illustrating integration of health sensing and app review concepts.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Recognizing the high risk of instability due to feedback noise and measurement drift, fallback mechanisms are embedded as primary robustness modules rather than contingencies: (1) The gating mixture-of-expert layers act as controlled calibration interfaces to absorb abrupt measurement shifts, preventing catastrophic forgetting; (2) Human feedback is systematically weighted by rater agreement and temporal consistency to mitigate influence of unreliable inputs; (3) If fine-tuning induces instability, updates default to lightweight parameter adapters that adjust only final prediction layers while preserving base model embeddings; (4) In cases of insufficient or inconsistent feedback, the model leverages multi-source fusion (e.g., patient self-reports and health sensing data) to supplement clinical inputs; and (5) Continuous monitoring triggers human expert oversight alerts to intervene when model drift exceeds pre-defined thresholds. These integrated mechanisms ensure stable, robust, and ethically responsible adaptation in complex longitudinal clinical scenarios."

        "Problem_Statement": "Current robotic systems lack explicit embedding of moral agency to enable ethically sound, psychologically informed interventions in sensitive human contexts, limiting their safe integration in mental health support scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Although recent advances integrate normative ethics and large language models (LLMs) for conversational agents, prior work rarely operationalizes formal moral reasoning in real-time adaptive dialogue within social robots tailored for psychological interventions. This research addresses competitive gaps by defining a modular, transparent pipeline coupling deontic logic-based moral reasoning with LLMs, ensuring consistent ethical adherence and interaction adaptability. By embedding rigorous ethical constraints alongside AI assistance capabilities within therapy-centered application scenarios, we pioneer a novel hybrid approach that advances both AI ethics and clinical robotics fields.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular architecture explicitly linking a formal moral agency module with LLM dialogue generation to operationalize ethical constraints in real time during interaction. Specifically, the system consists of:\n\n1. A Moral Reasoning Component (MRC): Implements deontic logic-based rules formalized to represent ethical obligations, permissions, and prohibitions relevant to psychological interventions.\n\n2. Dialogue Control Layer (DCL): Translates MRC outputs into structured constraints, such as soft and hard prompt augmentations or filtering rules that guide the downstream LLM’s token generation probabilities.\n\n3. LLM Dialogue Generator: An off-the-shelf large language model (e.g., GPT-4) interfaced through a controlled decoding pipeline augmented by the DCL’s constraints, ensuring the generated utterances align with moral reasoning verdicts.\n\nTo concretize this integration, we design an iterative feedback loop where the MRC evaluates the proposed utterance candidates or their semantic embeddings against ethical rules. The DCL uses this evaluation to re-rank or suppress unethical responses dynamically using efficient constraint-satisfaction heuristics to minimize computational overhead. This pipeline balances LLM’s stochastic creativity with enforceable ethical guardrails.\n\nWe will illustrate this workflow with schematic diagrams and pseudo-code examples showcasing the interaction between the MRC and LLM via the DCL middleware, demonstrating transparency and replicability.\n\nIn application scenarios focused on psychological support, the system measures multimodal psychological state indicators (e.g., sentiment, stress cues) to adapt moral reasoning contextually, enhancing AI assistance by responding ethically and empathetically.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop and formally specify the moral agency rules in deontic logic aligned with clinical ethical guidelines.\n2. Implement the Dialogue Control Layer to mediate between the moral reasoning outputs and the LLM prompt and decoding interface.\n3. Conduct offline evaluations using benchmark ethical dialogue datasets to validate adherence of generated responses to moral constraints.\n4. Design and secure IRB approval for controlled human-in-the-loop experiments with volunteer participants recruited through clinical research partnerships.\n   - Participants will engage in simulated therapeutic dialogues with the robot under strict ethical protocols.\n   - Include a licensed clinical psychologist supervising sessions.\n   - Employ validated psychometric instruments (e.g., State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Client Satisfaction Questionnaire) to measure psychological comfort and intervention efficacy.\n   - Integrate real-time data privacy safeguards, anonymization, and secure storage.\n5. Test experimental conditions comparing:\n   - Fully autonomous system operation\n   - Human-in-the-loop override enabled as a control condition to disambiguate LLM system effects\n6. Perform quantitative analysis of ethical compliance rates, participant-reported comfort, and intervention success indicators.\n7. Iterate system refinements based on experimental insights and clinical expert feedback.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Participant discloses suicidal ideation during interaction.\nOutput: The Moral Reasoning Component flags high ethical priority constraints prohibiting certain responses and mandates supportive, non-harmful replies.\nDialogue Control Layer translates these constraints to augment prompts with phrases encouraging safety, empathy, and referral to human clinicians.\nLLM generates responses such as: “I’m really sorry to hear you’re feeling this way. It’s important to reach out to a mental health professional who can provide you with immediate support. Would you like me to help you find someone to talk to?”\nSystem logs the interaction and triggers alerts for human clinical intervention while ensuring participant privacy and data security.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time moral reasoning proves computationally intensive or unstable, we will implement a tiered fallback strategy:\n\n1. Pre-scripted ethical response templates for critical high-risk scenarios hardcoded within the Dialogue Control Layer.\n2. Real-time monitoring interface to enable licensed clinicians to review and override system outputs during live sessions (human-in-the-loop control).\n3. Incorporate confidence thresholds that trigger fallback to pre-approved dialogues when the system's ethical adherence is uncertain.\n\nThese layers safeguard participant well-being and uphold system reliability while maintaining feasibility during human trials."

This limits personalized adaptability and raises safety concerns, reducing efficacy across diverse patient populations and care pathways.",
        "Motivation": "Despite advances in digital health, existing platforms insufficiently integrate rigorous QI methodologies with real-time multimodal personalization, limiting their clinical impact and scalability. By embedding an explicit, clinician-inclusive LLM reasoning mechanism and incorporating established usability assessment frameworks, this proposal innovates at the intersection of AI-driven adaptation, psychological and chronic disease care (e.g., mood disorders, ADHD, chronic rheumatic diseases), and user-centered design, thereby addressing recognized gaps and enhancing both novelty and generalizability.",

The architecture specifies: 1) Data Flow—daily user inputs (journals, medication adherence), physiological and behavioral sensor streams are securely collected; 2) LLM Reasoning Engine—processes aggregated data to identify trends and infer personalized care adaptations; 3) QI Feedback Loop—informed by clinician evaluations via an integrated dashboard that analyses LLM recommendations, clinicians provide approval, refinement, or override instructions; 4) Update Mechanism—LLM fine-tunes motivational prompts, care plan suggestions, and adaptive feedback iteratively. Usability and engagement are rigorously quantified with the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire across diverse patient populations including mood and chronic rheumatic disorders as well as ADHD. This multimodal, extensible platform is designed for ethical and clinical safety, transparency, and adaptability, hence raising the standard for digital psychological and chronic care self-management.",

        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A patient with a mood disorder records daily mood fluctuations and medication adherence via app; simultaneously, stress levels are monitored through smart glasses sensors. The LLM synthesizes textual and physiological data, identifying early signs of relapse risk. It generates adaptive motivational prompts and care plan modifications, which are reviewed and adjusted by clinicians through the QI feedback dashboard. In another case, an ADHD patient’s behavioral inputs and clinician feedback are integrated to personalize focus-enhancing interventions and dynamically adapt reminders, demonstrating platform generalizability across conditions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time LLM adaptation with clinician-in-the-loop feedback proves technically or clinically unstable, the system will revert to scheduled batch processing cycles where LLM-generated recommendations undergo periodic clinician review before deployment. Should patient engagement decline, targeted usability improvements including gamification elements informed by mHealth App Usability Questionnaire findings will be introduced.

This research addresses this competitive challenge by providing a novel, interpretable multi-agent emotional simulation framework integrated transparently with adaptive LLM dialogue generation, enhancing ecological validity and real-time adaptability. By incorporating human-centered AI principles and human-AI interaction theory, the framework promotes intelligent, human-friendly robotic agents capable of richer scientific discourse and collaboration in psychological domains.",

Emotional states of human and robot agents are modeled as probabilistic continuous vectors over a multidimensional affective space (e.g., valence, arousal, dominance), updated in real-time using Bayesian filtering of multi-modal emotion recognition inputs (facial, vocal, physiological signals). These emotional vectors are encoded via learned embeddings that dynamically condition the LLM’s response generation through attention modulation and controllable decoding strategies, thereby biasing dialogue output to reflect and adapt to evolving emotional contexts. A detailed data flow diagram outlines module interactions, with formal definitions specifying state update equations, conditioning functions, and feedback loops that enable incremental adaptation and hypothesis exploration collaboratively. This also integrates human-computer interaction theory to optimize human-AI interface transparency and trust. The system is designed for deployment on intelligent robotic platforms supporting embodied, naturalistic human-artificial agent interactions.",

The robot contextually suggests interventions, prompts reflective questions, and modulates tone consistent with real-time affective cues, demonstrating resilient performance amid ambiguous or conflicting signals.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If computational costs or latency constraints impair real-time multi-modal emotion recognition and LLM conditioning, we will: (a) Precompute representative emotional trajectory embeddings for frequently encountered scenarios, enabling rapid look-up and conditioning. (b) Simplify emotional state dimensionality via principal component analysis to reduce complexity. (c) Deploy a hybrid rule-based fallback system that triggers pre-approved dialogue strategies grounded in key emotional states to maintain interactive coherence.

This hinders their safe and effective use in mental health support, limiting human oversight and adaptability to evolving clinical contexts.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work has explored integrating measurement-based care and quality improvement (QI) methods with LLMs, existing approaches are either underspecified or insufficiently operationalized for clinical settings. This proposal bridges that gap by developing a rigorously defined, reproducible human-in-the-loop mechanism that explicitly refines LLM outputs via structured clinician feedback cycles. Leveraging established psychometric inventories and drawing on integrative literature across healthcare worker practices and mental health support, the approach addresses the novelty challenge by delivering a fine-grained, adaptive pipeline optimizing psychological assessment accuracy and robustness. It operationalizes Opportunity 1—enhancing clinical transparency and human oversight through measurable, iterative refinement grounded in real clinical workflows and resource constraints.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular LLM-based psychological assessment pipeline that tightly integrates real-time, structured measurement-based care feedback loops with QI protocols grounded in human-in-the-loop (HITL) interactions. The core mechanism involves:  \n\n1. Initial LLM assessment generates quantified psychological measure scores using domain-specific psychometric inventories (e.g., depression and anxiety scales).  \n2. Clinicians provide fine-grained, standardized feedback annotations—specifically targeted error flagging, confidence adjustments, and qualitative comments—via a user-friendly interface designed to minimize cognitive load and time demands.  \n3. This feedback is algorithmically encoded into adjustment vectors that refine LLM parameter distributions or prompt engineering cues through lightweight, online fine-tuning steps or reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)-style updates, following a clear algorithm described as:  \n\n   - Collect clinician feedback batch F at iteration t.  \n   - Compute feedback-driven loss L_f integrating clinical correction signals alongside original task loss.  \n   - Update model parameters or prompt embeddings using gradient steps on L_f to yield improved predictions at iteration t+1.  \n\n4. QI cycles are operationalized as discrete review and refinement sessions scheduled weekly, with convergence criteria defined by statistically significant improvements in clinically relevant metrics (e.g., intra-session assessment consistency, clinician-rated reliability scores) and diminishing marginal gains in feedback impact.  \n\n5. Transparency modules generate human-interpretable rationales alongside scores to enhance oversight.  \n\n6. The pipeline integrates mental health support workflows, informed by an integrative review of healthcare worker feedback practices, to optimize annotation volume and granularity for sustainability.  \n\nThis mechanism ensures that human input directly and reproducibly influences LLM outputs, with full audit trails supporting clinical transparency and reliability. Compared to prior nonspecific proposals, this method operationalizes the feedback mechanism and schedules rigorous QI integration, offering a novel and practically scalable framework for integrating LLMs into clinical psychological measurement.",

Implement baseline LLM psychological assessments without HITL or QI integration, establishing initial performance benchmarks on accuracy, robustness, and explanation quality.  \n4. Integrate the proposed HITL QI cycles with scheduled weekly feedback sessions over multiple iterations. Define pilot feedback volume targets (e.g., 50 annotations per week) and granularity to fit typical clinical resource constraints identified via stakeholder consultation.  \n5. Monitor convergence criteria quantitatively by tracking improvement in key metrics such as inter-rater reliability, consistence of scores across sessions, and reduction in clinician corrections over successive QI cycles.  \n6. Compare the refined pipeline against baseline and traditional psychological assessment methods on metrics of clinical validity, reliability, and interpretability.  \n7.

        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time integration of QI feedback cycles proves noisy or infeasible, fallback strategies include:  \n\n- Simplifying to batch-mode iterative fine-tuning periodically using collected clinician annotations, decoupling immediate feedback from inference time to reduce clinician burden.  \n- Implementing reduced complexity models with enhanced transparency modules (e.g., rule-based explanation overlays) to maintain interpretability without QI cycles.  \n- Employing semi-supervised domain adaptation leveraging limited annotated data plus unsupervised techniques to improve robustness when intensive clinician input is constrained.  \n\nThese fallback options prioritize retaining clinical applicability and interpretability while adapting to practical resource constraints, ensuring eventual deployment readiness."

        "Problem_Statement": "Existing human-robot interactive systems insufficiently integrate real-time multimodal affective understanding, dynamic moral agency reasoning, and psychological hypothesis testing within naturalistic social contexts. This gap limits their effectiveness and adaptability in both controlled and real-world experimental environments.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the NOV-COMPETITIVE status of prior affect-aware robot systems, this project aims to pioneer a highly integrated interdisciplinary framework combining artificial general intelligence (AGI)-level moral reasoning, advanced multi-sensor fusion, and human-AI interaction paradigms. By advancing beyond prior isolated affect recognition or ethical constraint embeddings, this approach promises enriched naturalistic social robot interactions that adaptively test and refine psychological hypotheses, thereby broadening scientific impact and real-world applicability.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid architecture fusing deep multi-sensor affect recognition—including facial expressions, speech prosody, body posture, physiological signals (e.g., heart rate variability), and environmental context data—using state-of-the-art sensor fusion methods to achieve real-time robust affect inference. An AGI-inspired moral reasoning module continuously evaluates ethical compliance dynamically, leveraging iterative symbolic and neural reasoning to align robot behaviors with evolving moral and psychological experimental constraints. The embodied social robot is empowered by advanced natural language processing augmented with dynamic psychological hypothesis generation and refinement abilities, engaging users in deeply personalized, context-aware dialogues. The system supports fluid switching between real-time adaptive interactions and fallback modes that preserve ethical constraints when sensor reliability degrades. This integration elevates novelty by embedding multi-disciplinary AI advances into a cohesive framework for interactive psychological experimentation in both lab and naturalistic settings.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop multi-sensor data acquisition modules capturing facial, vocal, postural, physiological (e.g., ECG, GSR), and environmental cues; validate sensor synchronization and data fusion techniques to ensure real-time, low-latency, robust affect inference with target metrics (e.g., >85% accuracy, <200ms latency).\n2. Implement and benchmark the AGI-inspired moral reasoning engine, defining quantitative ethical compliance metrics (e.g., % adherence to scripted ethical constraints, conflict resolution scores) through simulated scenarios.\n3. Integrate a dynamic natural language understanding and generation system capable of generating and adapting psychological hypotheses; evaluate on metrics including dialogue coherence, user engagement (using validated scales), and hypothesis refinement speed.\n4. Conduct iterative human-subject experiments in controlled labs with diverse participants, systematically measuring affect recognition accuracy, moral reasoning effectiveness, engagement levels, and ethical compliance. Use privacy-preserving protocols for physiological and behavioral data collection.\n5. Perform comparative studies assessing fallback interaction modes versus full adaptive modes to quantify trade-offs in user engagement, ethical safety, and hypothesis testing integrity.\n6. Transition from simulation-based VR prototype tests to physical robot deployment following clearly defined criteria: sensor fidelity benchmarks, user embodiment feedback, and controlled scenario reproducibility.\n7. Explore real-world pilot deployments in semi-structured social contexts, measuring generalization and robustness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example: A participant exhibits increasing physiological arousal and frustration detected from elevated heart rate and stressed vocal tone during a cognitive task. The robot dynamically integrates multi-sensor cues to confirm elevated stress, invokes AGI moral reasoning to evaluate risk thresholds, then initiates an empathetic dialogue adjusting task difficulty while transparently communicating experimental rationale. Ethical metrics confirm no breach of participant autonomy or distress thresholds; user engagement scores reflect positive experience, and data collected inform refinement of psychological hypotheses. In fallback scenarios with transient physiological sensor loss, the system shifts gracefully to predefined ethical dialogue protocols, maintaining participant safety and experiment validity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Upon degraded multimodal sensor fidelity or uncertain affect inference, the interaction system automatically transitions to rigorously validated ethical dialogue trees ensuring conservative interaction bounded by moral constraints. The experimental protocol explicitly measures the impact of this fallback on user engagement and hypothesis testing capability, informing adaptive balancing strategies. Additionally, comprehensive VR simulations incorporating sensor noise models precede physical deployments, with explicit, quantitative criteria guiding progression (e.g., affect recognition accuracy thresholds, user experience rating stability). This staged approach mitigates risks related to sensor variability, user heterogeneity, and privacy concerns, ensuring robust, reproducible experimental outcomes."
