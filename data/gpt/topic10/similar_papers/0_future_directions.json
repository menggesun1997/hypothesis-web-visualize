        "title": "Causal-DigitalTwin: Integrating Causal Inference with Digital Twins for Transparent Material Design",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current AI-driven material design pipelines lack robust interpretability and adaptive decision-making capacity due to missing theoretical frameworks linking foundation models with domain-specific digital twins.",
        "Motivation": "This project addresses the internal gap of lacking theoretical frameworks for integrating foundation models with digital twins, specifically by infusing causal inference methodologies from epidemiology, thus directly responding to the first internal gap and the first high-potential innovation opportunity.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel hybrid framework that merges causal graphical modeling with foundation LLMs embedded in domain-specific digital twins for material design. This involves replacing purely correlative machine learning modules with causal Bayesian networks that guide and constrain LLM output during data extraction and experimental design. The causal model dynamically updates with experimental feedback, promoting interpretability and ethical decision-making. The framework integrates interventions and counterfactual reasoning capabilities within the pipeline to explain design decisions and predict unseen experimental scenarios.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets from materials science experiments with causal labels and intervention records. 2. Train foundation LLMs fine-tuned on correlated material-property literature. 3. Construct causal Bayesian networks based on domain expert knowledge and data-driven causal discovery. 4. Integrate causal model with LLM predictions within a digital twin simulation loop for material design. 5. Compare pipeline performance and interpretability versus baseline black-box ML models and pure LLM pipelines using metrics like experimental success rate, interpretability scores, and decision fairness indices.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Material candidate A with initial properties X, Y. Pipeline produces: Predicted causal effect of property X on target catalysis performance; recommended robotic experiment sequence with justifications for each step. Expected Output: Explicit causal paths highlighting influential design variables; concise textual explanation from LLM; adaptive experiment plan that optimizes catalyst efficiency with human-readable reasoning.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full causal integration proves infeasible, fallback to partial causal regularization of LLM outputs with post-hoc feature attribution methods. Alternatively, employ simulated annealing to iteratively refine causal graphs based on experimental feedback. Debugging involves ablation studies decoupling LLM and causal components to isolate bottlenecks."

Alternatively, deploy minimal viable product targeting only sentiment-adapted response generation within existing LLM interfaces. Conduct user studies to identify key behavioral predictors for further refinement."
