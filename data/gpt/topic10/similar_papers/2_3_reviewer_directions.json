    "title": "Patient Engagementâ€“Enhanced LLM Augmentation for Balanced Mental Health Data Synthesis",
    "Problem_Statement": "The scarcity and imbalance of clinical data, especially for mental health diagnosis, limit the training of robust LLMs, leading to biased and less generalizable NLP models that fail to capture patient diversity and engagement patterns.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap about scarcity and imbalance of clinical mental health data and the external gap linking patient engagement with psychiatric research. The novelty lies in leveraging patient engagement signals from portals to guide generative data augmentation that better reflects real-world patient heterogeneity and temporal adherence patterns.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a conditional generative model powered by LLMs that synthesizes augmented clinical interview data informed by real-time patient engagement metrics (e.g., portal usage, questionnaire adherence). Align synthetic data generation with engagement-phased models to produce temporally realistic and demographically balanced datasets. Incorporate adversarial bias assessment to ensure augmentation reduces rather than exacerbates existing disparities.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multimodal datasets combining clinical interviews, patient portal logs, and demographic information.\n2. Train LLM-based conditional generators with engagement and demographic conditioning.\n3. Benchmark augmented data impact on downstream mental health classification models.\n4. Assess bias metrics pre- and post-augmentation.\n5. Run ablation studies removing engagement conditions to measure contribution.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sparse clinical interviews from underrepresented group with low portal engagement.\nOutput: Synthetic expansions mimicking realistic engagement scenarios, including varied symptom reporting and treatment adherence, validated against known clinical distributions.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If engagement signals are noisy or unavailable, use population-level surrogate engagement models or behavioral proxies. Alternatively, combine with federated learning to improve data diversity."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an ambitious conditional generative approach leveraging patient engagement signals to augment clinical mental health data. However, it lacks clarity on how engagement metrics will be precisely integrated into the LLM-based generative architecture. The mechanism for translating diverse, noisy engagement data (e.g., portal usage logs, questionnaire adherence) into conditioning variables for synthetic data generation requires elaboration. Further, the adversarial bias assessment approach is described at a high level without specifying how bias will be quantitatively measured or mitigated during augmentation. Providing a clearer algorithmic framework or preliminary model design would strengthen confidence in the method's soundness and reproducibility, especially given the complexities of temporally aligned and demographically balanced data synthesis in this domain. Consider detailing the conditioning model structure, feature engineering of engagement signals, and bias detection criteria explicitly in the proposal to improve mechanistic rigor and clarity. This will also facilitate peer understanding and replication feasibility as critical for an ACL/NeurIPS-level contribution. Targeting this gap is essential before progressing to experiments or impact claims."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the globally linked concepts ('adoption of artificial intelligence', 'electronic health records', and 'head and neck tumors'), a promising way to enhance impact and novelty is to explicitly incorporate electronic health records (EHR) data integration as part of the augmentation pipeline. For instance, extending the model to condition synthetic mental health data not only on portal engagement but also on multimodal, longitudinal EHR features (e.g., comorbidities, treatment history, lab results) could increase realism and clinical utility. Additionally, exploring applications beyond general mental health, such as subpopulations with head and neck tumors facing psychiatric comorbidities, might broaden clinical relevance and align with emerging AI adoption in oncology and integrated mental health care. This multidisciplinary expansion could elevate the work's translational impact, distinguish it from existing augmentation methods, and better position it for high-profile venues by addressing broader adoption and real-world healthcare integration challenges in AI-powered psychiatric research."
