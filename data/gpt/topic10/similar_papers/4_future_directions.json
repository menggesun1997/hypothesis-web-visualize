        "title": "Dynamic Protocol Harmonization via Transformer-Led Linguistic Ontologies",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current lack of standardized, interoperable reporting formats for experimental protocols limits cross-domain transferability and automated hypothesis testing in NLP workflows.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the internal gap in protocol standardization and the external gap in cross-disciplinary transfer inhibited by heterogeneity. By integrating linguistically guided protocol standardization with transformer architectures, we aim to automate protocol extraction and harmonization, thus enabling scalable interactive hypothesis testing.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose building a transformer-based linguistic ontology generator that ingests heterogeneous protocol documents across domains (e.g., biomedical, catalysis) and automatically extracts, maps, and harmonizes procedural elements into a standardized, machine-readable protocol schema. This involves multi-level token and semantic embedding layers trained on domain-specific corpora, combined with graph neural networks to capture relational dependencies between protocol components. The output is a universal protocol representation facilitating downstream LLM-driven hypothesis testing workflows.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect and annotate protocol documents from multiple domains (biomedical, catalysis). 2) Train the transformer ontology model on this multi-domain data. 3) Benchmark extraction accuracy against manually annotated protocols. 4) Integrate standardized protocols into an existing interactive hypothesis testing NLP pipeline (e.g., LLM-based). 5) Evaluate end-to-end system adaptability and cross-domain transfer effectiveness. Metrics include F1 for extraction, interoperability scores, and task accuracy on hypothesis tests.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Diverse experimental protocols in textual form from catalysis and biomedical studies. Output: A structured protocol graph specifying procedures, reagents, conditions, and outcomes, in a unified format. Example: From 'catalysis protocol: mix reagent A with B at 80°C for 3 hours' and 'biomedical protocol: incubate cells with antibody X for 2 hours', output standardized nodes and edges representing 'mixing step', 'temperature parameter', 'incubation step', durations, reagents, enabling consistent execution and query.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If transformer extraction accuracy is low, fallback to rule-based linguistic patterns combined with manual bootstrapping of ontologies. Alternatively, explore multi-task learning with auxiliary supervision signals (e.g., from domain experts) or fine-tune domain-specific language models to improve semantic disambiguation."

        "title": "Deep Active Learning Fusion with Visual Analytics for Adaptive Labeling Workflows",
        "Problem_Statement": "Human labeling is costly and inefficient due to lack of dynamic prioritization and interpretation of labeling function quality during iterative workflows.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses critical internal gap of underdeveloped links between labeling functions, quality assessment, and visual analytics, and external gap in integrating deep active learning to reduce labeling burdens while enhancing label quality.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design an interactive deep active learning system integrated with a multi-modal visual analytics dashboard. The system dynamically prioritizes data samples for labeling based on uncertainty, representativeness, and labeling function synergy scores. Visual analytics provide interpretable feedback on labeling function reliability and iteration improvements, enabling humans to refine labeling functions and select samples adaptively in an iterative loop.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather datasets requiring complex labeling (e.g., biomedical NLP). 2) Implement deep active learning methods (e.g., Bayesian uncertainty, embedding-based clustering). 3) Develop visual analytics dashboard to monitor labeling function performance and data coverage. 4) Conduct human-in-the-loop studies comparing adaptive workflow to baseline random or static selection. 5) Metrics: labeling cost efficiency, label accuracy, model performance gains per iteration.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A biomedical text corpus with unlabeled entities; initial labeling functions with uneven coverage. Output: Visualization showing labeling function overlaps, uncertainty heatmaps, sample prioritization queue. Human labels highest priority samples; system updates labeling functions and model; visual feedback guides next steps. Result: faster convergence to high-quality labels with fewer human interactions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If integration of visual analytics with active learning is complex, separate experiments can analyze effectiveness of each component independently. Alternatively, simulations using synthetic labeling noise can pre-evaluate prioritization heuristics before human studies."

        "title": "AI-Driven Clinical Decision Support Integration for Real-Time Interactive NLP Hypothesis Testing",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM-driven NLP interactive hypothesis testing systems lack real-time adaptivity and human-AI collaboration paradigms evident in clinical decision support systems, limiting interpretability and decision quality in complex domains.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the novel external gap concerning the absent synergy between AI-driven clinical decision support systems and human-in-the-loop LLM NLP research, enabling transformative real-time feedback for enhanced interactive hypothesis testing.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create a hybrid framework embedding clinical decision support system features—such as real-time alerting, uncertainty quantification, and human-centered explanations—into LLM-powered hypothesis testing workflows. This includes a feedback loop where user interactions and experimental outcomes dynamically tune the language model’s extraction and synthesis strategies, paired with interpretable visual analytic summaries to guide hypothesis refinement.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop integration middleware between an existing clinical decision support tool and an LLM-based NLP hypothesis environment. 2) Use domain-specific datasets (e.g., biomedical literature plus clinical trial protocols). 3) Simulate interactive hypothesis testing with users monitoring decision support indicators. 4) Measure improvements in hypothesis accuracy, adaptivity, user satisfaction, and decision interpretability. 5) Baselines include non-integrated LLM NLP pipelines and static hypothesis testing.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Biomedical hypothesis about drug interactions parsed from literature. The integrated system provides confidence scores, highlights possible conflicting evidence in real time, and suggests experimental steps. Output: Adaptive hypothesis refinement path with transparent reasoning and decision thresholds visible to users, facilitating collaborative exploration and validation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full integration is infeasible, prototype modular components separately—e.g., implement uncertainty estimation with explanations in LLM outputs—and conduct offline user studies before live integration. Alternatively, use surrogates to mimic clinical decision system functionalities."

        "Problem_Statement": "Limited interoperability and manual effort are needed to create high-quality labeling functions for diverse domains, obstructing scalable interactive hypothesis testing in NLP.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the external gap related to poor linkage between semi-supervised learning, pseudo-labeling, and LLM-based data programming, promising to reduce labor while improving label function quality across disciplines.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a system that leverages LLMs to automatically synthesize candidate labeling functions from minimal seed examples and textual descriptions of domain heuristics. These functions are refined using semi-supervised learning and pseudo-label propagation on unlabeled corpora. The process is augmented by human-in-the-loop feedback and incorporated visual analytics to iteratively enhance function precision and coverage.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets from multiple domains with varying labeling complexities. 2) Implement LLM prompt engineering methods for function synthesis from domain heuristics. 3) Design semi-supervised refinement algorithms using graph-based pseudo-label spreading. 4) Conduct user studies to validate labeling correctness and function usefulness. 5) Evaluate model training quality improvements over manually engineered functions.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A few seed examples labeled for biomedical entity recognition plus textual domain rules. Output: Synthesized labeling functions such as regex patterns or heuristic classifiers, improved through propagation. Result: final models trained on these labels achieve better precision/recall with reduced manual input.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If LLM-generated functions are too noisy, include confidence thresholding and function pruning phases. Alternatively, use transfer learning from related domains to bootstrap functions with stronger initial accuracy."

        "Problem_Statement": "Current workflows insufficiently capture and optimize the complex interdependencies among labeling functions, quality metrics, and visual analytics, hindering efficient cycle improvements.",
        "Motivation": "This directly addresses the internal gap of limited coherent linking between labeling functions, quality assessment, and interactive visualization to interpret and optimize iterative labeling workflows.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a multi-view graph representation modeling entities such as labeling functions, data samples, annotation errors, and quality scores, integrated into a visual analytics system. Implement graph analytics techniques—community detection, edge bundling, and temporal analysis—to identify bottlenecks and opportunities for optimizing iterative labeling. The system recommends labeling function updates and sample prioritization based on discovered structural patterns.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Create graph datasets from recorded labeling iterations on benchmark NLP datasets. 2) Develop graph construction pipeline to encode labeling conditions and quality metrics. 3) Integrate with visual analytics interface for user interaction and recommendation delivery. 4) Conduct user experiments comparing labeling efficiency with and without graph-guided suggestions. 5) Metrics: annotation time reduction, label accuracy, user cognitive load.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Data on labeling tasks with observed errors and function overlaps represented as nodes and edges. Output: Visualization highlighting clusters of problematic labeling functions and samples, with recommended actions. Result: users apply suggestions to improve labeling function definitions, reducing errors in subsequent cycles.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If graph complexity hinders interpretability, implement filtering and focus+context techniques to reduce visual clutter. Alternatively, simplify the graph model by focusing only on highest-impact labeling functions or samples with critical quality issues."
