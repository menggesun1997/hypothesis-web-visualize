        "title": "Federated Adaptive Compression for Resource-Aware IDS in Fog Networks",
        "Problem_Statement": "Intrusion detection systems (IDS) deployed in fog computing face a critical challenge: balancing detection accuracy with the severe resource constraints of fog nodes. Heavy models or communications overwhelm bandwidth and power budgets, while lightweight models lack precision. Current federated learning approaches do not optimize communication payload adaptively for heterogeneous fog devices, leading to inefficient resource utilization and reduced intrusion detection performance.",
        "Motivation": "This proposal directly attacks the internal gap of reconciling high detection accuracy with stringent resource limitations at fog nodes by integrating federated learning with adaptive model update compression tailored to fog resource constraints. Moreover, it leverages the hidden bridge between privacy-preserving learning and resource-aware IDS described in the landscape map to achieve efficient and private collaborative IDS training.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a federated adaptive compression framework (FedAC) where each fog node dynamically compresses its model updates using learned sparse quantization and pruning schemes based on node resource profiles (CPU, memory, bandwidth). The global aggregator integrates these compressed, privacy-preserving updates (combined with differential privacy noise injection) to build a robust IDS model efficiently. The method employs an autoencoder-based compression module that learns compression parameters during training to optimally trade off bandwidth/compute cost vs model fidelity. This architecture respects privacy via federated learning and differential privacy, with compression tailored per node to save resources without major detection accuracy loss.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Use publicly available IoT intrusion detection datasets (e.g., UNSW-NB15) with simulated fog-node heterogeneity. 2. Implement federated IDS training baseline with standard FedAvg and evaluate resource costs and accuracy. 3. Develop adaptive compression autoencoder modules at each node, integrating differential privacy noise per privacy budget constraints. 4. Compare proposed FedAC against baselines on detection accuracy, communication cost, computation time, and privacy leakage (via membership inference). 5. Conduct ablation on compression levels and node resource heterogeneity.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Local network traffic logs with labeled benign and malicious flows at a low-resource fog node (e.g., limited bandwidth and CPU). Output: Locally compressed model update with quantized weights and sparsity patterns sent to aggregator. Aggregator returns updated IDS model improving detection accuracy by >5% over baseline FedAvg without exceeding node resource budgets or compromising privacy guarantees.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive compression fails to reduce resource consumption adequately, fallback to fixed lightweight compression schemes or model pruning. If differential privacy noise degrades IDS accuracy excessively, adjust privacy budget or explore alternative privacy-preserving techniques such as secure aggregation or homomorphic encryption."

        "title": "Explainable Homomorphic Ensemble Models for Transparent Fog IDS",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current AI/ML-based IDS for fog architectures suffer from low interpretability, particularly when ensemble models or complex architectures are employed. Additionally, the integration of encryption techniques like homomorphic encryption to protect data during inference further obfuscates model transparency. This lack of interpretability undermines trust and hinders operational deployment in sensitive resource-constrained fog environments.",
        "Motivation": "This proposal answers the gap of insufficient transparency and interpretability in AI/ML IDS systems while also embracing edge-aware homomorphic encryption as highlighted in the high-potential innovation opportunities. We aim to build an inherently interpretable yet encrypted ensemble IDS that fosters trust without compromising security or efficiency.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We design a novel IDS framework combining inherently interpretable ensemble learners (e.g., rule-based boosted trees and decision sets) integrated within a homomorphic encryption inference pipeline. The ensemble is structured modularly to map decisions to understandable rules, while homomorphic encryption allows inference over encrypted data at fog nodes. To maintain interpretability post-encryption, a secure side-channel methodology is employed wherein encrypted intermediate decisions correspond to human-readable explanations via a pre-shared context. This fusion ensures transparent, encrypted, real-time IDS capable of deploying on fog nodes with constrained resources, maximizing user trust and security simultaneously.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Utilize fog-relevant IDS datasets with TCP/IP flow features and labeled attacks. 2. Implement base interpretability ensemble models without encryption as baseline. 3. Integrate state-of-the-art homomorphic encryption libraries for edge inferencing. 4. Develop the explanation extraction mechanism by correlating encrypted intermediate outputs with textual rule sets. 5. Benchmark detection accuracy, inference latency, and interpretability quality (via human expert evaluation and fidelity metrics). 6. Compare against opaque encrypted deep-learning-based IDS methods.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Encrypted network feature vectors captured by a fog node from an IoT device. Output: Encrypted intrusion prediction plus accessible human-readable explanation such as \"Alert: Suspicious SYN flood detected because of high connection requests (Rule 12 triggered)\" while preserving data confidentiality end-to-end.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If homomorphic encryption overhead proves prohibitive on fog hardware, explore lightweight secure multiparty computation as an alternative encryption method or reduce model complexity further while retaining interpretability. Also consider hybrid edge-cloud schemes where explanations are computed off-device under strict privacy policies."

        "title": "Blockchain-Enabled Collaborative Trust Layer for Fog-ID Frameworks",
        "Problem_Statement": "Intrusion detection systems in fog computing and IoT suffer from single points of failure and trust issues due to their centralized architectures. Sharing intrusion data among fog nodes is limited by security concerns and lack of trusted coordination, resulting in delayed or partial detection of sophisticated cyber-attacks.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the external novel gap in the research landscape: the unexplored potential of blockchain-enabled decentralized frameworks to provide data integrity, trusted anomaly sharing, and robust coordination among fog nodes, which helps operationalize IDS in a distributed resource-constrained setting with enhanced trustworthiness and fault tolerance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel blockchain-enabled collaborative trust layer (CT-Layer) integrated with fog-based IDS. CT-Layer acts as a decentralized ledger recording intrusion alerts, node behaviors, and reputation scores shared among fog nodes and IoT devices without centralized intermediaries. Smart contracts automatically verify alert authenticity, coordinate joint defense strategies, and enforce policy updates. The ledger design employs lightweight consensus mechanisms tailored for fog constraints (e.g., proof-of-authority). This integration ensures tamper-proof, auditable IDS data sharing, boosting coordination and overall network resilience without violating privacy constraints by storing only metadata and anonymized hashes on-chain.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Simulate multi-fog-node IoT environments with attack scenarios including coordinated multi-point intrusions. 2. Implement baseline distributed IDS without blockchain for comparison. 3. Develop blockchain infrastructure with fog-compatible consensus, smart contracts for IDS alert validation and reputation management. 4. Interface IDS modules with CT-Layer for real-time alert publication and cross-node trust evaluation. 5. Evaluate detection efficacy, latency, and network overhead. 6. Assess blockchain scalability and security under attack simulations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multiple fog nodes report suspicious activity hashes and metadata. Output: CT-Layer records and verifies these events on-chain, updates node reputation scores, triggers alarms if coordinated threats detected. This prevents malicious nodes from injecting fake alerts and empowers network-wide timely defense.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain transaction costs or latency prove too high for real-time IDS, explore off-chain solutions or layer-2 scaling (channels). Alternatively, replace blockchain with distributed hash tables combined with cryptographic proofs to assure data integrity and trust."
