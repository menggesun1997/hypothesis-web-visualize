  "prompt": "You are a world-class research strategist and data synthesizer. Your mission is to analyze a curated set of research papers and their underlying conceptual structure to produce a comprehensive 'Landscape Map' that reveals the current state, critical gaps, and novel opportunities in the field of **Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer via LLMs to Broaden NLP Application Horizons**.\n\n### Part A: Foundational Literature\nHere are the core similar research papers, which includes the paperId, title and abstract.\n```text\n[{'paper_id': 1, 'title': 'Foundation models and intelligent decision-making: Progress, challenges, and perspectives', 'abstract': \"Intelligent decision-making (IDM) is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to automate or augment decision processes. Modern IDM paradigms integrate advanced frameworks to enable intelligent agents to make effective and adaptive choices and decompose complex tasks into manageable steps, such as AI agents and high-level reinforcement learning. Recent advances in multimodal foundation-based approaches unify diverse input modalities-such as vision, language, and sensory data-into a cohesive decision-making process. Foundation models (FMs) have become pivotal in science and industry, transforming decision-making and research capabilities. Their large-scale, multimodal data-processing abilities foster adaptability and interdisciplinary breakthroughs across fields such as healthcare, life sciences, and education. This survey examines IDM's evolution, advanced paradigms with FMs and their transformative impact on decision-making across diverse scientific and industrial domains, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in building efficient, adaptive, and ethical decision systems.\"}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Generative AI and LLMs for Critical Infrastructure Protection: Evaluation Benchmarks, Agentic AI, Challenges, and Opportunities', 'abstract': 'Critical National Infrastructures (CNIs)-including energy grids, water systems, transportation networks, and communication frameworks-are essential to modern society yet face escalating cybersecurity threats. This review paper comprehensively analyzes AI-driven approaches for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP). We begin by examining the reliability of CNIs and introduce established benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) within cybersecurity contexts. Next, we explore core cybersecurity issues, focusing on trust, privacy, resilience, and securability in these vital systems. Building on this foundation, we assess the role of Generative AI and LLMs in enhancing CIP and present insights on applying Agentic AI for proactive defense mechanisms. Finally, we outline future directions to guide the integration of advanced AI methodologies into protecting critical infrastructures. Our paper provides a strategic roadmap for researchers and practitioners committed to fortifying national infrastructures against emerging cyber threats through this synthesis of current challenges, benchmarking strategies, and innovative AI applications.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Challenging social media threats using collective well-being-aware recommendation algorithms and an educational virtual companion', 'abstract': 'Social media have become an integral part of our lives, expanding our interlinking capabilities to new levels. There is plenty to be said about their positive effects. On the other hand, however, some serious negative implications of social media have been repeatedly highlighted in recent years, pointing at various threats to society and its more vulnerable members, such as teenagers, in particular, ranging from much-discussed problems such as digital addiction and polarization to manipulative influences of algorithms and further to more teenager-specific issues (e.g., body stereotyping). The impact of social media-both at an individual and societal level-is characterized by the complex interplay between the users\\' interactions and the intelligent components of the platform. Thus, users\\' understanding of social media mechanisms plays a determinant role. We thus propose a theoretical framework based on an adaptive \"<i>Social Media Virtual Companion</i>\" for educating and supporting an entire community, teenage students, to interact in social media environments in order to achieve desirable conditions, defined in terms of a community-specific and participatory designed measure of Collective Well-Being (CWB). This Companion combines automatic processing with expert intervention and guidance. The virtual Companion will be powered by a <i>Recommender System</i> (<i>CWB-RS</i>) that will optimize a <i>CWB</i> metric instead of engagement or platform profit, which currently largely drives recommender systems thereby disregarding any societal collateral effect. CWB-RS will optimize CWB both in the short term by balancing the level of social media threats the users are exposed to, and in the long term by adopting an <i>Intelligent Tutor System</i> role and enabling adaptive and personalized sequencing of playful learning activities. We put an emphasis on <i>experts</i> and <i>educators</i> in the <i>educationally managed social media community</i> of the Companion. They play five key roles: (a) use the Companion in classroom-based educational activities; (b) guide the definition of the CWB; (c) provide a hierarchical structure of learning strategies, objectives and activities that will support and contain the adaptive sequencing algorithms of the CWB-RS based on hierarchical reinforcement learning; (d) act as moderators of direct conflicts between the members of the community; and, finally, (e) monitor and address ethical and educational issues that are beyond the intelligent agent\\'s competence and control. This framework offers a possible approach to understanding how to design social media systems and embedded educational interventions that favor a more healthy and positive society. Preliminary results on the performance of the Companion\\'s components and studies of the educational and psychological underlying principles are presented.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "current_research_landscape": "The analyzed foundational works collectively underscore the significance of leveraging advanced AI, particularly foundation models and large language models (LLMs), to tackle pressing societal challenges within complex, human-centered domains like social media. The central issue revolves around the negative implications of social media, particularly its impact on community collective well-being and user interactions within social media environments. The local knowledge skeleton reinforces this focus, with core concepts centered on 'social media', its societal 'implications', and how these relate to 'collective well-being'. Dominant methods include foundation and multimodal models for intelligent decision-making and reinforcement learning to adaptively optimize social media recommender systems. Additionally, hybrid systems blending expert human intervention with AI-powered virtual companions are emphasized to support educational and ethical oversight.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps stem primarily from the narrow thematic concentration and limited bridging concepts within the cluster. There is a lack of integration or explicit connection between the social media well-being frameworks and advanced foundation model-driven cybersecurity or decision-making domains. The papers point to challenges in ethical governance, long-term adaptation, and personalization in AI-driven social systems but do not fully resolve these issues internally. Notably, the absence of bridge nodes signals that interdisciplinary connections necessary to enhance robustness, trust, and adaptive ethics are underexplored. Externally, the 'GPS' global context does not provide explicit hidden bridge nodes for this cluster, revealing a missed opportunity: incorporation of cross-domain concepts such as cybersecurity resilience frameworks, transparent decision-making paradigms from foundation models, or interactive agentic AI strategies from critical infrastructure protection. For instance, integrating concepts like AI-enabled trustworthiness, privacy-preserving mechanisms, or agentic AI for proactive intervention in social media environments remains unexplored but could address internal limitations like ethical oversight and system robustness.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate agentic AI methods from critical infrastructure protection research with social media virtual companions to enable proactive, real-time detection and mitigation of harmful content, enhancing collective well-being while preserving user autonomy.\n\nOpportunity 2: Apply privacy-preserving and trust-enhancing frameworks developed for cybersecurity in Critical National Infrastructures to social media recommender systems, addressing internal gaps related to user trust, data privacy, and ethical use of LLMs in socially sensitive contexts.\n\nOpportunity 3: Leverage multi-modal foundation models’ decision-making paradigms to enrich social media recommendation algorithms, moving beyond engagement optimization towards adaptive, context-aware promotion of community-specific well-being objectives, supported by expert oversight.\n\nEach opportunity strategically combines local domain problems around social media’s societal impact and educational challenges with global, underutilized concepts related to trust, resilience, and agentic autonomous AI from broader foundation model research areas, thus broadening the NLP application horizons via cross-domain knowledge transfer."
