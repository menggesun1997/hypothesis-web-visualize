    "title": "Cross-Domain Ethical Governance Framework for Adaptive AI in Social Media Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Ethical oversight in AI-driven social media systems is limited by narrow thematic scope and lack of dynamic governance models that adapt to long-term societal and user-specific changes.",
    "Motivation": "Filling the internal gap of ethical governance and long-term adaptation by synthesizing cross-domain approaches from resilient critical infrastructure management with social media AI ethics, creating robust, adaptive oversight mechanisms.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a meta-governance framework combining reinforcement learning-based adaptive policy modules with human-in-the-loop ethical committees. The system continuously monitors social media AI impacts, updates ethical rules dynamically, and integrates multi-stakeholder feedback loops through transparent dashboards and explainable AI to ensure alignment with evolving norms and values.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Map existing ethical policies across domains (social media, cybersecurity, infrastructure). 2. Build simulation environments replicating social media ecosystems with evolving user behaviors and values. 3. Train adaptive governance modules to respond to emerging ethical dilemmas. 4. Evaluate through longitudinal studies on system trustworthiness, ethical conflict resolution, and user satisfaction. 5. Compare to static governance models in preventing ethical breaches.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Emergence of new misinformation modality requires policy update. Expected Output: Adaptive governance autonomously revises intervention strategies approved by oversight committees, maintaining ethical balance and user freedom.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If autonomous adaptation risks unintended policies, incorporate stricter human approval stages and limit autonomy scope. Increase transparency and simulation fidelity for better prediction of policy impacts."
