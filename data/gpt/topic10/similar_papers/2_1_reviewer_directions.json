    "title": "Multidisciplinary Framework for Bias Evaluation Incorporating Psychiatric Nursing Insights",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current bias mitigation strategies in psychiatric AI research overly rely on algorithmic adjustments and narrative reviews but lack integration of frontline psychiatric nursing perspectives and quality of care methodologies, hindering ethical rigor and applicability across diverse populations.",
    "Motivation": "Directly targets the internal gap regarding scarcity of ethical and bias mitigation strategies beyond clinical application and the external gap across the bridge between patient engagement and psychiatric research emphasizing psychiatric nursing roles. This approach is novel by embedding human-centric quality of care insights within LLM-driven bias evaluation frameworks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a hybrid evaluation framework combining quantitative bias metrics derived from NLP models with qualitative data and ethical assessments collected through structured interviews and participatory design sessions with psychiatric nurses. Use this data to create an annotated corpus reflecting nursing concerns on bias and ethical issues. Develop a multi-objective optimization training regime for LLM models balancing predictive accuracy, fairness metrics, and nursing-informed ethical constraints.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Partner with psychiatric nursing departments to collect ethical and bias concern narratives.\n2. Annotate existing psychiatric clinical text datasets with nursing-identified bias markers.\n3. Train LLMs on combined corpora with multi-objective loss functions.\n4. Evaluate using both standard bias benchmarks and new nursing-informed ethical metrics.\n5. Perform comparative narrative reviews of bias detection pre- and post-framework implementation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical note describing a patient's symptoms with language often flagged as stigmatizing.\nOutput: Model flags and suggests rephrasing to remove bias; ethical report is generated reflecting nursing community perspectives on language sensitivity, improving clinician-patient communication.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If participatory data collection is slow or insufficient, fallback to literature-derived proxies for nursing ethical frameworks. Alternatively, implement a semi-supervised approach using simulated nursing annotations generated by expert systems."
