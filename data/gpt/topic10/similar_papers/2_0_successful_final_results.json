    "title": "Patient-Portal-Driven LLM Chatbots for Trustworthy Mental Health Support",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing AI chatbots in mental health lack deep integration with patient engagement platforms such as patient portals, resulting in diminished user trust, transparency, and acceptance, which limits their effective deployment in chronic disease management and psychiatric care.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical internal gaps of trust and transparency in hybrid chatbot integration and the external gap revealed by the hidden bridge linking patient engagement and electronic health records. This idea innovates by embedding AI-powered chatbots within patient portal environments, leveraging native functionalities to empower patients and foster trust.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an LLM-driven hybrid chatbot system integrated directly into patient portals, utilizing personalized access to EHR data via secure context-aware permissioning. Incorporate advanced explainability modules that dynamically generate transparent explanations for chatbot recommendations and responses using patient-specific metadata. The system also includes adaptive adherence support features that interactively nudge patients based on behavioral analytics derived from chatbot interactions and portal activity, combining generative data augmentation for training robustness.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets combining EHR patient portal logs and clinical interview transcripts.\n2. Fine-tune a GPT-based model incorporating attribute-based access control features.\n3. Benchmark with existing chatbot models lacking portal integration on metrics like user trust, interaction transparency, and engagement.\n4. Conduct controlled user studies with chronic disease and psychiatric patient cohorts.\n5. Use metrics including System Usability Scale (SUS), Trust in Automation, and adherence rates.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"I've been feeling anxious lately; can you help me understand what might be causing this?\" plus access to patient's recorded medication adherence and recent symptom reports.\nOutput: \"Based on your recent symptom tracking and medication adjustments logged in your portal, it appears that stress levels have increased recently, possibly due to medication side effects. Would you like suggestions on coping strategies or to schedule a consultation with your provider? Here's how this aligns with your treatment plan, with transparency reports.”",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If integration leads to privacy concerns or complexity, fallback to a modular chatbot that uses synthetic anonymized patient data augmented with general behavioral models for adherence support. Alternatively, focus on explainability modules separately to improve trust without full portal integration."

        "title": "Patient-Portal-Driven LLM Chatbots Integrating Social Determinants for Trustworthy and Equitable Mental Health Support",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing AI chatbots for mental health often lack deep integration with patient engagement platforms, such as patient portals, and fail to incorporate critical social determinants of health (SDoH) data. This limits user trust, transparency, and the chatbot’s ability to provide holistic, equitable, and personalized support in chronic disease management and psychiatric care, especially for underserved populations.",
        "Motivation": "While hybrid chatbot systems integrated into patient portals show promise, their novelty and impact remain limited without incorporating broader contextual factors such as SDoH data that influence mental health outcomes. Our approach innovates by embedding LLM-driven chatbots within patient portals, leveraging secure, context-aware EHR access combined with dynamic integration of SDoH and patient-centered care models. This fusion addresses internal gaps in trust and transparency and external gaps related to equity, health disparities, and social barriers affecting engagement and adherence. By operationalizing these data streams in a modular, privacy-compliant manner, we aim to significantly enhance utility, acceptance, and health outcomes in diverse patient cohorts, thereby advancing the state of digital mental health interventions.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a modular, LLM-driven hybrid chatbot that integrates natively into patient portals with secure, attribute-based access control to EHR clinical and behavioral data. Extend contextual reasoning to dynamically incorporate patient-specific SDoH factors—such as housing stability, employment status, and social support—sourced from linked databases or patient self-report modules. Employ advanced explainability engines that transparently communicate rationale behind chatbot recommendations, highlighting both clinical and social context. Implement adaptive behavioral nudging features informed by validated behavioral analytics models that quantify adherence and engagement, integrating multi-source longitudinal data from both portal activity and SDoH indicators. Design with scalability, privacy, and interoperability at the forefront, utilizing federated data governance frameworks and patient consent management tools to navigate ethical considerations and multi-institutional EHR diversity. Modular architecture allows iterative deployment and evaluation of SDoH and patient-centered care elements, promoting health equity and personalized intervention pathways.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Secure Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval encompassing use of EHR, patient portal logs, and SDoH data with strict data governance policies including patient consent management.\n2. Partner with health systems to collect anonymized, multi-institutional datasets combining EHR records, patient portal interaction logs, clinical interview transcripts, and standardized SDoH indices.\n3. Fine-tune a GPT-based LLM incorporating attribute-based access control, privacy-preserving mechanisms, and modular SDoH integration.\n4. Develop behavioral analytics models validated against clinically meaningful adherence and engagement metrics (e.g., medication adherence validated by pharmacy records, appointment attendance rates).\n5. Conduct multi-phase user studies with chronic disease and psychiatric cohorts, including underserved populations, measuring System Usability Scale (SUS), Trust in Automation scales, adherence rates, equity-focused outcomes, and qualitative patient/provider feedback.\n6. Evaluate real-world deployment challenges, including interoperability across diverse EHR systems, data privacy compliance, and patient consent workflows.\n7. Iteratively refine chatbot explainability and contextual reasoning modules based on user feedback and empirical outcomes, ensuring reproducibility and scalability within clinical workflows.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"I've been feeling anxious lately; can you help me understand what might be causing this?\" combined with access to patient's medication adherence records, recent symptom reports, and relevant SDoH data such as recent job loss and limited social support.\nOutput: \"Based on your recent symptom tracking, medication changes, and the social challenges you've shared—like job instability and reduced social interactions—it appears these factors might be contributing to your anxiety. I can offer coping strategies tailored to your situation or help you schedule a consultation with your provider. Here is how this advice aligns with your treatment plan and your current social circumstances, with full transparency reports.\"",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct integration presents insurmountable privacy or interoperability challenges, pivot to a modular system using synthetic, anonymized patient data combined with generalized behavioral and SDoH models to support adherence and engagement. Separately prioritize development of explainability modules to enhance user trust, potentially deploying them as standalone tools integrated into existing patient portals or as clinician decision support aids, thereby maintaining clinical utility and user confidence without full EHR integration."
