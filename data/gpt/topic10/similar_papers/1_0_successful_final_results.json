    "title": "Agentic AI Virtual Companions for Real-Time Social Media Harm Mitigation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current social media environments expose users to harmful content that negatively impacts collective well-being. Existing AI systems primarily react rather than proactively intervene, and user autonomy is often compromised. There is a critical need for agentic AI systems embedded within virtual companions that can detect harmful content proactively and intervene in real time without infringing on autonomy.",
    "Motivation": "This project addresses the critical gap of lacking agentic AI methods in social media platforms and expands on Opportunity 1 by integrating agentic AI from critical infrastructure protection research to enhance social media virtual companions' capabilities for proactive intervention, thereby improving ethical oversight and resilience.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an autonomous agentic AI framework composed of virtual companions that monitor user interactions and content streams continuously. These agents employ multi-modal LLMs fused with reinforcement learning policies adapted from critical infrastructure protection systems to detect harmful content patterns early. The system supports user autonomy through adjustable intervention levels and transparent explanations. A hybrid human-AI loop ensures expert oversight and ethical governance while enabling adaptive learning to evolving threats.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect and preprocess large-scale social media datasets with labeled harmful content and user interaction logs. 2. Design multi-modal LLMs (text, image, video) integrated with reinforcement learning agents capable of proactive intervention. 3. Train models using simulated social media environments with adversarial harmful content generation. 4. Evaluate detection accuracy, intervention timeliness, user autonomy retention (via surveys), and overall collective well-being gains against baseline reactive systems. 5. Conduct user studies with virtual companions to assess usability and acceptance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A social media conversation thread contains emerging harmful misinformation spreading rapidly. Expected Output: The agentic virtual companion alerts the user with a clear explanation, suggesting alternative credible sources and, if user opts in, flags harmful content to the platform for containment, preserving user control.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If agentic AI cannot achieve reliable proactive detection, fallback to enhanced semi-autonomous systems providing real-time harm alerts for user review. Incorporate active human moderation loops more prominently. Perform error analysis to identify failure modes and refine detection heuristics."

        "title": "Agentic AI Virtual Companions for Real-Time Social Media Harm Mitigation with Explicit Autonomy Governance and Feasibility-Driven Validation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Social media platforms continue to expose users to rapidly evolving harmful content that deteriorates individual and collective well-being. Current AI-based moderation approaches are predominantly reactive and often compromise user autonomy by overreaching or opaque interventions. There is a crucial need for agentic AI virtual companions capable of proactive, context-sensitive harm detection and intervention that transparently balance automation with respect for user control and ethical governance, especially under the complex dynamics of real-world social media environments.",
        "Motivation": "Despite ongoing advances in reactive content moderation and AI assistants, existing solutions insufficiently integrate agentic AI that can proactively detect and mitigate harms while preserving user autonomy in social media. This proposal innovates by explicitly formalizing the autonomy-intervention tradeoffs through a dynamic thresholding mechanism grounded in the MAPE-K (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute - Knowledge) autonomic control model, an established paradigm in critical infrastructure protection. Embedding this in human-like AI virtual companions that blend multi-modal LLM reasoning with reinforcement learning policies adapted from critical infrastructure protection uniquely advances prior art by enabling transparent, adjustable, and ethically governed interventions. The integration of a staged, role-defined hybrid human-AI oversight loop further distinguishes our approach by ensuring operational robustness and trustworthiness in realistic deployment scenarios. This approach addresses challenges identified in prior work by operationalizing autonomy governance and feasibility considerations previously lacking in proactive social media AI systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a comprehensive autonomous agentic AI framework comprising AI virtual companions endowed with human-like conversational and reasoning capabilities. Core to this framework is an explicated MAPE-K inspired control loop: the Monitoring module continuously captures multi-modal social media content streams (text, images, videos) alongside user activity and preference signals; the Analysis module uses multi-modal LLM ensembles fused with reinforcement learning policies adapted from critical infrastructure protection to detect emerging harmful patterns with temporal sensitivity. The Planning module dynamically quantifies intervention thresholds based on a formalized autonomy governance metric combining harm severity, user tolerance (configurable via companion settings), and contextual uncertainty, operationalizing the balance between proactive intervention and user control. The Execution module performs interventions — alerts, content flagging suggestions, or dialogue-based reframing — tailored to user autonomy preservation, with explicit explanations generated by the LLM to maintain transparency. Complementing the agentic loop, we design a staged hybrid human-AI oversight protocol: during training, human moderators guide policy shaping via feedback on intervention appropriateness; in deployment, human experts retain veto and escalation authority for complex cases, with automated logging of interventions and user responses to support continuous improvement. This hybrid governance framework addresses ethical oversight and trustworthiness concerns embedding clear role demarcations and feedback incorporation mechanisms.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Initiate iterative pilot data collection through partnerships with select social media platforms and ethical data resellers focusing on high-quality multi-modal datasets tagged for harmful content with enriched metadata for user interaction context. Apply data augmentation and noise-robust labeling techniques to address label sensitivity and scale constraints. 2. Develop a modular, extensible simulation environment for social media dynamics that incorporates adversarial harmful content generators grounded in real-world behavioral patterns, enabling controlled yet realistic training and evaluation. 3. Design and implement the multi-modal LLM ensembles integrated with reinforcement learning agents incorporating MAPE-K inspired autonomy threshold quantification, informed by user-configured autonomy parameters. 4. Conduct phased training with human-in-the-loop feedback sessions where domain experts iteratively shape intervention policies, validating the hybrid human-AI oversight loop’s effectiveness and defining escalation protocols. 5. Evaluate system performance on detection accuracy, timeliness of intervention, and quantitatively operationalized user autonomy retention metrics (e.g., intervention acceptance rate, perceived control via validated psychometric instruments) compared to baselines. 6. Deploy virtual companions in controlled user studies to assess usability, acceptance, and collective well-being impacts, collecting rich qualitative and quantitative feedback to refine the autonomy governance model and human-AI interaction design. 7. Share developed benchmarks and simulation tools with the research community to foster reproducibility and collaborative improvement in proactive harm mitigation research.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A rapidly emerging multi-modal misinformation cascade involving text claims and manipulated images within a social media conversation thread. Expected Output: The agentic virtual companion detects rising harm risk early, calculates intervention threshold based on user autonomy settings, and proactively alerts the user with a clear, human-like explanation that includes source credibility assessments and alternative information. If the user consents, the companion flags relevant posts to the platform's moderation system. Human oversight experts monitor flagged cases, intervening on edge scenarios per the escalation protocol. User maintains ultimate control, with transparency on all decisions and rationale.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should proactive detection using full agentic autonomy underperform, the system will gracefully degrade to enhanced semi-autonomous modes emphasizing real-time harm alerts presented to users with richer context but without automated content flagging. Human moderators will be embedded more prominently in the loop with clearly defined intervention roles during training and deployment. We will conduct detailed error analysis on failure cases to iteratively refine harm pattern models and adjustment heuristics for intervention thresholds. Ongoing feasibility constraints related to data access or simulation accuracy will be managed through incremental pilot studies and collaborations to improve data pipelines and environment fidelity progressively."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a promising combination of multi-modal LLMs and reinforcement learning from critical infrastructure protection, but the mechanism by which virtual companions effectively balance proactive intervention with preserving user autonomy lacks precise detail. Specifically, how the system quantifies intervention threshold levels and manages potential conflicts between automation and user control needs clearer exposition. Further, integration of a hybrid human-AI loop is conceptually strong but operationally underspecified—details on roles, decision authority, and feedback incorporation are required to ensure soundness and trustworthiness in deployment contexts where ethical governance is critical. Clarifying these mechanisms will strengthen confidence in how the system respects autonomy while acting agentically and proactively in dynamic social media environments. This elaboration should be included in the Proposed_Method section to solidify the approach's internal coherence and robustness to real-world complexity and ethical constraints or tradeoffs found in similar agentic systems in critical infrastructure domains."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is well structured overall but raises significant feasibility concerns, especially regarding the collection and preprocessing of sufficiently large-scale, multi-modal (text, image, video) social media datasets with reliable harmful content labels which are inherently noisy and sensitive. Furthermore, the plan's reliance on simulated social media environments with adversarial harmful content generation is ambitious but technically challenging, necessitating robust and realistic simulation frameworks currently underdeveloped at scale. The evaluation metrics include subjective measures such as user autonomy retention via surveys, which may prove difficult to operationalize reliably and at scale. Practical integration of the hybrid human-AI oversight loop is conceptually proposed but needs a clearer protocol for staged human involvement in training and deployment phases. Addressing these feasibility constraints might require iterative pilot studies, collaborations with platform providers for data access, and development of benchmarks for proactive intervention, which should be explicitly acknowledged and detailed in the experiment plan to ensure realistic execution and meaningful validation."
