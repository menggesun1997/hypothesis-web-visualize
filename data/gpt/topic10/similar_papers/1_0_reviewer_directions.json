    "title": "Agentic AI Virtual Companions for Real-Time Social Media Harm Mitigation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current social media environments expose users to harmful content that negatively impacts collective well-being. Existing AI systems primarily react rather than proactively intervene, and user autonomy is often compromised. There is a critical need for agentic AI systems embedded within virtual companions that can detect harmful content proactively and intervene in real time without infringing on autonomy.",
    "Motivation": "This project addresses the critical gap of lacking agentic AI methods in social media platforms and expands on Opportunity 1 by integrating agentic AI from critical infrastructure protection research to enhance social media virtual companions' capabilities for proactive intervention, thereby improving ethical oversight and resilience.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an autonomous agentic AI framework composed of virtual companions that monitor user interactions and content streams continuously. These agents employ multi-modal LLMs fused with reinforcement learning policies adapted from critical infrastructure protection systems to detect harmful content patterns early. The system supports user autonomy through adjustable intervention levels and transparent explanations. A hybrid human-AI loop ensures expert oversight and ethical governance while enabling adaptive learning to evolving threats.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect and preprocess large-scale social media datasets with labeled harmful content and user interaction logs. 2. Design multi-modal LLMs (text, image, video) integrated with reinforcement learning agents capable of proactive intervention. 3. Train models using simulated social media environments with adversarial harmful content generation. 4. Evaluate detection accuracy, intervention timeliness, user autonomy retention (via surveys), and overall collective well-being gains against baseline reactive systems. 5. Conduct user studies with virtual companions to assess usability and acceptance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A social media conversation thread contains emerging harmful misinformation spreading rapidly. Expected Output: The agentic virtual companion alerts the user with a clear explanation, suggesting alternative credible sources and, if user opts in, flags harmful content to the platform for containment, preserving user control.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If agentic AI cannot achieve reliable proactive detection, fallback to enhanced semi-autonomous systems providing real-time harm alerts for user review. Incorporate active human moderation loops more prominently. Perform error analysis to identify failure modes and refine detection heuristics."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a promising combination of multi-modal LLMs and reinforcement learning from critical infrastructure protection, but the mechanism by which virtual companions effectively balance proactive intervention with preserving user autonomy lacks precise detail. Specifically, how the system quantifies intervention threshold levels and manages potential conflicts between automation and user control needs clearer exposition. Further, integration of a hybrid human-AI loop is conceptually strong but operationally underspecifiedâ€”details on roles, decision authority, and feedback incorporation are required to ensure soundness and trustworthiness in deployment contexts where ethical governance is critical. Clarifying these mechanisms will strengthen confidence in how the system respects autonomy while acting agentically and proactively in dynamic social media environments. This elaboration should be included in the Proposed_Method section to solidify the approach's internal coherence and robustness to real-world complexity and ethical constraints or tradeoffs found in similar agentic systems in critical infrastructure domains."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is well structured overall but raises significant feasibility concerns, especially regarding the collection and preprocessing of sufficiently large-scale, multi-modal (text, image, video) social media datasets with reliable harmful content labels which are inherently noisy and sensitive. Furthermore, the plan's reliance on simulated social media environments with adversarial harmful content generation is ambitious but technically challenging, necessitating robust and realistic simulation frameworks currently underdeveloped at scale. The evaluation metrics include subjective measures such as user autonomy retention via surveys, which may prove difficult to operationalize reliably and at scale. Practical integration of the hybrid human-AI oversight loop is conceptually proposed but needs a clearer protocol for staged human involvement in training and deployment phases. Addressing these feasibility constraints might require iterative pilot studies, collaborations with platform providers for data access, and development of benchmarks for proactive intervention, which should be explicitly acknowledged and detailed in the experiment plan to ensure realistic execution and meaningful validation."
