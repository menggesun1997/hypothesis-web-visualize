    "abstract": "This survey explores the transformative impact of foundation models (FMs) in artificial intelligence, focusing on their integration with federated learning (FL) in biomedical research. Foundation models such as ChatGPT, LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and multimodal patient interactions. The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges, and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs and FL, laying the groundwork for healthcare innovations.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in enhancing psychiatric research efficiency. However, concerns related to bias, computational demands, data privacy, and the reliability of LLM-generated content pose challenges. GAP: Existing studies primarily focus on the clinical applications of LLMs, with limited exploration of their potentials in broader psychiatric research.\nOBJECTIVE: This study adopts a narrative review format to assess the utility of LLMs in psychiatric research, beyond clinical settings, focusing on their effectiveness in literature review, study design, subject selection, statistical modeling, and academic writing.\nIMPLICATION: This study provides a clearer understanding of how LLMs can be effectively integrated in the psychiatric research process, offering guidance on mitigating the associated risks and maximizing their potential benefits. While LLMs hold promise for advancing psychiatric research, careful oversight, rigorous validation, and adherence to ethical standards are crucial to mitigating risks such as bias, data privacy concerns, and reliability issues, thereby ensuring their effective and responsible use in improving psychiatric research.",

    "year": 2023,
    "citationCount": 153,
    "fieldCitationRatio": 0.0,
    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, are promising for revolutionizing data and information management in healthcare and medicine. However, there is scant literature guiding their integration for non-AI professionals. This study conducts a scoping literature review to address the critical need for guidance on integrating generative AI and LLMs into healthcare and medical practices. It elucidates the distinct mechanisms underpinning these technologies, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLFH), including few-shot learning and chain-of-thought reasoning, which differentiates them from traditional, rule-based AI systems. It requires an inclusive, collaborative co-design process that engages all pertinent stakeholders, including clinicians and consumers, to achieve these benefits. Although global research is examining both opportunities and challenges, including ethical and legal dimensions, LLMs offer promising advancements in healthcare by enhancing data management, information retrieval, and decision-making processes. Continued innovation in data acquisition, model fine-tuning, prompt strategy development, evaluation, and system implementation is imperative for realizing the full potential of these technologies. Organizations should proactively engage with these technologies to improve healthcare quality, safety, and efficiency, adhering to ethical and legal guidelines for responsible application.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, particularly through hybrid chatbots, is reshaping the industry by enhancing service delivery, patient engagement, and clinical outcomes. These chatbots combine AI with human input to provide intelligent, personalized interactions in areas like diagnostics, chronic disease management, and mental health support. However, gaps remain in trust, data security, system integration, and user experience, which hinder widespread adoption. Key challenges include the hesitancy of patients to trust AI due to concerns over data privacy and the accuracy of medical advice, as well as difficulties in integrating chatbots into existing healthcare infrastructures. The review aims to assess the effectiveness of hybrid AI chatbots in improving healthcare outcomes, reducing costs, and enhancing patient engagement, while identifying barriers to adoption such as cultural adaptability and trust issues. The novelty of the review lies in its comprehensive exploration of both technological advancements and the socio-emotional factors influencing chatbot acceptance.\nMethods: The review follows a systematic methodology with four core components: eligibility criteria, review selection, data extraction, and data synthesis. Studies focused on AI applications and hybrid chatbots in healthcare, particularly in chronic disease management and mental health support, were included. Publications from 2022 to 2025 were prioritized, and peer-reviewed sources in English were considered. After screening 116 studies, 29 met the criteria for inclusion. Data was extracted using a structured template, capturing study objectives, methodologies, findings, and challenges. Thematic analysis was applied to identify four themes: AI applications, technical advancements, user adoption, and challenges/ethical concerns. Statistical and content analysis methods were employed to synthesize the data comprehensively, ensuring robustness in the findings.\nResults: Hybrid chatbots in healthcare have shown significant benefits, such as reducing hospital readmissions by up to 25%, improving patient engagement by 30%, and cutting consultation wait times by 15%. They are widely used for chronic disease management, mental health support, and patient education, demonstrating their efficiency in both developed and developing countries.\nDiscussion: The review concludes that overcoming these barriers through infrastructure investment, training, and enhanced transparency is crucial for maximizing the potential of AI in healthcare. Future researchers should focus on long-term outcomes, addressing ethical considerations, and expanding cross-cultural adaptability. Limitations of the review include the narrow scope of some case studies and the absence of long-term data on AI's efficacy in diverse healthcare contexts. Further studies are needed to explore these challenges and the long-term impact of AI-driven healthcare solutions.",

    "abstract": "As digital healthcare evolves, the security of electronic health records (EHR) becomes increasingly crucial. This study presents the GPT-Onto-CAABAC framework, integrating Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT), medical-legal ontologies and Context-Aware Attribute-Based Access Control (CAABAC) to enhance EHR access security. Unlike traditional models, GPT-Onto-CAABAC dynamically interprets policies and adapts to changing healthcare and legal environments, offering customized access control solutions. Through empirical evaluation, this framework is shown to be effective in improving EHR security by accurately aligning access decisions with complex regulatory and situational requirements. The findings suggest its broader applicability in sectors where access control must meet stringent compliance and adaptability standards.",

    "abstract": "The global prevalence of mental health disorders is increasing, leading to a significant economic burden estimated in trillions of dollars. In automated mental health diagnosis, the scarcity and imbalance of clinical data pose considerable challenges for researchers, limiting the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms. To cope with this issue, this paper aims to introduce a novel clinical transcript data augmentation framework by leveraging large language models (CALLM). The framework follows a \"patient-doctor role-playing\" intuition to generate realistic synthetic data. In addition, our study introduces a unique \"Textbook-Assignment-Application\" (T-A-A) partitioning approach to offer a systematic means of crafting synthetic clinical interview datasets. Concurrently, we have also developed a \"Response-Reason\" prompt engineering paradigm to generate highly authentic and diagnostically valuable transcripts. By leveraging a fine-tuned DistilBERT model on the E-DAIC PTSD dataset, we achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.77, an F1-score of 0.70, and an AUC of 0.78 during test set evaluations, which showcase robust adaptability in both Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and Few-Shot Learning (FSL) scenarios. We further compare the CALLM framework with other data augmentation methods and PTSD diagnostic works and demonstrates consistent improvements. Compared to conventional data collection methods, our synthetic dataset not only demonstrates superior performance but also incurs less than 1% of the associated costs.",
