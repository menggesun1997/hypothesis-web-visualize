        "title": "Patient-Portal-Driven LLM Chatbots for Trustworthy Mental Health Support",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing AI chatbots in mental health lack deep integration with patient engagement platforms such as patient portals, resulting in diminished user trust, transparency, and acceptance, which limits their effective deployment in chronic disease management and psychiatric care.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the critical internal gaps of trust and transparency in hybrid chatbot integration and the external gap revealed by the hidden bridge linking patient engagement and electronic health records. This idea innovates by embedding AI-powered chatbots within patient portal environments, leveraging native functionalities to empower patients and foster trust.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an LLM-driven hybrid chatbot system integrated directly into patient portals, utilizing personalized access to EHR data via secure context-aware permissioning. Incorporate advanced explainability modules that dynamically generate transparent explanations for chatbot recommendations and responses using patient-specific metadata. The system also includes adaptive adherence support features that interactively nudge patients based on behavioral analytics derived from chatbot interactions and portal activity, combining generative data augmentation for training robustness.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets combining EHR patient portal logs and clinical interview transcripts.\n2. Fine-tune a GPT-based model incorporating attribute-based access control features.\n3. Benchmark with existing chatbot models lacking portal integration on metrics like user trust, interaction transparency, and engagement.\n4. Conduct controlled user studies with chronic disease and psychiatric patient cohorts.\n5. Use metrics including System Usability Scale (SUS), Trust in Automation, and adherence rates.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"I've been feeling anxious lately; can you help me understand what might be causing this?\" plus access to patient's recorded medication adherence and recent symptom reports.\nOutput: \"Based on your recent symptom tracking and medication adjustments logged in your portal, it appears that stress levels have increased recently, possibly due to medication side effects. Would you like suggestions on coping strategies or to schedule a consultation with your provider? Here's how this aligns with your treatment plan, with transparency reports.”",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If integration leads to privacy concerns or complexity, fallback to a modular chatbot that uses synthetic anonymized patient data augmented with general behavioral models for adherence support. Alternatively, focus on explainability modules separately to improve trust without full portal integration."

        "title": "Multidisciplinary Framework for Bias Evaluation Incorporating Psychiatric Nursing Insights",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current bias mitigation strategies in psychiatric AI research overly rely on algorithmic adjustments and narrative reviews but lack integration of frontline psychiatric nursing perspectives and quality of care methodologies, hindering ethical rigor and applicability across diverse populations.",
        "Motivation": "Directly targets the internal gap regarding scarcity of ethical and bias mitigation strategies beyond clinical application and the external gap across the bridge between patient engagement and psychiatric research emphasizing psychiatric nursing roles. This approach is novel by embedding human-centric quality of care insights within LLM-driven bias evaluation frameworks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a hybrid evaluation framework combining quantitative bias metrics derived from NLP models with qualitative data and ethical assessments collected through structured interviews and participatory design sessions with psychiatric nurses. Use this data to create an annotated corpus reflecting nursing concerns on bias and ethical issues. Develop a multi-objective optimization training regime for LLM models balancing predictive accuracy, fairness metrics, and nursing-informed ethical constraints.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Partner with psychiatric nursing departments to collect ethical and bias concern narratives.\n2. Annotate existing psychiatric clinical text datasets with nursing-identified bias markers.\n3. Train LLMs on combined corpora with multi-objective loss functions.\n4. Evaluate using both standard bias benchmarks and new nursing-informed ethical metrics.\n5. Perform comparative narrative reviews of bias detection pre- and post-framework implementation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical note describing a patient's symptoms with language often flagged as stigmatizing.\nOutput: Model flags and suggests rephrasing to remove bias; ethical report is generated reflecting nursing community perspectives on language sensitivity, improving clinician-patient communication.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If participatory data collection is slow or insufficient, fallback to literature-derived proxies for nursing ethical frameworks. Alternatively, implement a semi-supervised approach using simulated nursing annotations generated by expert systems."

        "title": "GPT-Onto-CAABAC: Adaptive Context-Aware Access Control Leveraging LLM Ontologies in Mental Healthcare",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing attribute-based access control frameworks for electronic health records lack dynamic, context-aware adaptability informed by psychiatric research insights and fail to integrate LLM-driven ontology management, limiting ethical compliance and bias mitigation in mental health applications.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap identifying immature integrative frameworks linking ethical access control and AI application themes via the generative pretrained transformer bridge. Also leverages external hidden bridges connecting psychiatric research and EHR with person-centered mental healthcare needs. This project proposes unifying ontology-enhanced LLM access models for adaptive, ethical data governance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design and implement GPT-Onto-CAABAC, a novel AI-driven access control model that dynamically infers patient context (clinical status, psychiatric screening outcomes) using LLM-based ontologies. Integrate multi-modal EHR data and psychiatric nursing inputs to form semantic ontologies that guide fine-grained access decisions. The system will learn from audit logs to adapt policies respecting patient privacy preferences while maintaining care quality, with bias mitigation modules controlling for discriminatory access patterns.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop psychiatric and EHR ontologies using expert-curated datasets.\n2. Implement LLM modules that generate access control decisions based on ontology reasoning.\n3. Deploy in simulated EHR environment with synthetic patient profiles reflecting diverse mental health states.\n4. Evaluate policy adaptability, bias reduction (disparate impact measures), and care effectiveness.\n5. Test with real-world longitudinal data where feasible, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Request by a clinician to access mental health screening data for a patient flagged as high risk.\nOutput: Access granted with conditions limiting downstream data sharing, accompanied by an audit trail and real-time bias assessment ensuring no unnecessary exposure to non-essential staff.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If ontology complexity hinders real-time performance, fallback on rule-based hybrid models with precompiled LLM policy suggestions. Alternatively, reduce context features to core elements and progressively reintroduce complexity."

        "title": "Patient Engagement–Enhanced LLM Augmentation for Balanced Mental Health Data Synthesis",
        "Problem_Statement": "The scarcity and imbalance of clinical data, especially for mental health diagnosis, limit the training of robust LLMs, leading to biased and less generalizable NLP models that fail to capture patient diversity and engagement patterns.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap about scarcity and imbalance of clinical mental health data and the external gap linking patient engagement with psychiatric research. The novelty lies in leveraging patient engagement signals from portals to guide generative data augmentation that better reflects real-world patient heterogeneity and temporal adherence patterns.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a conditional generative model powered by LLMs that synthesizes augmented clinical interview data informed by real-time patient engagement metrics (e.g., portal usage, questionnaire adherence). Align synthetic data generation with engagement-phased models to produce temporally realistic and demographically balanced datasets. Incorporate adversarial bias assessment to ensure augmentation reduces rather than exacerbates existing disparities.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multimodal datasets combining clinical interviews, patient portal logs, and demographic information.\n2. Train LLM-based conditional generators with engagement and demographic conditioning.\n3. Benchmark augmented data impact on downstream mental health classification models.\n4. Assess bias metrics pre- and post-augmentation.\n5. Run ablation studies removing engagement conditions to measure contribution.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sparse clinical interviews from underrepresented group with low portal engagement.\nOutput: Synthetic expansions mimicking realistic engagement scenarios, including varied symptom reporting and treatment adherence, validated against known clinical distributions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If engagement signals are noisy or unavailable, use population-level surrogate engagement models or behavioral proxies. Alternatively, combine with federated learning to improve data diversity."

        "title": "Cross-Disciplinary LLM-Powered Adherence Support System Integrating Psychiatric Nursing and EHR Interfaces",
        "Problem_Statement": "Lack of integrated adherence support systems combining psychiatric nursing best practices with electronic health record functionalities limits effective patient engagement and treatment adherence in mental health care.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the external hidden bridge gap between patient engagement, psychiatric nursing, and EHR by synthesizing these domains into AI-driven adherence interventions embedded within clinical workflows. The novel contribution is a human-centric, AI-augmented adherence support platform contextualized by psychiatric nursing insights.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an AI platform combining LLMs trained on psychiatric nursing literature, clinical care pathways, and EHR metadata to provide personalized adherence recommendations and reminders. The system leverages patient portal interactions, nurse-generated annotations, and real-time clinical notes to dynamically adapt support messages. It includes feedback loops for nurses to review AI interventions and adjust guidance, enabling continuous improvement and ethical oversight.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Aggregate psychiatric nursing guidelines, EHR data, and patient portal logs.\n2. Train LLMs for adherence recommendation generation.\n3. Implement interfaces for nursing review and feedback.\n4. Conduct pilot studies in psychiatric clinics measuring adherence improvement and acceptability.\n5. Evaluate using adherence rates, user satisfaction, and bias audits.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient with a history of sporadic medication adherence and notes from nurses indicating barriers.\nOutput: Tailored reminder schedules, motivational messages, and scheduling of nurse follow-ups via portal integration, all compliant with ethical standards and culturally sensitive.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If nurse feedback is limited, incorporate passive monitoring from portal usage data. If real-time adaptation is hard, deploy static protocol-based adherence support modules."
