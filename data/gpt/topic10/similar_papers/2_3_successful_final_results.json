    "title": "Patient Engagementâ€“Enhanced LLM Augmentation for Balanced Mental Health Data Synthesis",
    "Problem_Statement": "The scarcity and imbalance of clinical data, especially for mental health diagnosis, limit the training of robust LLMs, leading to biased and less generalizable NLP models that fail to capture patient diversity and engagement patterns.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap about scarcity and imbalance of clinical mental health data and the external gap linking patient engagement with psychiatric research. The novelty lies in leveraging patient engagement signals from portals to guide generative data augmentation that better reflects real-world patient heterogeneity and temporal adherence patterns.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a conditional generative model powered by LLMs that synthesizes augmented clinical interview data informed by real-time patient engagement metrics (e.g., portal usage, questionnaire adherence). Align synthetic data generation with engagement-phased models to produce temporally realistic and demographically balanced datasets. Incorporate adversarial bias assessment to ensure augmentation reduces rather than exacerbates existing disparities.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multimodal datasets combining clinical interviews, patient portal logs, and demographic information.\n2. Train LLM-based conditional generators with engagement and demographic conditioning.\n3. Benchmark augmented data impact on downstream mental health classification models.\n4. Assess bias metrics pre- and post-augmentation.\n5. Run ablation studies removing engagement conditions to measure contribution.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sparse clinical interviews from underrepresented group with low portal engagement.\nOutput: Synthetic expansions mimicking realistic engagement scenarios, including varied symptom reporting and treatment adherence, validated against known clinical distributions.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If engagement signals are noisy or unavailable, use population-level surrogate engagement models or behavioral proxies. Alternatively, combine with federated learning to improve data diversity."

        "title": "Multimodal Engagement- and EHR-Conditioned Large Language Model Augmentation for Clinically Realistic and Balanced Mental Health Data Synthesis",
        "Problem_Statement": "The scarcity and imbalance of clinical data in mental health diagnosis hinder the training of robust large language models (LLMs), which results in NLP systems that are biased, limited in generalizability, and fail to reflect diverse patient demographics and engagement patterns. Additionally, the disconnection of mental health data augmentation from rich longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) restricts clinical realism, especially in complex populations such as patients with comorbidities including head and neck tumors who face distinct psychiatric challenges.",
        "Motivation": "Current LLM-based augmentation approaches largely ignore the integration of real-world multimodal patient information and clinical trajectories, limiting their fidelity and utility in downstream diagnostic models. To overcome the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty gap, this research pioneers a principled methodology to incorporate temporal, behavioral, and clinical heterogeneity by conditioning data synthesis on both detailed patient engagement signals and comprehensive longitudinal EHR features. This strategy not only enhances model realism and clinical validity but also addresses an important translational nexus by targeting psychiatric comorbidities in oncology, thus innovating at the intersection of AI adoption in electronic health record use, mental health NLP, and integrated cancer care.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel multimodal conditional generative framework based on large language models that synthesizes augmented clinical mental health interview data by jointly conditioning on: (1) patient engagement features extracted and engineered from heterogeneous sources such as portal usage logs, questionnaire adherence, and temporal interaction patterns; (2) longitudinal EHR-derived clinical variables including comorbidities, treatment histories, medication data, and lab results; and (3) demographic factors ensuring balanced representation. \n\nCore Mechanistic Details:\n- **Engagement Feature Engineering:** Transform noisy engagement signals into structured temporal embeddings via time-series aggregation, session clustering, and adherence scoring. Features will capture phases of engagement (e.g., initiation, maintenance, dropout) aligned with mental health symptom dynamics.\n- **EHR Conditioning Representation:** Utilize clinical concept embeddings derived from heterogeneous EHR modalities (diagnosis codes, medications, labs), temporally aligned with engagement data, to form a multimodal conditioning vector.\n- **Generative Architecture:** Extend a transformer-based LLM with cross-attention modules tailored to incorporate the combined conditioning vectors, enabling synthesis of temporally consistent and demographically balanced clinical narratives.\n- **Bias Quantification and Mitigation:** Implement adversarial bias assessment by training auxiliary classifiers that detect demographic and engagement-related disparities in synthetic data. Incorporate a bias-regularization loss penalizing generation variance across underrepresented groups to promote equity.\n- **Algorithmic Framework:** Define a step-wise conditional generation pipeline: (a) encode engagement and EHR features into latent space; (b) condition LLM generation on these latents; (c) apply bias-aware iterative refinement to output data distributions matching target demographic and clinical properties.\n\nThis detailed, mechanistic design ensures reproducibility and rigor, aligning with standards expected at ACL/NeurIPS level contributions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate a multimodal dataset combining clinical mental health interviews, detailed patient portal engagement logs, and multi-year EHR data from patients including subsets with head and neck tumors.\n2. Develop and validate feature engineering pipelines for engagement signals and EHR clinical variables, performing temporal alignment and embedding extraction.\n3. Construct and pretrain the conditional generative LLM architecture integrating cross-attention modules for multimodal conditioning.\n4. Fine-tune generation on sparse clinical datasets from underrepresented demographic groups and oncology-psychiatric comorbidity patients.\n5. Conduct quantitative evaluations by benchmarking improvements in downstream mental health classification and symptom prediction tasks using augmented data.\n6. Measure bias pre- and post-augmentation using adversarial classifiers and disparities in performance metrics across demographic and engagement subgroups.\n7. Perform ablation studies removing engagement or EHR conditioning to isolate their individual contributions to synthetic data quality and fairness.\n8. Validate clinical realism via expert psychiatric annotation comparison, emphasizing oncology comorbid samples.\n9. Release comprehensive documentation and reproducible codebase to facilitate community adoption and further research.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sparse clinical interview transcripts from an elderly patient with low portal engagement and complex history of head and neck tumors, with longitudinal EHR indicating multimorbidity but limited mental health notes.\nOutput: Synthetic clinical interview expansions that realistically simulate temporal symptom progression, treatment adherence behaviors, and nuanced psychiatric symptomatology reflective of engagement phases and EHR comorbidities, exhibiting balanced demographic traits matching the patient subgroup. These outputs will pass bias detection sensitivity tests and align closely with known clinical epidemiology patterns for this population.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct patient engagement signals prove too noisy or incomplete, surrogate engagement proxies will be derived through machine learning models trained on population-level behavioral metrics (e.g., inferred adherence from visit frequency, medication refill patterns). If multimodal EHR integration is impeded by data access constraints, a federated learning paradigm will be adopted to enable decentralized model training across hospitals while preserving patient privacy and enhancing data diversity. In cases where conditioning complexity limits training stability, iterative curriculum learning strategies will be used to progressively incorporate engagement and EHR features, ensuring robust convergence and maintaining fairness goals."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an ambitious conditional generative approach leveraging patient engagement signals to augment clinical mental health data. However, it lacks clarity on how engagement metrics will be precisely integrated into the LLM-based generative architecture. The mechanism for translating diverse, noisy engagement data (e.g., portal usage logs, questionnaire adherence) into conditioning variables for synthetic data generation requires elaboration. Further, the adversarial bias assessment approach is described at a high level without specifying how bias will be quantitatively measured or mitigated during augmentation. Providing a clearer algorithmic framework or preliminary model design would strengthen confidence in the method's soundness and reproducibility, especially given the complexities of temporally aligned and demographically balanced data synthesis in this domain. Consider detailing the conditioning model structure, feature engineering of engagement signals, and bias detection criteria explicitly in the proposal to improve mechanistic rigor and clarity. This will also facilitate peer understanding and replication feasibility as critical for an ACL/NeurIPS-level contribution. Targeting this gap is essential before progressing to experiments or impact claims."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the globally linked concepts ('adoption of artificial intelligence', 'electronic health records', and 'head and neck tumors'), a promising way to enhance impact and novelty is to explicitly incorporate electronic health records (EHR) data integration as part of the augmentation pipeline. For instance, extending the model to condition synthetic mental health data not only on portal engagement but also on multimodal, longitudinal EHR features (e.g., comorbidities, treatment history, lab results) could increase realism and clinical utility. Additionally, exploring applications beyond general mental health, such as subpopulations with head and neck tumors facing psychiatric comorbidities, might broaden clinical relevance and align with emerging AI adoption in oncology and integrated mental health care. This multidisciplinary expansion could elevate the work's translational impact, distinguish it from existing augmentation methods, and better position it for high-profile venues by addressing broader adoption and real-world healthcare integration challenges in AI-powered psychiatric research."
