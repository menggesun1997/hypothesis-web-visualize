    "title": "Privacy-Preserving Trust-Enhancing Framework for LLM-Based Social Media Recommenders",
    "Problem_Statement": "Social media recommender systems driven by LLMs often compromise user privacy and trust due to opaque data handling and personalization mechanisms, exacerbating ethical concerns and limiting adoption of AI-driven well-being initiatives.",
    "Motivation": "This idea tackles the internal gap of trust and privacy in social media LLM systems by applying privacy-preserving and trust frameworks from critical national infrastructure cybersecurity domains, addressing Opportunity 2 by cross-domain knowledge transfer to socially sensitive AI contexts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a federated, privacy-by-design LLM recommender architecture that uses encrypted multi-party computation and differential privacy techniques to learn user preferences without exposing raw data. Integrate blockchain-based audit trails to enhance transparency and traceability of recommendation decisions. Incorporate explainability modules to clarify model outputs to users. The system dynamically adapts personalization respecting user privacy preferences and ethical constraints.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use public social media datasets augmented with simulated user privacy preferences. 2. Implement federated learning protocols with encrypted data exchanges for LLM fine-tuning of recommendation models. 3. Develop blockchain audit infrastructure for logging recommendations and data flows. 4. Evaluate recommendation quality, privacy leakage via formal metrics, transparency through user-centric studies, and trust levels compared to centralized baseline recommenders. 5. Test resilience under potential adversarial privacy attacks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user interacts with social media posts with privacy settings restricting data sharing. Expected Output: The recommender suggests context-aware content tailored to well-being objectives without raw data exposure, providing transparent audit logs accessible by the user.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated encryption proves too computationally heavy, simplify to hybrid edge-server models with anonymization safeguards. Investigate adjustable privacy-utility trade-offs and reinforce user interfaces for manual control of data sharing."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method ambitiously combines federated learning, encrypted multi-party computation, differential privacy, blockchain audit trails, and explainability modules. However, the interactions and integration points among these components require clearer elaboration. For instance, how will encryption and multi-party computation be synchronized with blockchain recording without incurring prohibitive latency or revealing sensitive information? Furthermore, the dynamic adaptation respecting both privacy preferences and ethical constraints is promising but lacks clarity on the control mechanisms and policies ensuring this adaptation is both enforceable and verifiable. Providing a more detailed system architecture and workflow, possibly with formal modeling or protocol descriptions, would significantly strengthen the methodological soundness and help anticipate potential challenges in deployment and operation. This clarity is critical to ensure the framework is well-founded and can realistically be implemented as described in the experiment plan, avoiding hidden assumptions about scalability and security guarantees. The authors should enhance this section by detailing component integration, data flow, and security protocol interactions to establish a stronger soundness foundation for their approach.\n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan presents a reasonable sequence of actions to validate the framework, including dataset usage, federated protocol implementation, audit infrastructure development, and multi-faceted evaluation criteria. However, critical feasibility concerns arise: (1) Public social media datasets typically lack privacy preference annotations and fine-grained user controls; simulating these might not fully represent realistic user behavior, potentially compromising validity. (2) Implementing encrypted federated learning combined with blockchain audit trails is computationally intensive, especially on LLM-based recommenders, but the plan does not discuss resource requirements, scalability measures, or performance baseline targets. (3) User-centric transparency and trust studies need detailed design considerations, such as participant sampling, metrics, and ethical approvals, which are not mentioned. Addressing these issues is vital to ensure experiments are practical, interpretable, and comprehensive. The authors should expand the experiment plan with concrete dataset augmentation methods, resource estimation, optimization strategies, and detailed evaluation protocols to bolster the planâ€™s scientific and practical feasibility.\n\nTarget section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
