    "title": "Federated Adaptive Compression for Resource-Aware IDS in Fog Networks",
    "Problem_Statement": "Intrusion detection systems (IDS) deployed in fog computing face a critical challenge: balancing detection accuracy with the severe resource constraints of fog nodes. Heavy models or communications overwhelm bandwidth and power budgets, while lightweight models lack precision. Current federated learning approaches do not optimize communication payload adaptively for heterogeneous fog devices, leading to inefficient resource utilization and reduced intrusion detection performance.",
    "Motivation": "This proposal directly attacks the internal gap of reconciling high detection accuracy with stringent resource limitations at fog nodes by integrating federated learning with adaptive model update compression tailored to fog resource constraints. Moreover, it leverages the hidden bridge between privacy-preserving learning and resource-aware IDS described in the landscape map to achieve efficient and private collaborative IDS training.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a federated adaptive compression framework (FedAC) where each fog node dynamically compresses its model updates using learned sparse quantization and pruning schemes based on node resource profiles (CPU, memory, bandwidth). The global aggregator integrates these compressed, privacy-preserving updates (combined with differential privacy noise injection) to build a robust IDS model efficiently. The method employs an autoencoder-based compression module that learns compression parameters during training to optimally trade off bandwidth/compute cost vs model fidelity. This architecture respects privacy via federated learning and differential privacy, with compression tailored per node to save resources without major detection accuracy loss.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Use publicly available IoT intrusion detection datasets (e.g., UNSW-NB15) with simulated fog-node heterogeneity. 2. Implement federated IDS training baseline with standard FedAvg and evaluate resource costs and accuracy. 3. Develop adaptive compression autoencoder modules at each node, integrating differential privacy noise per privacy budget constraints. 4. Compare proposed FedAC against baselines on detection accuracy, communication cost, computation time, and privacy leakage (via membership inference). 5. Conduct ablation on compression levels and node resource heterogeneity.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Local network traffic logs with labeled benign and malicious flows at a low-resource fog node (e.g., limited bandwidth and CPU). Output: Locally compressed model update with quantized weights and sparsity patterns sent to aggregator. Aggregator returns updated IDS model improving detection accuracy by >5% over baseline FedAvg without exceeding node resource budgets or compromising privacy guarantees.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive compression fails to reduce resource consumption adequately, fallback to fixed lightweight compression schemes or model pruning. If differential privacy noise degrades IDS accuracy excessively, adjust privacy budget or explore alternative privacy-preserving techniques such as secure aggregation or homomorphic encryption."

        "title": "Blockchain-enhanced Federated Adaptive Compression with Reinforcement Learning for Resource-Aware and Secure IDS in Heterogeneous Fog Networks",
        "Problem_Statement": "Intrusion detection systems (IDS) in fog computing environments must achieve high detection accuracy while coping with severe resource constraints (compute, memory, and bandwidth) and privacy requirements of heterogeneous fog nodes. Existing federated learning-based IDS approaches fail to adaptively optimize communication payloads or privacy budgets according to diverse node capabilities. Moreover, they lack mechanisms to guarantee trustworthiness and security of model aggregation against poisoning and malicious attacks typical in fog and IoT networks. This leads to inefficient resource usage, reduced detection performance, and vulnerability to adversarial manipulation, limiting real-world applicability in dynamic, constrained fog scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "We address the critical gap of achieving efficient, private, and robust federated IDS training tailored for heterogeneous fog nodes by combining adaptive model update compression, dynamic privacy budget allocation, and blockchain-based trustworthy aggregation. While prior works integrate adaptive compression or differential privacy, they do not formalize joint optimization of compression and privacy parameters under real resource constraints nor secure aggregation in adversarial fog contexts. Leveraging reinforcement learning to dynamically tune compression and privacy policy per node based on continuous feedback, combined with a decentralized immutable blockchain ledger for aggregation and auditability, we enhance resource efficiency, detection accuracy, and resilience. This novel integration advances beyond competitive prior methods by holistically tackling the intertwined challenges of resource heterogeneity, privacy, and security in fog-based IDS.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose FedAC-RL-BC, a federated adaptive compression framework augmented with reinforcement learning (RL) and blockchain-based secure aggregation for fog-based IDS. Each fog node runs: (1) an autoencoder-based compression module jointly trained with the IDS model that dynamically adjusts quantization levels and pruning sparsity considering local resource profiles; (2) a lightweight RL agent that observes node resource states, network latency, and model performance feedback to optimize compression parameters and differential privacy noise scale in real-time, balancing detection accuracy, communication overhead, and privacy budget consumption. Nodes inject calibrated differential privacy noise per RL policy and send compressed, privacy-preserving updates. A permissioned blockchain network among fog nodes and aggregator records transaction hashes of model updates, ensuring immutable traceability and secure aggregation resistant to poisoning attacks. Smart contracts validate update authenticity and enforce consensus aggregation rules. The global IDS model is updated by aggregating decrypted, decompressed updates verified via blockchain, facilitating auditability and tamper resistance. We describe the method through detailed algorithms specifying joint compression-autoencoder training synchronized with IDS update rounds, RL state-action definitions, reward functions, privacy budget accounting per node, and blockchain transaction flow to ensure clarity and reproducibility. We address heterogeneous node computation impacts on compression update synchronization and discuss asynchronous update handling to mitigate delays common in fog deployments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Employ IoT intrusion detection datasets such as UNSW-NB15 alongside newly collected heterogeneous fog-node profiles (CPU, memory, bandwidth, energy) derived from real hardware benchmarks and simulations. Simulate fog node resource heterogeneity reflecting realistic distributions and intermittent network conditions. 2. Implement baseline federated IDS using FedAvg with fixed compression and uniform privacy parameters. 3. Develop the joint autoencoder compression-IDS model training process, integrating differential privacy noise injection with privacy budget accounting. 4. Implement reinforcement learning agents per node to dynamically adjust compression parameters and privacy budgets, defining features such as resource utilization, network status, and model accuracy feedback; tune reward function balancing accuracy, resource usage, and privacy preservation. 5. Build a permissioned blockchain framework integrated with federated aggregator and nodes for secure, traceable model update aggregation, validating update integrity and supporting poisoning attack resistance. 6. Evaluate FedAC-RL-BC against baselines on a suite of metrics: intrusion detection accuracy, communication cost reduction, computation overhead per node, privacy leakage (membership inference and other metrics), robustness to network variabilities, and security under poisoning attack scenarios. 7. Perform ablations on RL-driven dynamic policy versus static heuristics, blockchain-enabled aggregation versus centralized aggregation, and compression granularity levels. 8. Conduct scalability and asynchronous update impact tests to assess practical deployment feasibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example: A low-resource fog node with limited CPU cycles and intermittent low bandwidth network performs local training on labeled malicious/benign traffic samples, dynamically adjusting its model update compression via the autoencoder guided by its RL agent. The RL agent observes current node utilization and network latency, increasing pruning sparsity and noise scale to preserve privacy without breaching accuracy thresholds. This compressed and noisy update is submitted through permissioned blockchain transactions ensuring authenticity and immutable logging. The aggregator incorporates verified, decompressed updates from all nodes, updating the global IDS model. The resultant IDS model demonstrates >7% accuracy improvement over baseline FedAvg on heterogeneous fog node setups, reducing bandwidth usage by 40% and maintaining privacy budgets per node under stringent constraints. The blockchain ledger prevents poisoning attempts from compromised nodes by validating transactions and transparently recording update provenance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If joint autoencoder compression and RL adaptation incur excessive overhead or destabilize convergence, fallback to a two-stage approach where the compression autoencoder parameters are pre-trained offline and RL optimizes only privacy budget allocation during deployment. If blockchain integration introduces unacceptable latency or complexity, implement a lightweight secure aggregation protocol with cryptographic verification (e.g., secure multiparty computation) as an alternative. Should differential privacy noise severely impair IDS accuracy, adaptively relax privacy budgets guided by RL or explore hybrid privacy-preserving schemes such as combining secure aggregation with selective noise injection. Additional fallback involves fixed compression and privacy parameter sets fine-tuned empirically for subsets of homogeneous fog node clusters to reduce heterogeneity complexity."

However, the description lacks clarity on how the autoencoder-based compression module is jointly trained with the IDS model updates, especially in a federated setting with heterogeneous nodes. It is not fully clear how the compression parameters adapt dynamically during training per node's resource profile without incurring excessive overhead or destabilizing convergence. More precise detailing of the compression-learning mechanism, its interaction with federated aggregation, and privacy budget management is necessary to establish soundness and reproducibility of the core mechanism. Consider enriching the method section with formalized algorithmic steps or system architecture illustrating training, compression updates, and integration of privacy noise explicitly to address this gap and avoid ambiguities that may affect both implementation and evaluation fidelity.\n\nTargeting this clarity early would ensure soundness and strengthen confidence in the approach's feasibility and effectiveness in the complex fog network context where resources vary widely and privacy is paramount, thus making the method more rigorously grounded and robust for competing in this crowded research area (NOV-COMPETITIVE). Furthermore, discussing potential challenges like heterogeneous computation capability impact on compression parameter updates or synchronization delays would enhance trust in the mechanism's practicality and scalability, which is vital for real-world fog IDS deployment."

Also, the plan does not address how differential privacy parameters will be chosen or tuned to balance privacy-utility trade-offs, nor how privacy leakage will be quantitatively measured beyond membership inference. \n\nTo improve feasibility and scientific rigor, the experiment plan should incorporate: (1) concrete methods for modeling or profiling diverse fog nodes reflecting real-world heterogeneity in resource limitations; (2) detailed design on privacy budget allocation and its interaction with adaptive compression (e.g., noise scale adaptation based on compression level or node capacity); (3) clear metrics and protocols for measuring communication cost reduction, computation overhead, and detection accuracy jointly; (4) robustness checks under varying network conditions, such as intermittent connectivity common in fog environments.\n\nAdding these refinements will better validate the framework's practical feasibility and its mounting impact claims, while providing meaningful insights into the scalability and resilience of FedAC under realistic deployment scenarios."

These additions align well with globally-linked concepts like 'blockchain-based architecture', 'dynamic policy update', and 'reinforcement learning'.\n\nSuch integration would elevate the work's practical impact and novelty by addressing not only resource and privacy concerns but also emerging security and trust challenges in distributed fog-based IDS deployment, providing a more comprehensive and resilient defense framework suited for heterogeneous and adversarial real-world IoT environments."
