    "title": "Explainable Homomorphic Ensemble Models for Transparent Fog IDS",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current AI/ML-based IDS for fog architectures suffer from low interpretability, particularly when ensemble models or complex architectures are employed. Additionally, the integration of encryption techniques like homomorphic encryption to protect data during inference further obfuscates model transparency. This lack of interpretability undermines trust and hinders operational deployment in sensitive resource-constrained fog environments.",
    "Motivation": "This proposal answers the gap of insufficient transparency and interpretability in AI/ML IDS systems while also embracing edge-aware homomorphic encryption as highlighted in the high-potential innovation opportunities. We aim to build an inherently interpretable yet encrypted ensemble IDS that fosters trust without compromising security or efficiency.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We design a novel IDS framework combining inherently interpretable ensemble learners (e.g., rule-based boosted trees and decision sets) integrated within a homomorphic encryption inference pipeline. The ensemble is structured modularly to map decisions to understandable rules, while homomorphic encryption allows inference over encrypted data at fog nodes. To maintain interpretability post-encryption, a secure side-channel methodology is employed wherein encrypted intermediate decisions correspond to human-readable explanations via a pre-shared context. This fusion ensures transparent, encrypted, real-time IDS capable of deploying on fog nodes with constrained resources, maximizing user trust and security simultaneously.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset: Utilize fog-relevant IDS datasets with TCP/IP flow features and labeled attacks. 2. Implement base interpretability ensemble models without encryption as baseline. 3. Integrate state-of-the-art homomorphic encryption libraries for edge inferencing. 4. Develop the explanation extraction mechanism by correlating encrypted intermediate outputs with textual rule sets. 5. Benchmark detection accuracy, inference latency, and interpretability quality (via human expert evaluation and fidelity metrics). 6. Compare against opaque encrypted deep-learning-based IDS methods.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Encrypted network feature vectors captured by a fog node from an IoT device. Output: Encrypted intrusion prediction plus accessible human-readable explanation such as \"Alert: Suspicious SYN flood detected because of high connection requests (Rule 12 triggered)\" while preserving data confidentiality end-to-end.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If homomorphic encryption overhead proves prohibitive on fog hardware, explore lightweight secure multiparty computation as an alternative encryption method or reduce model complexity further while retaining interpretability. Also consider hybrid edge-cloud schemes where explanations are computed off-device under strict privacy policies."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposal outlines an innovative integration of inherently interpretable ensemble models with homomorphic encryption and a secure side-channel explanation mechanism, the specifics of the explanation extraction method and its security guarantees lack clarity. How encrypted intermediate outputs reliably map to human-readable rules without risking information leakage, and how the pre-shared context is managed securely, require more rigorous description and formal analysis. Clarifying these mechanisms is crucial to establish soundness of the method and to convince that interpretability is retained without compromising encryption integrity or introducing side-channel vulnerabilities in the constrained fog environment, where resources and adversary capabilities differ from more powerful cloud settings. Including threat models and clear algorithmic steps will strengthen this core contribution's credibility and technical soundness in the Proposed_Method section."

However, feasibility concerns arise regarding the resource constraints and real-time inference requirements on fog nodes using state-of-the-art homomorphic encryption, known for computational intensity. The plan should explicitly include performance profiling of homomorphic encryption on representative fog hardware early in the pipeline to evaluate viability and guide fallback strategy adoption timely. Furthermore, the reliance on human expert evaluation for interpretability quality, while valuable, could benefit from augmented automated quantitative measures and user studies reflecting fog environment operator capabilities. Detailed specifications of encryption parameter selections, model complexity scaling, and fallback triggers are necessary to assure experimental robustness, repeatability, and practical feasibility in the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan."
