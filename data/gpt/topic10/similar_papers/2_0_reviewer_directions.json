    "title": "Patient-Portal-Driven LLM Chatbots for Trustworthy Mental Health Support",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing AI chatbots in mental health lack deep integration with patient engagement platforms such as patient portals, resulting in diminished user trust, transparency, and acceptance, which limits their effective deployment in chronic disease management and psychiatric care.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical internal gaps of trust and transparency in hybrid chatbot integration and the external gap revealed by the hidden bridge linking patient engagement and electronic health records. This idea innovates by embedding AI-powered chatbots within patient portal environments, leveraging native functionalities to empower patients and foster trust.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an LLM-driven hybrid chatbot system integrated directly into patient portals, utilizing personalized access to EHR data via secure context-aware permissioning. Incorporate advanced explainability modules that dynamically generate transparent explanations for chatbot recommendations and responses using patient-specific metadata. The system also includes adaptive adherence support features that interactively nudge patients based on behavioral analytics derived from chatbot interactions and portal activity, combining generative data augmentation for training robustness.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets combining EHR patient portal logs and clinical interview transcripts.\n2. Fine-tune a GPT-based model incorporating attribute-based access control features.\n3. Benchmark with existing chatbot models lacking portal integration on metrics like user trust, interaction transparency, and engagement.\n4. Conduct controlled user studies with chronic disease and psychiatric patient cohorts.\n5. Use metrics including System Usability Scale (SUS), Trust in Automation, and adherence rates.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"I've been feeling anxious lately; can you help me understand what might be causing this?\" plus access to patient's recorded medication adherence and recent symptom reports.\nOutput: \"Based on your recent symptom tracking and medication adjustments logged in your portal, it appears that stress levels have increased recently, possibly due to medication side effects. Would you like suggestions on coping strategies or to schedule a consultation with your provider? Here's how this aligns with your treatment plan, with transparency reports.”",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If integration leads to privacy concerns or complexity, fallback to a modular chatbot that uses synthetic anonymized patient data augmented with general behavioral models for adherence support. Alternatively, focus on explainability modules separately to improve trust without full portal integration."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan presents a logical framework but lacks detailed consideration of privacy, ethical approval processes, and real-world deployment challenges inherent in accessing EHR and patient portal data. The plan should explicitly address data governance frameworks, patient consent management, and integration challenges with diverse EHR systems to demonstrate feasibility. Additionally, behavioral analytics and their validation metrics should be clarified with respect to modeling patient adherence and engagement, ensuring measures are clinically meaningful and scalable beyond pilot cohorts. Enhancing methodological clarity here is crucial for convincing feasibility assessment and future reproducibility of results within clinical settings."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict, augmenting the idea with 'social determinants of health' (SDoH data) integration could substantially increase impact and differentiation. Embedding SDoH data and patient-centered model of care elements into the chatbot's contextual reasoning would allow for more holistic, equity-promoting mental health support that goes beyond clinical data. Such integration aligns with the globally linked concepts like 'promote health equity' and 'patients' social needs' and can expand intervention relevance to underserved communities. Proposing modular extensions or adaptive models incorporating SDoH input could broaden the chatbot’s utility and foster stronger engagement, addressing systemic barriers in mental health management."
