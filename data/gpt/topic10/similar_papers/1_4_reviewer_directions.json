    "title": "Agentic AI for Privacy-Compliant Proactive Moderation in Social Media Recommender Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Proactive moderation of harmful content often conflicts with user privacy and autonomy, creating challenges in balancing intervention effectiveness with ethical considerations.",
    "Motivation": "Innovatively combining agentic AI with privacy-preserving frameworks addresses the external gap of integrating cybersecurity resilience with social media ethical oversight, enabling proactive yet privacy-compliant moderation mechanisms.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop agentic AI moderators embedded in recommender systems that utilize encrypted data streams and on-device inference to detect and moderate harmful content proactively. The agents negotiate intervention actions with users, preserving choice and transparency. They employ trust-enhancing explainability models to justify moderation decisions, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and societal norms.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets with privacy constraints and harmful content annotations. 2. Implement encrypted on-device LLM architectures for content analysis. 3. Create agentic decision modules for intervention negotiation. 4. Test system for moderation accuracy, privacy guarantees, user acceptance, and compliance with ethical benchmarks. 5. Perform A/B tests comparing traditional moderation to agentic privacy-first models.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User shares borderline hate speech content. Expected Output: Agent notifies user with explanations, suggests modification or removal options, and only escalates if user consents, maintaining privacy and autonomy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If on-device inference limits capabilities, shift to hybrid cloud-edge models with robust anonymization. Enhance user education and control interfaces for moderation acceptance."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method presents an innovative integration of agentic AI, encrypted data streams, and on-device inference, but the mechanism by which agentic AI agents negotiate interventions with users remains under-specified. Clarify how these negotiation processes will operate in real-time, what criteria the agents use to decide escalation versus user deferral, and how explainability models concretely enhance trust without compromising privacy. More detailed theoretical or architectural descriptions would strengthen the soundness of the approach and ensure its practical applicability in diverse social media contexts. Current ambiguity risks impeding reproducibility and evaluation clarity, especially given constraints imposed by privacy regulations and autonomy preservation goals. Consider including formal protocols or algorithmic frameworks for these agent-user interactions and explanation generation within encrypted or on-device environments to improve reliability and robustness of the method's core mechanism understanding and validation."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "While the step-by-step experiment plan outlines major milestones, it lacks detailed methodological rigor and contingency specifics vital for feasibility assessment. The plan should elaborate on how to practically collect datasets under privacy constraints while ensuring sufficient harmful content representation, including legal and ethical approvals and anonymization protocols. Additionally, the implementation challenge of encrypted on-device large language models demands a more granular approach with benchmarks on computational feasibility, latency, and accuracy trade-offs, including fallback scalability considerations. Evaluation metrics for 'trust-enhancing explainability' and 'user acceptance' require precise operationalizationâ€”e.g., defined questionnaires, behavioral measures, or trust proxies. The proposed A/B tests could be expanded to include longitudinal studies to observe behavior changes over time. Strengthening experimental details and risk mitigation strategies will enhance reproducibility, validate feasibility claims, and increase confidence in real-world deployment potential."
