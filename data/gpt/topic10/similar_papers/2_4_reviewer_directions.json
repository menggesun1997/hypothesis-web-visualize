    "title": "Cross-Disciplinary LLM-Powered Adherence Support System Integrating Psychiatric Nursing and EHR Interfaces",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of integrated adherence support systems combining psychiatric nursing best practices with electronic health record functionalities limits effective patient engagement and treatment adherence in mental health care.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external hidden bridge gap between patient engagement, psychiatric nursing, and EHR by synthesizing these domains into AI-driven adherence interventions embedded within clinical workflows. The novel contribution is a human-centric, AI-augmented adherence support platform contextualized by psychiatric nursing insights.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an AI platform combining LLMs trained on psychiatric nursing literature, clinical care pathways, and EHR metadata to provide personalized adherence recommendations and reminders. The system leverages patient portal interactions, nurse-generated annotations, and real-time clinical notes to dynamically adapt support messages. It includes feedback loops for nurses to review AI interventions and adjust guidance, enabling continuous improvement and ethical oversight.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Aggregate psychiatric nursing guidelines, EHR data, and patient portal logs.\n2. Train LLMs for adherence recommendation generation.\n3. Implement interfaces for nursing review and feedback.\n4. Conduct pilot studies in psychiatric clinics measuring adherence improvement and acceptability.\n5. Evaluate using adherence rates, user satisfaction, and bias audits.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient with a history of sporadic medication adherence and notes from nurses indicating barriers.\nOutput: Tailored reminder schedules, motivational messages, and scheduling of nurse follow-ups via portal integration, all compliant with ethical standards and culturally sensitive.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If nurse feedback is limited, incorporate passive monitoring from portal usage data. If real-time adaptation is hard, deploy static protocol-based adherence support modules."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section outlines a promising AI-driven platform leveraging LLMs and psychiatric nursing insights. However, the actual mechanism for integrating multi-source data (psychiatric nursing literature, EHR metadata, patient portal logs, nurse annotations) and dynamically adapting support messages remains underspecified. It is unclear how the LLM will effectively merge heterogeneous inputs and contextualize recommendations in real time, especially given challenges like noisy data, diverse clinical workflows, and ethical considerations. Clarifying the model architecture, data fusion strategy, and decision logic is essential to demonstrate soundness of the mechanism and build confidence in reliability and safety of the generated adherence interventions. Consider specifying whether the approach involves multimodal representation learning, domain adaptation, or rule-based components complementing the LLM outputs to address complexity and maintain interpretability for nurse review loops. This clarity will improve trust, reproducibility, and facilitate effective implementation within clinical workflows for psychiatric care adherence support. This point is critical for the innovator to address first to validate the foundational technical feasibility and clinical applicability of the system before proceeding to experiments or scaling impact ambitions.\n\n"

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan provides a high-level roadmap but lacks critical operational details necessary to assess feasibility. For example, the plan should specify data volume, quality, and access strategies for aggregating psychiatric nursing guidelines and EHR data, which are known to have stringent privacy and interoperability constraints. It also omits discussion on how to recruit pilot clinics, handle potential ethical and regulatory approvals, and which quantitative and qualitative adherence metrics will be used beyond general 'user satisfaction' and 'bias audits.' Furthermore, contingency strategies for dealing with limited nurse feedback or real-time adaptation challenges are stated but could be better integrated into iterative experiment design to ensure robust validation. Strengthening experimental protocols, defining clear success criteria, controls or baselines, and outlining risk mitigation for data and deployment challenges are essential. Delivering a detailed and scientifically rigorous experiment plan is pivotal for the innovator to establish the proposed system's viability and clinical impact in real-world mental health environments.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment, the project could significantly enhance its impact and distinctiveness by incorporating insights from clinical decision support systems (CDSS) research, a closely related but distinct area known for mature integration of AI with EHR workflows. Specifically, aligning the AI adherence recommendations with CDSS frameworks could improve interpretability, safety, and clinician trust. Additionally, exploring nutritional psychiatry interventions might be informative, as the International Union of Nutritional Sciences focuses on nutritional impacts on health, and integrating dietary adherence support could enrich patient engagement and holistic care strategies. Suggest expanding the platform's scope to include multimodal adherence factors and extending collaboration with CDSS experts and nutritional science frameworks to create a truly cross-disciplinary, comprehensive adherence system that elevates both innovation and real-world applicability."
