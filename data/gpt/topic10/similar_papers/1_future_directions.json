        "title": "Agentic AI Virtual Companions for Real-Time Social Media Harm Mitigation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current social media environments expose users to harmful content that negatively impacts collective well-being. Existing AI systems primarily react rather than proactively intervene, and user autonomy is often compromised. There is a critical need for agentic AI systems embedded within virtual companions that can detect harmful content proactively and intervene in real time without infringing on autonomy.",
        "Motivation": "This project addresses the critical gap of lacking agentic AI methods in social media platforms and expands on Opportunity 1 by integrating agentic AI from critical infrastructure protection research to enhance social media virtual companions' capabilities for proactive intervention, thereby improving ethical oversight and resilience.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an autonomous agentic AI framework composed of virtual companions that monitor user interactions and content streams continuously. These agents employ multi-modal LLMs fused with reinforcement learning policies adapted from critical infrastructure protection systems to detect harmful content patterns early. The system supports user autonomy through adjustable intervention levels and transparent explanations. A hybrid human-AI loop ensures expert oversight and ethical governance while enabling adaptive learning to evolving threats.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect and preprocess large-scale social media datasets with labeled harmful content and user interaction logs. 2. Design multi-modal LLMs (text, image, video) integrated with reinforcement learning agents capable of proactive intervention. 3. Train models using simulated social media environments with adversarial harmful content generation. 4. Evaluate detection accuracy, intervention timeliness, user autonomy retention (via surveys), and overall collective well-being gains against baseline reactive systems. 5. Conduct user studies with virtual companions to assess usability and acceptance.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A social media conversation thread contains emerging harmful misinformation spreading rapidly. Expected Output: The agentic virtual companion alerts the user with a clear explanation, suggesting alternative credible sources and, if user opts in, flags harmful content to the platform for containment, preserving user control.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If agentic AI cannot achieve reliable proactive detection, fallback to enhanced semi-autonomous systems providing real-time harm alerts for user review. Incorporate active human moderation loops more prominently. Perform error analysis to identify failure modes and refine detection heuristics."

        "title": "Privacy-Preserving Trust-Enhancing Framework for LLM-Based Social Media Recommenders",
        "Problem_Statement": "Social media recommender systems driven by LLMs often compromise user privacy and trust due to opaque data handling and personalization mechanisms, exacerbating ethical concerns and limiting adoption of AI-driven well-being initiatives.",
        "Motivation": "This idea tackles the internal gap of trust and privacy in social media LLM systems by applying privacy-preserving and trust frameworks from critical national infrastructure cybersecurity domains, addressing Opportunity 2 by cross-domain knowledge transfer to socially sensitive AI contexts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a federated, privacy-by-design LLM recommender architecture that uses encrypted multi-party computation and differential privacy techniques to learn user preferences without exposing raw data. Integrate blockchain-based audit trails to enhance transparency and traceability of recommendation decisions. Incorporate explainability modules to clarify model outputs to users. The system dynamically adapts personalization respecting user privacy preferences and ethical constraints.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use public social media datasets augmented with simulated user privacy preferences. 2. Implement federated learning protocols with encrypted data exchanges for LLM fine-tuning of recommendation models. 3. Develop blockchain audit infrastructure for logging recommendations and data flows. 4. Evaluate recommendation quality, privacy leakage via formal metrics, transparency through user-centric studies, and trust levels compared to centralized baseline recommenders. 5. Test resilience under potential adversarial privacy attacks.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user interacts with social media posts with privacy settings restricting data sharing. Expected Output: The recommender suggests context-aware content tailored to well-being objectives without raw data exposure, providing transparent audit logs accessible by the user.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated encryption proves too computationally heavy, simplify to hybrid edge-server models with anonymization safeguards. Investigate adjustable privacy-utility trade-offs and reinforce user interfaces for manual control of data sharing."

        "title": "Multi-Modal Foundation Model Decision Paradigms for Context-Aware Community Well-Being Recommendations",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing social media recommendation algorithms heavily optimize for engagement metrics, neglecting adaptive promotion of community-specific well-being goals and expert oversight, resulting in potential social harms and reduced collective health.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the critical gap of insufficient integration of multi-modal foundation model decision-making paradigms in social media, this project expands on Opportunity 3 to move beyond engagement toward context-aware, ethically guided recommendation frameworks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-modal foundation model framework combining text, image, and social graph data into a unified representation. Employ an adaptive decision-making layer guided by expert-curated well-being objectives per community context, using constrained optimization and reinforcement learning to balance engagement with ethical goals. Integrate expert-in-the-loop feedback cycles for continual adjustment and validation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Aggregate multi-modal social media datasets labeled by community demographics and well-being indicators. 2. Pretrain multi-modal foundation models with aligned embeddings. 3. Formulate decision policies integrating community-specific constraints and well-being metrics. 4. Benchmark against engagement-maximizing recommenders on metrics including content diversity, well-being scores, and ethical compliance. 5. Conduct expert panel reviews alongside user studies for qualitative validation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A social media group exhibiting rising anxiety posts. Expected Output: Recommendations shift to calming, positive content identified via multi-modal signals, validated by experts and correlated with improved group sentiment over time.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-modal fusion underperforms, prioritize single-modality incremental improvements and increase expert feedback frequency. Utilize simplified ethical constraint proxies and more interpretable models."

        "Motivation": "Filling the internal gap of ethical governance and long-term adaptation by synthesizing cross-domain approaches from resilient critical infrastructure management with social media AI ethics, creating robust, adaptive oversight mechanisms.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a meta-governance framework combining reinforcement learning-based adaptive policy modules with human-in-the-loop ethical committees. The system continuously monitors social media AI impacts, updates ethical rules dynamically, and integrates multi-stakeholder feedback loops through transparent dashboards and explainable AI to ensure alignment with evolving norms and values.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Map existing ethical policies across domains (social media, cybersecurity, infrastructure). 2. Build simulation environments replicating social media ecosystems with evolving user behaviors and values. 3. Train adaptive governance modules to respond to emerging ethical dilemmas. 4. Evaluate through longitudinal studies on system trustworthiness, ethical conflict resolution, and user satisfaction. 5. Compare to static governance models in preventing ethical breaches.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Emergence of new misinformation modality requires policy update. Expected Output: Adaptive governance autonomously revises intervention strategies approved by oversight committees, maintaining ethical balance and user freedom.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If autonomous adaptation risks unintended policies, incorporate stricter human approval stages and limit autonomy scope. Increase transparency and simulation fidelity for better prediction of policy impacts."
