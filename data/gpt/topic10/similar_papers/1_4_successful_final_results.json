        "title": "Agentic AI for Privacy-Compliant Proactive Moderation in Social Media Recommender Systems with Human-Centered Negotiation Protocols",
        "Problem_Statement": "Proactive moderation of harmful content in social media recommender systems must balance effective intervention with rigorous preservation of user privacy and autonomy, but existing approaches either compromise privacy through centralized analysis or limit user agency by enforcing blunt moderation actions, leading to ethical and operational challenges.",
        "Motivation": "Although prior research integrates encrypted data processing and on-device inference to enhance privacy, the critical gap remains in specifying interactive, agentic negotiation mechanisms between AI moderators and users within privacy-preserving frameworks. Our approach innovatively advances the integration of agentic AI with privacy-enhanced on-device architectures, embedding formal, real-time negotiation and trust-building protocols that uphold autonomy and transparency. By explicitly addressing the human-centered dynamics of intervention, this proposal surpasses current competitive methods, advancing the state of the art in privacy-compliant, user-centric moderation aligned with evolving digital media sociological insights and corporate sustainability imperatives.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-layered agentic AI moderation architecture embedded in social media recommender systems, comprising the following key components: (1) Encrypted on-device inference modules leveraging lightweight, distilled transformer models optimized for local execution to respect privacy and latency constraints; (2) A formally defined negotiation protocol modeled as a decision-theoretic multi-turn interaction between AI agents and users, incorporating probabilistic user preference estimations and risk thresholds to dynamically decide intervention escalation versus deferral; (3) Explainability modules based on privacy-preserving post-hoc explanation algorithms generating interpretable, minimal disclosure rationales (e.g., counterfactual snippets, feature importance) displayed via user interfaces co-designed for trust enhancement; (4) Integration of human-centered AI design principles ensuring interventions emphasize user autonomy and informed consent; (5) Continuous adaptation informed by longitudinal user feedback and media sociology insights to refine moderation strategies respecting digital media economies and sociocultural norms; (6) Strict compliance with privacy regulations through on-device data handling, end-to-end encryption, and transparent control dashboards empowering users with clear oversight and intervention customization. Architecturally, the agent negotiation mechanism uses a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework wherein the AI agent infers latent variables about content harmfulness and user tolerance, negotiating with users through a structured dialogue protocol defined by algorithmic policies trained via reinforcement learning on anonymized simulation data. Explainability outputs leverage modified LIME/SHAP methods compatible with encrypted environments, ensuring no private data leakage while maximizing interpretability. This comprehensive, scalable framework innovatively unites AI assistance, media sociology, and corporate sustainability within a robust digital media ecosystem.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Ethical Dataset Construction: Collaborate with social media platforms and ethics boards to collect datasets annotated for harmful content under strict privacy, anonymization, and differential privacy protocols, ensuring legal compliance and sociological representativeness. 2. On-Device Model Development: Optimize and benchmark encrypted, distilled transformer models for latency, accuracy, and computational feasibility on representative smartphone and edge hardware. 3. Formal Protocol Implementation: Develop and validate the POMDP-based negotiation algorithms, simulating real-time interactions with synthetic and anonymized user data to tune decision policies and escalation thresholds. 4. Explainability Module Integration: Implement privacy-preserving explanation algorithms, evaluating clarity, user comprehension, and trust metrics in controlled user studies. 5. User-Centered Interface Design: Co-design intervention interfaces through iterative participatory design workshops to maximize clarity, consent, and autonomy preservation. 6. Evaluation Framework: Define multi-dimensional metrics including moderation accuracy, privacy guarantee validation (through formal proofs and audits), user acceptance measured by standardized trust and autonomy questionnaires (e.g., adapted Trust in Automation scale), behavioral analytics, and compliance with ethical benchmarks. Include A/B tests comparing traditional centralized moderation, agentic AI without negotiation, and the proposed method, extended to longitudinal studies over several months to capture behavior changes and system adaptation. 7. Scalability and Fallback Testing: In scenarios where on-device inference is insufficient, evaluate hybrid cloud-edge fallbacks with robust anonymization pipelines and enhanced user control mechanisms, measuring trade-offs in latency, privacy, and acceptance.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User shares borderline hate speech content via the recommender interface. Expected Output: Agentic AI detects potential harm and initiates a real-time, user-facing negotiation dialogue: (1) Notifies the user with a minimal, privacy-preserving explanation (e.g., 'Some language in your post may be interpreted as harmful because...'), (2) Offers modification suggestions or warnings, (3) Allows user to accept, edit, or remove content, (4) Only escalates to platform moderation with explicit user consent or under predefined high-risk conditions. Interaction logs demonstrate POMDP decision steps and include user feedback to iteratively refine future interventions, maintaining strict privacy guarantees at all stages.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should encrypted on-device inference impose insurmountable resource constraints, transition to a hybrid cloud-edge architecture where sensitive content features are processed locally for initial filtering, and only anonymized, aggregated metadata are securely transmitted for deeper analysis. Complement this with enhanced user education modules and transparent control interfaces to boost user trust, informed consent, and acceptance. Continuous monitoring of latency, privacy leakage risk, and user behavioral metrics will guide incremental optimization and assure adherence to corporate sustainability and ethical standards."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method presents an innovative integration of agentic AI, encrypted data streams, and on-device inference, but the mechanism by which agentic AI agents negotiate interventions with users remains under-specified. Clarify how these negotiation processes will operate in real-time, what criteria the agents use to decide escalation versus user deferral, and how explainability models concretely enhance trust without compromising privacy. More detailed theoretical or architectural descriptions would strengthen the soundness of the approach and ensure its practical applicability in diverse social media contexts. Current ambiguity risks impeding reproducibility and evaluation clarity, especially given constraints imposed by privacy regulations and autonomy preservation goals. Consider including formal protocols or algorithmic frameworks for these agent-user interactions and explanation generation within encrypted or on-device environments to improve reliability and robustness of the method's core mechanism understanding and validation."

          "feedback_content": "While the step-by-step experiment plan outlines major milestones, it lacks detailed methodological rigor and contingency specifics vital for feasibility assessment. The plan should elaborate on how to practically collect datasets under privacy constraints while ensuring sufficient harmful content representation, including legal and ethical approvals and anonymization protocols. Additionally, the implementation challenge of encrypted on-device large language models demands a more granular approach with benchmarks on computational feasibility, latency, and accuracy trade-offs, including fallback scalability considerations. Evaluation metrics for 'trust-enhancing explainability' and 'user acceptance' require precise operationalization—e.g., defined questionnaires, behavioral measures, or trust proxies. The proposed A/B tests could be expanded to include longitudinal studies to observe behavior changes over time. Strengthening experimental details and risk mitigation strategies will enhance reproducibility, validate feasibility claims, and increase confidence in real-world deployment potential."
