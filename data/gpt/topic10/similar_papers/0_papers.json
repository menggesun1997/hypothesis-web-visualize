    "abstract": "Intelligent decision-making (IDM) is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to automate or augment decision processes. Modern IDM paradigms integrate advanced frameworks to enable intelligent agents to make effective and adaptive choices and decompose complex tasks into manageable steps, such as AI agents and high-level reinforcement learning. Recent advances in multimodal foundation-based approaches unify diverse input modalities-such as vision, language, and sensory data-into a cohesive decision-making process. Foundation models (FMs) have become pivotal in science and industry, transforming decision-making and research capabilities. Their large-scale, multimodal data-processing abilities foster adaptability and interdisciplinary breakthroughs across fields such as healthcare, life sciences, and education. This survey examines IDM's evolution, advanced paradigms with FMs and their transformative impact on decision-making across diverse scientific and industrial domains, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in building efficient, adaptive, and ethical decision systems.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and automation are transforming catalyst discovery and design from traditional trial-and-error manual mode into intelligent, high-throughput digital methodologies. This transformation is driven by four key components, including high-throughput information extraction, automated robotic experimentation, real-time feedback for iterative optimization, and interpretable machine learning for generating new knowledge. These innovations have given rise to the development of self-driving labs and significantly accelerated materials research. Over the past two years, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has added a new dimension to this field, providing unprecedented flexibility in information integration, decision-making, and interacting with human researchers. This review explores how LLMs are reshaping catalyst design, heralding a revolutionary change in the fields.",

    "title": "Generative spatial artificial intelligence for sustainable smart cities: A pioneering large flow model for urban digital twin",
    "year": 2025,
    "citationCount": 13,
    "fieldCitationRatio": NaN,
    "abstract": "Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies-such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks-to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows-namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity-critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in materials design is revolutionizing the field of materials engineering thanks to their power to predict material properties, design de novo materials with enhanced features, and discover new mechanisms beyond intuition. In addition, they can be used to infer complex design principles and identify high-quality candidates more rapidly than trial-and-error experimentation. From this perspective, herein we describe how these tools can enable the acceleration and enrichment of each stage of the discovery cycle of novel materials with optimized properties. We begin by outlining the state-of-the-art AI models in materials design, including machine learning (ML), deep learning, and materials informatics tools. These methodologies enable the extraction of meaningful information from vast amounts of data, enabling researchers to uncover complex correlations and patterns within material properties, structures, and compositions. Next, a comprehensive overview of AI-driven materials design is provided and its potential future prospects are highlighted. By leveraging such AI algorithms, researchers can efficiently search and analyze databases containing a wide range of material properties, enabling the identification of promising candidates for specific applications. This capability has profound implications across various industries, from drug development to energy storage, where materials performance is crucial. Ultimately, AI-based approaches are poised to revolutionize our understanding and design of materials, ushering in a new era of accelerated innovation and advancement.",
