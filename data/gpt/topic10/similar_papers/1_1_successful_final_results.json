        "title": "Privacy-Preserving Trust-Enhancing Framework for LLM-Based Social Media Recommenders with Integrated System Architecture and Feasibility Focus",
        "Problem_Statement": "Social media recommender systems leveraging large language models (LLMs) risk compromising user privacy and trust due to opaque data handling, personalization mechanisms, and insufficient transparency. These risks challenge ethical AI deployment and hinder user adoption, particularly for AI-driven well-being and socially sensitive applications where privacy, trust, and explainability are paramount.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work explores privacy and trust in recommender systems, our approach distinctively integrates advanced privacy-preserving methods with a transparent, verifiable, and dynamically adaptable architecture inspired by critical national infrastructure cybersecurity frameworks. Unlike existing systems, we explicitly model and formalize component interactions, ensuring enforceable privacy-utility trade-offs and trust guarantees. By transferring privacy-accuracy trade-off concepts and decentralized model training techniques to the social media LLM recommender domain, we address key research challenges around scalability, transparency, and human-centric AI adoption, positioning our framework as a novel and practical advance over conventional recommender systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular federated learning (FL) based framework enhanced with encrypted multi-party computation (MPC), differential privacy (DP), blockchain audit trails, and user-centric explainability, formally specified to ensure sound integration and enforceability. \n\n1. System Architecture and Workflow: A federated LLM recommender is deployed across user edge devices and aggregator servers, leveraging a FL platform optimized for scalable large model fine-tuning.\n2. Encrypted MPC protocols enable secure model updates aggregation without raw data sharing, synchronized with blockchain smart contracts that log metadata and cryptographic proofs ensuring auditability while preserving sensitive information.\n3. The blockchain component is designed with latency-aware batching and off-chain computation to mitigate performance overheads.\n4. DP mechanisms inject calibrated noise to model gradients, balancing privacy-accuracy trade-offs, parameterized per user preferences.\n5. Dynamic adaptation is governed by a formal policy engine enforcing privacy constraints and ethical guidelines onboard user profiles; policies are verifiable via on-chain compliance proofs and mutable user consent records.\n6. Explainability modules use natural language understanding and graph representation learning to generate individualized, comprehensible rationale for recommendations, integrated into a user interface that supports manual privacy preference adjustments.\n\nThis architecture explicitly models component interactions, data flows, and security protocols, with formal descriptions enabling verification and scalability analysis, distinguishing it from prior fragmented approaches.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset Preparation: Utilize public social media datasets (e.g., Twitter, Reddit) and augment with synthetically generated, statistically realistic user privacy preferences and consent profiles using generative models informed by privacy-accuracy trade-off research.\n2. Implementation: Deploy an efficient FL platform supporting LLM fine-tuning with encrypted MPC using state-of-the-art cryptographic libraries optimized for latency; integrate a permissioned blockchain to record hashed metadata and compliance proofs with scalable off-chain protocol designs.\n3. Policy Engine and Explainability: Develop formal policy specifications supporting dynamic user privacy and ethical constraints; implement explainability modules utilizing graph representation learning and NLP techniques to produce user-intelligible justifications.\n4. Evaluation Metrics: Measure recommendation quality (e.g., NDCG, precision), privacy leakage using formal privacy loss accounting under DP, system latency/performance benchmarks, and compliance enforcement correctness.\n5. User Studies: Conduct human-subject transparency and trust assessments with a balanced participant sample, leveraging validated UX trust metrics and ethical board approvals; incorporate qualitative and quantitative analyses.\n6. Resilience Testing: Simulate adversarial privacy attacks (e.g., inference, poisoning) to evaluate security robustness.\n7. Resource and Scalability Assessment: Profile computational costs and optimize model-player assignments to balance privacy with real-world feasibility.\n\nThis comprehensive plan prioritizes practical feasibility, interpretability, and scientific rigor.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user on a social media platform with defined privacy preferences rejecting raw data sharing and permitting personalized recommendations with explainability.\nOutput: The recommender suggests context-aware, well-being oriented content generated by fine-tuned LLMs through federated encrypted updates, with differential privacy guarantees. Blockchain audit logs provide verifiable, tamper-proof proofs of compliance without revealing sensitive data. The user interface offers clear explanations of why content was recommended and allows dynamic adjustment of privacy policies. Latency and performance remain within acceptable limits for real-time usage.\nTest scenarios include normal operation, user policy changes mid-session, and adversarial attempts to breach privacy.\n",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should encrypted MPC prove computationally prohibitive for large LLMs, we will implement a hybrid hierarchical FL system where lightweight models perform on-device personalization, with server-side aggregated model coordination using anonymized gradient sharing. Privacy safeguards will be reinforced by advanced anonymization and DP tuning to compensate for reduced cryptographic guarantees. User interfaces will be enhanced to empower manual, fine-grained control over data sharing and personalization scope. Additionally, we will explore offloading explainability computations to edge-cloud collaboration to meet latency demands, ensuring the framework remains viable for deployment despite resource constraints."

However, the interactions and integration points among these components require clearer elaboration. For instance, how will encryption and multi-party computation be synchronized with blockchain recording without incurring prohibitive latency or revealing sensitive information? Furthermore, the dynamic adaptation respecting both privacy preferences and ethical constraints is promising but lacks clarity on the control mechanisms and policies ensuring this adaptation is both enforceable and verifiable. Providing a more detailed system architecture and workflow, possibly with formal modeling or protocol descriptions, would significantly strengthen the methodological soundness and help anticipate potential challenges in deployment and operation. This clarity is critical to ensure the framework is well-founded and can realistically be implemented as described in the experiment plan, avoiding hidden assumptions about scalability and security guarantees. The authors should enhance this section by detailing component integration, data flow, and security protocol interactions to establish a stronger soundness foundation for their approach.\n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"

However, critical feasibility concerns arise: (1) Public social media datasets typically lack privacy preference annotations and fine-grained user controls; simulating these might not fully represent realistic user behavior, potentially compromising validity. (2) Implementing encrypted federated learning combined with blockchain audit trails is computationally intensive, especially on LLM-based recommenders, but the plan does not discuss resource requirements, scalability measures, or performance baseline targets. (3) User-centric transparency and trust studies need detailed design considerations, such as participant sampling, metrics, and ethical approvals, which are not mentioned. Addressing these issues is vital to ensure experiments are practical, interpretable, and comprehensive. The authors should expand the experiment plan with concrete dataset augmentation methods, resource estimation, optimization strategies, and detailed evaluation protocols to bolster the plan’s scientific and practical feasibility.\n\nTarget section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
