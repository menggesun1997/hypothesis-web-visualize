Data programming has emerged as a new paradigm to address this issue by converting human knowledge into labeling functions (LFs) to quickly produce low-cost probabilistic labels. To ensure the quality of labeled data, data programmers commonly iterate LFs for many rounds until satisfactory performance is achieved. However, the challenge in understanding the labeling iterations stems from interpreting the intricate relationships between data programming elements, exacerbated by their many-to-many and directed characteristics, inconsistent formats, and the large scale of data typically involved in labeling tasks. These complexities may impede the evaluation of label quality, identification of areas for improvement, and the effective optimization of LFs for acquiring high-quality labeled data. In this article, we introduce EvoVis, a visual analytics method for multi-class text labeling tasks. It seamlessly integrates relationship analysis and temporal overview to display contextual and historical information on a single screen, aiding in explaining the labeling iterations in data programming. We assessed its utility and effectiveness through case studies and user studies. The results indicate that EvoVis can effectively assist data programmers in understanding labeling iterations and improving the quality of labeled data, as evidenced by an increase of 0.16 in the average F1 score when compared to the default analysis tool.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Trends in using deep learning algorithms in biomedical prediction systems', 'abstract': 'In the domain of using DL-based methods in medical and healthcare prediction systems, the utilization of state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) methodologies assumes paramount significance.

Automated synthesis protocol analysis is attractive for swiftly identifying opportunities and informing predictive models, however such applications in heterogeneous catalysis remain limited. In this proof-of-concept, we introduce a transformer model for this task, exemplified using single-atom heterogeneous catalysts (SACs), a rapidly expanding catalyst family. Our model adeptly converts SAC protocols into action sequences, and we use this output to facilitate statistical inference of their synthesis trends and applications, potentially expediting literature review and analysis. We demonstrate the model’s adaptability across distinct heterogeneous catalyst families, underscoring its versatility. Finally, our study highlights a critical issue: the lack of standardization in reporting protocols hampers machine-reading capabilities.

Although AI/ML are relatively new fields, numerous case studies offer substantial evidence of their successful application in predicting AMR outbreaks with greater accuracy. These models can provide insights into the discovery of novel antimicrobials, the repurposing of existing drugs, and combination therapy through the analysis of their molecular structures. In addition, AI-based clinical decision support systems in real-time guide healthcare professionals to improve prescribing of antibiotics. The review also outlines how can AI improve AMR surveillance, analyze resistance trends, and enable early outbreak identification. Challenges, such as ethical considerations, data privacy, and model biases exist, however, the continuous development of novel methodologies enables AI/ML to play a significant role in combating AMR.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Let the Algorithm Speak: How to Use Neural Networks for Automatic Item Generation in Psychological Scale Development', 'abstract': 'Measurement is at the heart of scientific research. As many-perhaps most-psychological constructs cannot be directly observed, there is a steady demand for reliable self-report scales to assess latent constructs. However, scale development is a tedious process that requires researchers to produce good items in large quantities. In this tutorial, we introduce, explain, and apply the Psychometric Item Generator (PIG), an open-source, free-to-use, self-sufficient natural language processing algorithm that produces large-scale, human-like, customized text output within a few mouse clicks. The PIG is based on the GPT-2, a powerful generative language model, and runs on Google Colaboratory-an interactive virtual notebook environment that executes code on state-of-the-art virtual machines at no cost. Across two demonstrations and a preregistered five-pronged empirical validation with two Canadian samples (<i>N</i><sub>Sample 1</sub> = 501, <i>N</i><sub>Sample 2</sub> = 773), we show that the PIG is equally well-suited to generate large pools of face-valid items for novel constructs (i.e., wanderlust) and create parsimonious short scales of existing constructs (i.e., Big Five personality traits) that yield strong performances when tested in the wild and benchmarked against current gold standards for assessment. The PIG does not require any prior coding skills or access to computational resources and can easily be tailored to any desired context by simply switching out short linguistic prompts in a single line of code. In short, we present an effective, novel machine learning solution to an old psychological challenge. As such, the PIG will not require you to learn a new language-but instead, speak yours.

    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem this research cluster addresses is the challenge of generating and ensuring high-quality labeled data to support effective machine learning applications, especially in complex domains requiring domain expertise and iterative refinement. This is underscored by the central nodes focusing on 'high-quality labeled training data', 'labeling functions', 'labeling tasks', and the employment of 'visual analytics methods' to aid this process. The thematic islands reveal three core paradigms: (1) human-in-the-loop data programming and labeling workflows augmented by visual analytics to understand and improve labeling iterations; (2) integration of language models and automated information extraction to accelerate data curation and experimental feedback loops; and (3) the broader application of artificial intelligence and machine learning as foundational technologies for intelligent decision-making and automation. Dominant methods include leveraging large language models for flexible information extraction and hypothesis formulation, visual analytics for interpretable interactions with labeling functions and iterative tasks, and reinforcement or active learning paradigms to optimize data quality efficiently.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite advances, a key limitation is the lack of standardized protocols and interoperable reporting formats (as noted in heterogeneous catalysis synthesis planning), which hampers machine-readability and cross-domain automation. The bridge nodes indicate challenges in coherently linking labeling functions, quality assessment, and visual analytics—highlighting a need for better tools to interpret and optimize labeling iteration cycles. Moreover, while LLMs help automate information extraction and knowledge generation, their integration with human-in-the-loop feedback and iterative hypothesis testing remains underdeveloped, limiting the system's adaptivity and interpretability. External/Novel Gaps: The GPS \"hidden bridges\" suggest overlooked connections between high-quality labeled data and advanced information extraction methods employing semi-supervised learning, pseudo-labeling, and deep active learning mechanisms. For instance, introducing deep active learning strategies with LLM-based data programming could greatly reduce the labeling burden while improving label quality. Another notable gap is the absent synergy between AI-driven decision support systems (from medical/biomedical domains) and interactive hypothesis testing frameworks, which could improve real-time model adaptivity and human-machine collaboration. Additionally, the lack of domain-specific protocol standardization inhibits scalable cross-disciplinary transfer of LLM-driven NLP pipelines, limiting their broader impact.",
