    "title": "Adaptive Multimodal Sensor Fusion for Real-Time Robotic Experiment Control Using Foundation Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Scientific discovery pipelines integrating LLMs with robotic experimentation lack rich and resilient real-time multimodal data integration necessary for scalable autonomous decision-making.",
    "Motivation": "This idea tackles the internal gap related to poor multimodal integration by importing advanced sensor fusion techniques from robotics and signal processing, addressing the second and fourth internal gaps and the second innovation opportunity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multimodal fusion architecture combining raw sensory inputs (chemical sensor arrays, spectroscopy, imaging) using transformer-based encoders conditioned on LLM embeddings. The method incorporates attention mechanisms to weigh sensor streams dynamically based on experimental context and uncertainty estimates. This augmented foundation model guides robotic actuation decisions in an adaptive feedback loop, enabling real-time experiment modification and error recovery with multimodal context.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble multimodal datasets from robotic chemistry labs including sensor streams and experiment logs. 2. Pretrain individual sensor encoders and a multimodal fusion transformer with LLM conditioning. 3. Implement real-time control loop software integrating fused embeddings into decision-making policies. 4. Benchmark performance against unimodal baselines and static fusion techniques on metrics such as experiment throughput, error rate, and adaptive responsiveness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Streaming data of IR spectra, electrochemical sensor readouts, and microscopic images from catalyst synthesis. Output: Timely control commands adjusting temperature and reagent flow; multimodal embedding vectors indicating uncertainty and anomaly detection with textual explanations from LLM.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time fusion causes latency, explore asynchronous sensor processing with event-driven updates. Alternatively, limit fusion to sequential experiments with offline aggregation. Conduct failure mode analysis focusing on sensor noise impact and retrain fusion model with noise-robust loss functions."
