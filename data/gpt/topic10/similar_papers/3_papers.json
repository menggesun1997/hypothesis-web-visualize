    "abstract": "Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies-such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks-to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows-namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity-critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent decision-making (IDM) is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to automate or augment decision processes. Modern IDM paradigms integrate advanced frameworks to enable intelligent agents to make effective and adaptive choices and decompose complex tasks into manageable steps, such as AI agents and high-level reinforcement learning. Recent advances in multimodal foundation-based approaches unify diverse input modalities-such as vision, language, and sensory data-into a cohesive decision-making process. Foundation models (FMs) have become pivotal in science and industry, transforming decision-making and research capabilities. Their large-scale, multimodal data-processing abilities foster adaptability and interdisciplinary breakthroughs across fields such as healthcare, life sciences, and education. This survey examines IDM's evolution, advanced paradigms with FMs and their transformative impact on decision-making across diverse scientific and industrial domains, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in building efficient, adaptive, and ethical decision systems.",

    "abstract": "Environmental health (EH) is a complex and interdisciplinary field dedicated to the examination of environmental behaviours, toxicological effects, health risks, and strategies for mitigating harmful environmental factors. Traditional EH research investigates correlations between risk factors and health outcomes through control variables, but this route is difficult to address complex EH issue. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology not only has accelerated the innovation of the scientific research paradigm but also has become an important tool for solving complex EH problems. However, the in-depth and comprehensive implementation of AI in the field of EH still faces many barriers, such as model generalizability, data privacy protection, algorithm transparency, and regulatory and ethical issues. This review focuses on the compound exposures of EH and explores the potential, challenges, and development directions of AI in four key phases of EH research: (1) data collection, fusion, and management, (2) hazard identification and screening, (3) risk modeling and assessment and (4) EH management. It is not difficult to see that in the future, artificial intelligence technology will inevitably carry out multidimensional simulation of complex exposure factors through multi-mode data fusion, so as to achieve accurate identification of environmental health risks, and eventually become an efficient tool for global environmental health management. This review will help researchers re-examine this strategy and provide a reference for AI to solve complex exposure problems.",

    "abstract": "From accelerating simulations and exploring chemical space, to experimental planning and integrating automation within experimental labs, artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the landscape of chemistry. We are seeing a significant increase in the number of publications leveraging these powerful data-driven insights and models to accelerate all aspects of chemical research. For example, how we represent molecules and materials to computer algorithms for predictive and generative models, as well as the physical mechanisms by which we perform experiments in the lab for automation. Here, we present ten diverse perspectives on the impact of AI coming from those with a range of backgrounds from experimental chemistry, computational chemistry, computer science, engineering and across different areas of chemistry, including drug discovery, catalysis, chemical automation, chemical physics, materials chemistry. The ten perspectives presented here cover a range of themes, including AI for computation, facilitating discovery, supporting experiments, and enabling technologies for transformation. We highlight and discuss imminent challenges and ways in which we are redefining problems to accelerate the impact of chemical research <i>via</i> AI.",

    "title": "Optimized intrusion detection in IoT and fog computing using ensemble learning and advanced feature selection",
    "year": 2024,
    "citationCount": 4,
    "fieldCitationRatio": NaN,
    "abstract": "The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and fog computing architectures has introduced major security and cyber threats. Intrusion detection systems have become effective in monitoring network traffic and activities to identify anomalies that are indicative of attacks. However, constraints such as limited computing resources at fog nodes render conventional intrusion detection techniques impractical. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates stacked autoencoders, CatBoost, and an optimised transformer-CNN-LSTM ensemble tailored for intrusion detection in fog and IoT networks. Autoencoders extract robust features from high-dimensional traffic data while reducing the dimensionality of the efficiency at fog nodes. CatBoost refines features through predictive selection. The ensemble model combines self-attention, convolutions, and recurrence for comprehensive traffic analysis in the cloud. Evaluations of the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and AWID benchmarks demonstrate an accuracy of over 99% in detecting threats across traditional, hybrid enterprises and wireless environments. Integrated edge preprocessing and cloud-based ensemble learning pipelines enable efficient and accurate anomaly detection. The results highlight the viability of securing real-world fog and the IoT infrastructure against continuously evolving cyber-attacks.",

    "abstract": "Engineered materials are ubiquitous throughout society and are critical to the development of modern technology, yet many current material systems are inexorably tied to widespread deterioration of ecological processes. Next-generation material systems can address goals of environmental sustainability by providing alternatives to fossil fuel-based materials and by reducing destructive extraction processes, energy costs, and accumulation of solid waste. However, development of sustainable materials faces several key challenges including investigation, processing, and architecting of new feedstocks that are often relatively mechanically weak, complex, and difficult to characterize or standardize. In this review paper, we outline a framework for examining sustainability in material systems and discuss how recent developments in modeling, machine learning, and other computational tools can aid the discovery of novel sustainable materials. We consider these through the lens of materiomics, an approach that considers material systems holistically by incorporating perspectives of all relevant scales, beginning with first-principles approaches and extending through the macroscale to consider sustainable material design from the bottom-up. We follow with an examination of how computational methods are currently applied to select examples of sustainable material development, with particular emphasis on bioinspired and biobased materials, and conclude with perspectives on opportunities and open challenges.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a rapid increase in digital medicine research in an attempt to transform traditional healthcare systems to their modern, intelligent, and versatile equivalents that are adequately equipped to tackle contemporary challenges. This has led to a wave of applications that utilise AI technologies; first and foremost in the fields of medical imaging, but also in the use of wearables and other intelligent sensors. In comparison, computer audition can be seen to be lagging behind, at least in terms of commercial interest. Yet, audition has long been a staple assistant for medical practitioners, with the stethoscope being the quintessential sign of doctors around the world. Transforming this traditional technology with the use of AI entails a set of unique challenges. We categorise the advances needed in four key pillars: Hear, corresponding to the cornerstone technologies needed to analyse auditory signals in real-life conditions; Earlier, for the advances needed in computational and data efficiency; Attentively, for accounting to individual differences and handling the longitudinal nature of medical data; and, finally, Responsibly, for ensuring compliance to the ethical standards accorded to the field of medicine. Thus, we provide an overview and perspective of HEAR4Health: the sketch of a modern, ubiquitous sensing system that can bring computer audition on par with other AI technologies in the strive for improved healthcare systems.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning is increasingly being applied in polymer chemistry to link chemical structures to macroscopic properties of polymers and to identify chemical patterns in the polymer structures that help improve specific properties. To facilitate this, a chemical dataset needs to be translated into machine readable descriptors. However, limited and inadequately curated datasets, broad molecular weight distributions, and irregular polymer configurations pose significant challenges. Most off the shelf mathematical models often need refinement for specific applications. Addressing these challenges demand a close collaboration between chemists and mathematicians as chemists must formulate research questions in mathematical terms while mathematicians are required to refine models for specific applications. This review unites both disciplines to address dataset curation hurdles and highlight advances in polymer synthesis and modeling that enhance data availability. It then surveys ML approaches used to predict solid-state properties, solution behavior, composite performance, and emerging applications such as drug delivery and the polymer-biology interface. A perspective of the field is concluded and the importance of FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) data and the integration of polymer theory and data are discussed, and the thoughts on the machine-human interface are shared.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) coupled with promising machine learning (ML) techniques well known from computer science is broadly affecting many aspects of various fields including science and technology, industry, and even our day-to-day life. The ML techniques have been developed to analyze high-throughput data with a view to obtaining useful insights, categorizing, predicting, and making evidence-based decisions in novel ways, which will promote the growth of novel applications and fuel the sustainable booming of AI. This paper undertakes a comprehensive survey on the development and application of AI in different aspects of fundamental sciences, including information science, mathematics, medical science, materials science, geoscience, life science, physics, and chemistry. The challenges that each discipline of science meets, and the potentials of AI techniques to handle these challenges, are discussed in detail. Moreover, we shed light on new research trends entailing the integration of AI into each scientific discipline. The aim of this paper is to provide a broad research guideline on fundamental sciences with potential infusion of AI, to help motivate researchers to deeply understand the state-of-the-art applications of AI-based fundamental sciences, and thereby to help promote the continuous development of these fundamental sciences.",

    "abstract": "Cultured meat has the potential to provide a complementary meat industry with reduced environmental, ethical, and health impacts. However, major technological challenges remain which require time-and resource-intensive research and development efforts. Machine learning has the potential to accelerate cultured meat technology by streamlining experiments, predicting optimal results, and reducing experimentation time and resources. However, the use of machine learning in cultured meat is in its infancy. This review covers the work available to date on the use of machine learning in cultured meat and explores future possibilities. We address four major areas of cultured meat research and development: establishing cell lines, cell culture media design, microscopy and image analysis, and bioprocessing and food processing optimization. In addition, we have included a survey of datasets relevant to CM research. This review aims to provide the foundation necessary for both cultured meat and machine learning scientists to identify research opportunities at the intersection between cultured meat and machine learning.",
