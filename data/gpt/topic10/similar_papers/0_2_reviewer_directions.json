    "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Social AI Framework for Enhanced Collaboration in IDM Pipelines",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current IDM workflows employing LLMs lack nuanced contextual awareness and do not adequately support human-AI collaboration, limiting operational scalability in real-world settings.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses external novel gaps in integrating social and behavioral science models to enhance human-centered AI, directly responding to the third innovation opportunity and operationalization challenges seen in urban digital twins and material design research.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a socio-cognitive AI system embedding social interaction models and behavioral analytics within the LLM-augmented pipeline. The system will model human collaborator preferences, cognitive load, and communication styles to adapt AI outputs and decision suggestions accordingly. Incorporates a conversational agent that mediates between LLM knowledge synthesis and human input with real-time sentiment and engagement analysis to optimize collaboration efficacy.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop datasets pairing human-expert interaction transcripts with IDM pipeline data. 2. Train social-behavioral context modules using multimodal cues (e.g., text, voice, facial expression). 3. Integrate modules with LLM-driven IDM pipelines and deploy within lab environments. 4. Evaluate improvements in decision accuracy, user satisfaction, trust, and throughput compared to standard pipelines without human-AI social modeling.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Human expert queries about experimental design preferences and risk tolerance. Output: AI recommendations tailored with justifications framed in a manner matching the collaborator’s communication style and cognitive state; alerts for potential misunderstandings or decision conflicts.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If social modeling proves too complex, implement delayed feedback mechanisms allowing iterative refinement of user preferences. Alternatively, deploy minimal viable product targeting only sentiment-adapted response generation within existing LLM interfaces. Conduct user studies to identify key behavioral predictors for further refinement."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed socio-cognitive AI framework integrating social interaction models and behavioral analytics within LLM-augmented IDM pipelines is compelling, the mechanism of how these models dynamically adapt AI outputs based on nuanced human factors like cognitive load and communication styles lacks clarity. The framework should explicitly describe the model architectures, interaction protocols, and algorithms, especially how real-time sentiment and engagement analyses influence AI decision outputs and modifications in collaboration flow. Clarifying these details will strengthen the theoretical foundation and reproducibility of the approach, thereby increasing confidence in soundness and practical utility, which is crucial given the complexity of social behavior modeling within AI pipelines. Consider including specific model types or referencing prior works bridging social signal processing with LLM outputs in human-in-the-loop contexts to fortify this aspect rigorously and concretely in Proposed_Method section."

          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screening novelty classification as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the existing active research on human-AI collaboration frameworks, enhancing the idea’s distinctive value through integration with globally relevant, impactful domains is advised. Specifically, leveraging concepts like 'Building Information Modeling (BIM)' and 'AI paradigm' from the provided globally-linked concepts could broaden and deepen the impact. For example, proposing an extension of the social AI framework tailored for IDM-related decision-making in smart cities or urban planning via BIM-enhanced digital twins would situate the research at the intersection of social AI and a high-impact domain that demands scalable human-AI collaboration. This cross-domain connection would increase the potential for real-world application and novelty by explicitly addressing operationalization challenges in large-scale infrastructure or material design workflows, aligning well with the stated motivation. Incorporate this global integration suggestion to strengthen both novelty and impact in the final proposal."
