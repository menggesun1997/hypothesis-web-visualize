    "title": "Graph-Guided Optimization of Labeling Iteration Cycles via Multi-View Analytics",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current workflows insufficiently capture and optimize the complex interdependencies among labeling functions, quality metrics, and visual analytics, hindering efficient cycle improvements.",
    "Motivation": "This directly addresses the internal gap of limited coherent linking between labeling functions, quality assessment, and interactive visualization to interpret and optimize iterative labeling workflows.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a multi-view graph representation modeling entities such as labeling functions, data samples, annotation errors, and quality scores, integrated into a visual analytics system. Implement graph analytics techniques—community detection, edge bundling, and temporal analysis—to identify bottlenecks and opportunities for optimizing iterative labeling. The system recommends labeling function updates and sample prioritization based on discovered structural patterns.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Create graph datasets from recorded labeling iterations on benchmark NLP datasets. 2) Develop graph construction pipeline to encode labeling conditions and quality metrics. 3) Integrate with visual analytics interface for user interaction and recommendation delivery. 4) Conduct user experiments comparing labeling efficiency with and without graph-guided suggestions. 5) Metrics: annotation time reduction, label accuracy, user cognitive load.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Data on labeling tasks with observed errors and function overlaps represented as nodes and edges. Output: Visualization highlighting clusters of problematic labeling functions and samples, with recommended actions. Result: users apply suggestions to improve labeling function definitions, reducing errors in subsequent cycles.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If graph complexity hinders interpretability, implement filtering and focus+context techniques to reduce visual clutter. Alternatively, simplify the graph model by focusing only on highest-impact labeling functions or samples with critical quality issues."
