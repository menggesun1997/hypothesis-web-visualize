    "title": "Cross-Disciplinary LLM-Powered Adherence Support System Integrating Psychiatric Nursing and EHR Interfaces",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of integrated adherence support systems combining psychiatric nursing best practices with electronic health record functionalities limits effective patient engagement and treatment adherence in mental health care.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external hidden bridge gap between patient engagement, psychiatric nursing, and EHR by synthesizing these domains into AI-driven adherence interventions embedded within clinical workflows. The novel contribution is a human-centric, AI-augmented adherence support platform contextualized by psychiatric nursing insights.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an AI platform combining LLMs trained on psychiatric nursing literature, clinical care pathways, and EHR metadata to provide personalized adherence recommendations and reminders. The system leverages patient portal interactions, nurse-generated annotations, and real-time clinical notes to dynamically adapt support messages. It includes feedback loops for nurses to review AI interventions and adjust guidance, enabling continuous improvement and ethical oversight.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Aggregate psychiatric nursing guidelines, EHR data, and patient portal logs.\n2. Train LLMs for adherence recommendation generation.\n3. Implement interfaces for nursing review and feedback.\n4. Conduct pilot studies in psychiatric clinics measuring adherence improvement and acceptability.\n5. Evaluate using adherence rates, user satisfaction, and bias audits.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient with a history of sporadic medication adherence and notes from nurses indicating barriers.\nOutput: Tailored reminder schedules, motivational messages, and scheduling of nurse follow-ups via portal integration, all compliant with ethical standards and culturally sensitive.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If nurse feedback is limited, incorporate passive monitoring from portal usage data. If real-time adaptation is hard, deploy static protocol-based adherence support modules."

        "title": "Integrated AI-Driven Psychiatric Adherence Support Platform with Multimodal Data Fusion and Clinical Decision Support Alignment",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current mental health adherence support systems lack a robust integration of heterogeneous data sources—including psychiatric nursing insights, EHR metadata, patient portal interactions, and nurse annotations—with real-time adaptive AI recommendations. This gap limits effective, safe, and contextually sensitive patient engagement and treatment adherence, as well as clinician trust and workflow integration.",
        "Motivation": "While AI interventions for mental health adherence exist, their novelty and impact remain limited by under-specified mechanisms for multi-source data fusion, insufficient alignment with mature clinical decision support system (CDSS) frameworks, and narrow focus excluding holistic factors such as nutrition. This work advances the state-of-the-art by proposing a transparent, multimodal, LLM-augmented adherence platform that unites psychiatric nursing expertise, EHR data, portal usage, and nutritional adherence considerations into a unified model. By embedding CDSS best practices, it prioritizes interpretability, clinician trust, and ethical safety, thus closing the implementation and novelty gaps of prior systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular AI adherence support platform employing a hybrid architecture combining multimodal representation learning and rule-based decision logic. (1) Data Fusion: Develop domain-adapted embedding models to harmonize heterogeneous inputs from psychiatric nursing literature, EHR metadata (structured and unstructured), patient portal logs, nurse annotations, and nutritional adherence markers sourced from dietary self-reports and International Union of Nutritional Sciences guidelines. (2) Model Architecture: Utilize a multimodal transformer backbone to fuse these embeddings and generate personalized adherence recommendations and reminders contextualized to clinical state and patient preferences. (3) CDSS Integration: Implement explicit rule-based components grounded in clinical protocols and ethical guardrails to complement LLM outputs, ensuring transparency and safety. (4) Nurse Review & Feedback Loops: Create interactive interfaces allowing nursing staff to inspect model rationale, adjust intervention parameters, and curate culturally sensitive communications. (5) Real-Time Adaptation: Continuously update recommendations leveraging streaming data with uncertainty estimation to handle noise and clinical workflow diversity. This design enhances interpretability, reliability, and trustworthiness necessary for psychiatric care adherence support and sets our approach apart by combining AI, CDSS frameworks, and nutritional science in a human-centered system.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Acquisition & Preparation: Secure access to de-identified psychiatric EHR datasets and patient portal logs from partner psychiatric clinics, targeting at least 500 patients; obtain psychiatric nursing guidelines and validated nutritional psychiatry datasets per ethical and regulatory protocols. 2. Multimodal Model Development: Train and validate domain-adapted multimodal transformers incorporating embeddings of clinical notes, nursing annotations, portal metadata, and nutritional markers; iteratively test embedding alignment and rule-based CDSS logic for coverage and interpretability. 3. Interface Implementation: Develop nurse-facing review tools integrating explanation visualizations and adjustable intervention controls; conduct usability testing with clinical nursing staff. 4. Pilot Deployment: Conduct a controlled pilot in 2 psychiatric clinics over 6 months, enrolling ~100 patients receiving AI-powered adherence support versus matched controls receiving standard care. 5. Evaluation Metrics: Measure medication and therapy adherence rates via EHR records, patient engagement on portals, nurse intervention acceptability (validated surveys), and fairness/bias audits on AI outputs. 6. Iterative Refinement: Integrate nurse feedback and pilot data for model tuning and fallback protocols. 7. Regulatory & Ethical Oversight: Obtain IRB approval, conduct risk assessments, and ensure compliance throughout. Clear criteria for success include statistically significant adherence improvement and high clinician trust scores. Contingency pathways include enhanced rule-based fallback modules if nurse feedback is limited or real-time adaptation yields unreliable predictions.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient with fluctuating medication adherence, EHR clinical notes indicating depressive episode severity changes, nurse annotations identifying socioeconomic stressors, portal log showing sporadic login patterns, and dietary self-reports signaling inconsistent nutritional intake. Output: An integrated adherence support message schedule blending motivational reminders, nurse-suggested follow-ups, dietary guidance aligned with International Union of Nutritional Sciences standards, and alerts routed through the CDSS-aligned interface. The message content is adaptively personalized, culturally sensitive, and accompanied by nurse-explainable rationales ensuring ethical compliance and fostering therapeutic alliance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should nurse feedback prove limited, the platform will progressively emphasize passive adherence indicators from portal metadata and EHR behavioral markers to sustain intervention personalization without active annotations. If real-time dynamic adaptation poses challenges due to data noise or workflow heterogeneity, we will deploy robust static protocol-based support modules incorporating CDSS rule sets, with fallback alerts to nursing staff for manual intervention, thereby preserving adherence support continuity alongside ongoing system refinement."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section outlines a promising AI-driven platform leveraging LLMs and psychiatric nursing insights. However, the actual mechanism for integrating multi-source data (psychiatric nursing literature, EHR metadata, patient portal logs, nurse annotations) and dynamically adapting support messages remains underspecified. It is unclear how the LLM will effectively merge heterogeneous inputs and contextualize recommendations in real time, especially given challenges like noisy data, diverse clinical workflows, and ethical considerations. Clarifying the model architecture, data fusion strategy, and decision logic is essential to demonstrate soundness of the mechanism and build confidence in reliability and safety of the generated adherence interventions. Consider specifying whether the approach involves multimodal representation learning, domain adaptation, or rule-based components complementing the LLM outputs to address complexity and maintain interpretability for nurse review loops. This clarity will improve trust, reproducibility, and facilitate effective implementation within clinical workflows for psychiatric care adherence support. This point is critical for the innovator to address first to validate the foundational technical feasibility and clinical applicability of the system before proceeding to experiments or scaling impact ambitions.\n\n"

For example, the plan should specify data volume, quality, and access strategies for aggregating psychiatric nursing guidelines and EHR data, which are known to have stringent privacy and interoperability constraints. It also omits discussion on how to recruit pilot clinics, handle potential ethical and regulatory approvals, and which quantitative and qualitative adherence metrics will be used beyond general 'user satisfaction' and 'bias audits.' Furthermore, contingency strategies for dealing with limited nurse feedback or real-time adaptation challenges are stated but could be better integrated into iterative experiment design to ensure robust validation. Strengthening experimental protocols, defining clear success criteria, controls or baselines, and outlining risk mitigation for data and deployment challenges are essential. Delivering a detailed and scientifically rigorous experiment plan is pivotal for the innovator to establish the proposed system's viability and clinical impact in real-world mental health environments.\n\n"

Specifically, aligning the AI adherence recommendations with CDSS frameworks could improve interpretability, safety, and clinician trust. Additionally, exploring nutritional psychiatry interventions might be informative, as the International Union of Nutritional Sciences focuses on nutritional impacts on health, and integrating dietary adherence support could enrich patient engagement and holistic care strategies. Suggest expanding the platform's scope to include multimodal adherence factors and extending collaboration with CDSS experts and nutritional science frameworks to create a truly cross-disciplinary, comprehensive adherence system that elevates both innovation and real-world applicability."
