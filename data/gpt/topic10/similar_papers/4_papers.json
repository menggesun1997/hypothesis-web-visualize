    "abstract": "Intelligent decision-making (IDM) is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to automate or augment decision processes. Modern IDM paradigms integrate advanced frameworks to enable intelligent agents to make effective and adaptive choices and decompose complex tasks into manageable steps, such as AI agents and high-level reinforcement learning. Recent advances in multimodal foundation-based approaches unify diverse input modalities-such as vision, language, and sensory data-into a cohesive decision-making process. Foundation models (FMs) have become pivotal in science and industry, transforming decision-making and research capabilities. Their large-scale, multimodal data-processing abilities foster adaptability and interdisciplinary breakthroughs across fields such as healthcare, life sciences, and education. This survey examines IDM's evolution, advanced paradigms with FMs and their transformative impact on decision-making across diverse scientific and industrial domains, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in building efficient, adaptive, and ethical decision systems.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and automation are transforming catalyst discovery and design from traditional trial-and-error manual mode into intelligent, high-throughput digital methodologies. This transformation is driven by four key components, including high-throughput information extraction, automated robotic experimentation, real-time feedback for iterative optimization, and interpretable machine learning for generating new knowledge. These innovations have given rise to the development of self-driving labs and significantly accelerated materials research. Over the past two years, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has added a new dimension to this field, providing unprecedented flexibility in information integration, decision-making, and interacting with human researchers. This review explores how LLMs are reshaping catalyst design, heralding a revolutionary change in the fields.",

    "year": 2025,
    "citationCount": 3,
    "fieldCitationRatio": NaN,
    "abstract": "Obtaining high-quality labeled training data poses a significant bottleneck in the domain of machine learning. Data programming has emerged as a new paradigm to address this issue by converting human knowledge into labeling functions (LFs) to quickly produce low-cost probabilistic labels. To ensure the quality of labeled data, data programmers commonly iterate LFs for many rounds until satisfactory performance is achieved. However, the challenge in understanding the labeling iterations stems from interpreting the intricate relationships between data programming elements, exacerbated by their many-to-many and directed characteristics, inconsistent formats, and the large scale of data typically involved in labeling tasks. These complexities may impede the evaluation of label quality, identification of areas for improvement, and the effective optimization of LFs for acquiring high-quality labeled data. In this article, we introduce EvoVis, a visual analytics method for multi-class text labeling tasks. It seamlessly integrates relationship analysis and temporal overview to display contextual and historical information on a single screen, aiding in explaining the labeling iterations in data programming. We assessed its utility and effectiveness through case studies and user studies. The results indicate that EvoVis can effectively assist data programmers in understanding labeling iterations and improving the quality of labeled data, as evidenced by an increase of 0.16 in the average F1 score when compared to the default analysis tool.",

    "abstract": "In the domain of using DL-based methods in medical and healthcare prediction systems, the utilization of state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) methodologies assumes paramount significance. DL has attained remarkable achievements across diverse domains, rendering its efficacy particularly noteworthy in this context. The integration of DL with health and medical prediction systems enables real-time analysis of vast and intricate datasets, yielding insights that significantly enhance healthcare outcomes and operational efficiency in the industry. This comprehensive literature review systematically investigates the latest DL solutions for the challenges encountered in medical healthcare, with a specific emphasis on DL applications in the medical domain. By categorizing cutting-edge DL approaches into distinct categories, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), long short-term memory (LSTM) models, support vector machine (SVM), and hybrid models, this study delves into their underlying principles, merits, limitations, methodologies, simulation environments, and datasets. Notably, the majority of the scrutinized articles were published in 2022, underscoring the contemporaneous nature of the research. Moreover, this review accentuates the forefront advancements in DL techniques and their practical applications within the realm of medical prediction systems, while simultaneously addressing the challenges that hinder the widespread implementation of DL in image segmentation within the medical healthcare domains. These discerned insights serve as compelling impetuses for future studies aimed at the progressive advancement of using DL-based methods in medical and health prediction systems. The evaluation metrics employed across the reviewed articles encompass a broad spectrum of features, encompassing accuracy, precision, specificity, F-score, adoptability, adaptability, and scalability.",

In this proof-of-concept, we introduce a transformer model for this task, exemplified using single-atom heterogeneous catalysts (SACs), a rapidly expanding catalyst family. Our model adeptly converts SAC protocols into action sequences, and we use this output to facilitate statistical inference of their synthesis trends and applications, potentially expediting literature review and analysis. We demonstrate the model’s adaptability across distinct heterogeneous catalyst families, underscoring its versatility. Finally, our study highlights a critical issue: the lack of standardization in reporting protocols hampers machine-reading capabilities. Embracing digital advances in catalysis demands a shift in data reporting norms, and to this end, we offer guidelines for writing protocols, significantly improving machine-readability. We release our model as an open-source web application, inviting a fresh approach to accelerate heterogeneous catalysis synthesis planning.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to global public health. The current review synthesizes to address the possible role of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) in mitigating AMR. Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing are some of the main tools used in this domain. AI/ML models can use various data sources, such as clinical information, genomic sequences, microbiome insights, and epidemiological data for predicting AMR outbreaks. Although AI/ML are relatively new fields, numerous case studies offer substantial evidence of their successful application in predicting AMR outbreaks with greater accuracy. These models can provide insights into the discovery of novel antimicrobials, the repurposing of existing drugs, and combination therapy through the analysis of their molecular structures. In addition, AI-based clinical decision support systems in real-time guide healthcare professionals to improve prescribing of antibiotics. The review also outlines how can AI improve AMR surveillance, analyze resistance trends, and enable early outbreak identification. Challenges, such as ethical considerations, data privacy, and model biases exist, however, the continuous development of novel methodologies enables AI/ML to play a significant role in combating AMR.",

    "abstract": "Measurement is at the heart of scientific research. As many-perhaps most-psychological constructs cannot be directly observed, there is a steady demand for reliable self-report scales to assess latent constructs. However, scale development is a tedious process that requires researchers to produce good items in large quantities. In this tutorial, we introduce, explain, and apply the Psychometric Item Generator (PIG), an open-source, free-to-use, self-sufficient natural language processing algorithm that produces large-scale, human-like, customized text output within a few mouse clicks. The PIG is based on the GPT-2, a powerful generative language model, and runs on Google Colaboratory-an interactive virtual notebook environment that executes code on state-of-the-art virtual machines at no cost. Across two demonstrations and a preregistered five-pronged empirical validation with two Canadian samples (<i>N</i><sub>Sample 1</sub> = 501, <i>N</i><sub>Sample 2</sub> = 773), we show that the PIG is equally well-suited to generate large pools of face-valid items for novel constructs (i.e., wanderlust) and create parsimonious short scales of existing constructs (i.e., Big Five personality traits) that yield strong performances when tested in the wild and benchmarked against current gold standards for assessment. The PIG does not require any prior coding skills or access to computational resources and can easily be tailored to any desired context by simply switching out short linguistic prompts in a single line of code. In short, we present an effective, novel machine learning solution to an old psychological challenge. As such, the PIG will not require you to learn a new language-but instead, speak yours.
