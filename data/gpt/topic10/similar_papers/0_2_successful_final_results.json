    "Problem_Statement": "Current IDM workflows employing LLMs lack nuanced contextual awareness and do not adequately support human-AI collaboration, limiting operational scalability in real-world settings.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses external novel gaps in integrating social and behavioral science models to enhance human-centered AI, directly responding to the third innovation opportunity and operationalization challenges seen in urban digital twins and material design research.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a socio-cognitive AI system embedding social interaction models and behavioral analytics within the LLM-augmented pipeline. The system will model human collaborator preferences, cognitive load, and communication styles to adapt AI outputs and decision suggestions accordingly. Incorporates a conversational agent that mediates between LLM knowledge synthesis and human input with real-time sentiment and engagement analysis to optimize collaboration efficacy.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop datasets pairing human-expert interaction transcripts with IDM pipeline data. 2. Train social-behavioral context modules using multimodal cues (e.g., text, voice, facial expression). 3. Integrate modules with LLM-driven IDM pipelines and deploy within lab environments. 4. Evaluate improvements in decision accuracy, user satisfaction, trust, and throughput compared to standard pipelines without human-AI social modeling.",

        "title": "Dynamically Adaptive Human-in-the-Loop Social AI Framework Integrated with BIM for Enhanced Decision-Making in IDM Pipelines",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current IDM workflows employing large language models (LLMs) and AI systems lack explicit mechanisms to dynamically incorporate nuanced human factors such as cognitive load, communication styles, and engagement in real time. This limits the efficacy and scalability of human-AI collaboration in complex, large-scale operational domains like smart city planning and urban infrastructure management. Moreover, existing frameworks rarely integrate these socio-cognitive mechanisms with domain-specific digital infrastructures such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), essential for operationalizing decision-making in built environment projects and urban digital twins.",
        "Motivation": "Although many human-AI collaboration frameworks exist, few explicitly model and adapt to real-time socio-cognitive human factors with rigorous computational mechanisms, especially within IDM pipelines augmented by LLMs. The proposed research advances beyond NOV-COMPETITIVE standards by tightly coupling social signal processing and behavioral analytics within AI-driven IDM workflows and grounding the framework in BIM-enhanced digital twin environments for smart cities and urban planning. This fusion addresses a critical gap: enabling scalable, context-aware, and adaptive human-AI decision collaboration in high-impact global domains such as infrastructure management and material design workflows. It leverages emerging AI paradigms and socially-aware AI systems to pioneer operationalization that enhances trust, decision accuracy, and workflow throughput at scale.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a socio-cognitive AI framework that integrates: (1) Multi-modal social signal processing modules—incorporating transformer-based models for sentiment analysis, vocal tone recognition, and facial expression embeddings—that continuously infer collaborator cognitive load, engagement, and communication styles; (2) A dynamic adaptation layer employing Reinforcement Learning and Bayesian preference models that modulate LLM-generated IDM pipeline outputs in real time, tailoring recommendations and explanations to inferred human states; (3) Interaction protocols specifying bi-directional conversational flows between the AI agent and human collaborators, orchestrated via a hierarchical dialogue manager optimized for conflict detection, clarification requests, and adaptive pacing; (4) A BIM-augmented IDM decision context, whereby BIM data structures from smart city digital twins interface through API layers with the AI system to ground human-AI exchanges in domain-specific models, coordinates, and operational constraints. This architecture enables precise reasoning over infrastructure assets, material inventories, and spatial-temporal deployment scenarios, significantly enhancing relevance and operational impact compared to generic IDM pipelines. We build on prior works in social signal processing in HCI and human-in-the-loop RL while extending LLM capabilities through fine-tuning conditioned on behavioral analytics. Open AI frameworks and BIM standards (e.g., IFC) will be leveraged to ensure interoperability and reproducibility.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate and annotate a multi-modal dataset pairing expert IDM collaborative sessions (text, voice, video) with matched BIM-enabled decision contexts from smart city and material design scenarios. 2. Develop and validate transformer-based social-behavioral inference modules for real-time estimation of cognitive load, sentiment, and communication style features, comparing performance with state-of-the-art social signal models. 3. Implement the dynamic adaptation layer integrating these human factors with LLM output modulation, using Reinforcement Learning to optimize for collaboration quality metrics. 4. Integrate the socio-cognitive AI modules with BIM data interfaces to establish a domain-grounded human-AI collaboration pipeline. 5. Deploy the system in controlled lab environments simulating smart city planning workflows and material design IDM pipelines. 6. Evaluate improvements in decision accuracy, throughput, user trust, collaboration satisfaction, and conflict resolution speed against standard IDM-LMM workflows without social adaptation or BIM integration. 7. Conduct ablation studies to ascertain contributions of social modeling and BIM-enhanced context separately and in combination.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A human expert queries the system about risk tradeoffs and urban infrastructure material choices during a digital twin-based building renovation project. The system analyzes vocal tone indicating increased stress and facial microexpressions suggesting cognitive overload, detecting this in real-time. Output: The AI generates tailored, simplified explanations and alternative design suggestions framed using the expert's preferred communication style inferred from prior interactions. It also flags a potential decision conflict by referencing BIM-based spatial constraints and prompts for clarification via a conversational agent. This exchange adaptively modulates pacing and detail level, enhancing mutual understanding and accelerating consensus.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If fully dynamic social modeling proves computationally prohibitive, we will simplify by implementing batch behavioral analytics post-interaction to iteratively refine user preference models offline and apply them adaptively in subsequent sessions. Alternatively, focus on sentiment-adapted response generation leveraging pretrained affective language models with minimal behavioral inputs. BIM integration could be initially limited to static data querying rather than full real-time interfacing. User studies will guide prioritization of social features impacting collaboration most to ensure practical benefits even at intermediate implementation stages."

The framework should explicitly describe the model architectures, interaction protocols, and algorithms, especially how real-time sentiment and engagement analyses influence AI decision outputs and modifications in collaboration flow. Clarifying these details will strengthen the theoretical foundation and reproducibility of the approach, thereby increasing confidence in soundness and practical utility, which is crucial given the complexity of social behavior modeling within AI pipelines. Consider including specific model types or referencing prior works bridging social signal processing with LLM outputs in human-in-the-loop contexts to fortify this aspect rigorously and concretely in Proposed_Method section."

          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screening novelty classification as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the existing active research on human-AI collaboration frameworks, enhancing the idea’s distinctive value through integration with globally relevant, impactful domains is advised. Specifically, leveraging concepts like 'Building Information Modeling (BIM)' and 'AI paradigm' from the provided globally-linked concepts could broaden and deepen the impact. For example, proposing an extension of the social AI framework tailored for IDM-related decision-making in smart cities or urban planning via BIM-enhanced digital twins would situate the research at the intersection of social AI and a high-impact domain that demands scalable human-AI collaboration. This cross-domain connection would increase the potential for real-world application and novelty by explicitly addressing operationalization challenges in large-scale infrastructure or material design workflows, aligning well with the stated motivation. Incorporate this global integration suggestion to strengthen both novelty and impact in the final proposal."
