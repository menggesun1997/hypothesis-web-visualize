    "title": "Multi-Modal Foundation Model Decision Paradigms for Context-Aware Community Well-Being Recommendations",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing social media recommendation algorithms heavily optimize for engagement metrics, neglecting adaptive promotion of community-specific well-being goals and expert oversight, resulting in potential social harms and reduced collective health.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the critical gap of insufficient integration of multi-modal foundation model decision-making paradigms in social media, this project expands on Opportunity 3 to move beyond engagement toward context-aware, ethically guided recommendation frameworks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-modal foundation model framework combining text, image, and social graph data into a unified representation. Employ an adaptive decision-making layer guided by expert-curated well-being objectives per community context, using constrained optimization and reinforcement learning to balance engagement with ethical goals. Integrate expert-in-the-loop feedback cycles for continual adjustment and validation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Aggregate multi-modal social media datasets labeled by community demographics and well-being indicators. 2. Pretrain multi-modal foundation models with aligned embeddings. 3. Formulate decision policies integrating community-specific constraints and well-being metrics. 4. Benchmark against engagement-maximizing recommenders on metrics including content diversity, well-being scores, and ethical compliance. 5. Conduct expert panel reviews alongside user studies for qualitative validation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A social media group exhibiting rising anxiety posts. Expected Output: Recommendations shift to calming, positive content identified via multi-modal signals, validated by experts and correlated with improved group sentiment over time.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-modal fusion underperforms, prioritize single-modality incremental improvements and increase expert feedback frequency. Utilize simplified ethical constraint proxies and more interpretable models."
