    "title": "GPT-Onto-CAABAC: Adaptive Context-Aware Access Control Leveraging LLM Ontologies in Mental Healthcare",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing attribute-based access control frameworks for electronic health records lack dynamic, context-aware adaptability informed by psychiatric research insights and fail to integrate LLM-driven ontology management, limiting ethical compliance and bias mitigation in mental health applications.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap identifying immature integrative frameworks linking ethical access control and AI application themes via the generative pretrained transformer bridge. Also leverages external hidden bridges connecting psychiatric research and EHR with person-centered mental healthcare needs. This project proposes unifying ontology-enhanced LLM access models for adaptive, ethical data governance.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design and implement GPT-Onto-CAABAC, a novel AI-driven access control model that dynamically infers patient context (clinical status, psychiatric screening outcomes) using LLM-based ontologies. Integrate multi-modal EHR data and psychiatric nursing inputs to form semantic ontologies that guide fine-grained access decisions. The system will learn from audit logs to adapt policies respecting patient privacy preferences while maintaining care quality, with bias mitigation modules controlling for discriminatory access patterns.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop psychiatric and EHR ontologies using expert-curated datasets.\n2. Implement LLM modules that generate access control decisions based on ontology reasoning.\n3. Deploy in simulated EHR environment with synthetic patient profiles reflecting diverse mental health states.\n4. Evaluate policy adaptability, bias reduction (disparate impact measures), and care effectiveness.\n5. Test with real-world longitudinal data where feasible, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Request by a clinician to access mental health screening data for a patient flagged as high risk.\nOutput: Access granted with conditions limiting downstream data sharing, accompanied by an audit trail and real-time bias assessment ensuring no unnecessary exposure to non-essential staff.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If ontology complexity hinders real-time performance, fallback on rule-based hybrid models with precompiled LLM policy suggestions. Alternatively, reduce context features to core elements and progressively reintroduce complexity."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section describes a complex system leveraging LLM-based ontologies for fine-grained, adaptive access control informed by psychiatric context and audit logs. However, the mechanistic details of how LLM reasoning integrates with ontology structures to derive real-time access decisions remain unclear. Clarify how ontology reasoning pipelines and LLM outputs interact to ensure both accuracy and computational tractability, including how bias mitigation is operationalized within this pipeline. Consider specifying the architecture modules and data flow in more explicit terms to increase confidence in system soundness and interpretability by stakeholders in healthcare contexts, where transparency is essential for ethical compliance and trustworthiness, especially given the sensitive mental health data domain. This clarity will also support downstream feasibility and evaluation steps by making underlying assumptions explicit and testable, thus strengthening the submission's technical rigor and reproducibility potential while addressing core feasibility concerns emerging from system complexity and real-time constraints noted implicitly in the fallback plan section. Target this to the Proposed_Method section specifically for maximal effect and clarity in the core technical approach description without diluting the high-level innovative framing already present, ensuring reviewers and practitioners understand the novelty and practical innovation beyond conceptual framing alone.

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan ambitiously outlines creation and deployment of ontologies, LLM inference modules, simulations, and real-world longitudinal testing. However, critical feasibility challenges are under-addressed, such as the availability and quality of expert-curated psychiatric datasets for ontology construction, which are notoriously difficult to acquire, and the challenges in synthetic data realism for simulating diverse mental health states. Moreover, the plan would benefit from including interim validation milestones confirming effective ontology accuracy, LLM decision consistency, and bias mitigation efficacy before progressing to deployment and real longitudinal data testing. Ethical and regulatory compliance mechanisms and privacy-preserving techniques in real data tests, such as differential privacy or federated learning, are not sufficiently delineated. Strengthen this section by detailing concrete criteria for success at each step, expected challenges, risk mitigation strategies, and a clearer audit methodology, especially in bias assessment metrics and adaptation feedback loops from audit logs. This will improve overall confidence in the projectâ€™s practical execution in a complex clinical environment, making the pathway from theoretical innovation to deployed solution much more convincing. Focus specifically on the Experiment_Plan section for actionable refinement that aligns with the system's complexity and high-stakes application domain. (Code: FEA-EXPERIMENT)"
