In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies-such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks-to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows-namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity-critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Foundation models and intelligent decision-making: Progress, challenges, and perspectives', 'abstract': \"Intelligent decision-making (IDM) is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to automate or augment decision processes. Modern IDM paradigms integrate advanced frameworks to enable intelligent agents to make effective and adaptive choices and decompose complex tasks into manageable steps, such as AI agents and high-level reinforcement learning. Recent advances in multimodal foundation-based approaches unify diverse input modalities-such as vision, language, and sensory data-into a cohesive decision-making process. Foundation models (FMs) have become pivotal in science and industry, transforming decision-making and research capabilities. Their large-scale, multimodal data-processing abilities foster adaptability and interdisciplinary breakthroughs across fields such as healthcare, life sciences, and education. This survey examines IDM's evolution, advanced paradigms with FMs and their transformative impact on decision-making across diverse scientific and industrial domains, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in building efficient, adaptive, and ethical decision systems.\"}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Artificial intelligence: A key fulcrum for addressing complex environmental health issues', 'abstract': 'Environmental health (EH) is a complex and interdisciplinary field dedicated to the examination of environmental behaviours, toxicological effects, health risks, and strategies for mitigating harmful environmental factors. Traditional EH research investigates correlations between risk factors and health outcomes through control variables, but this route is difficult to address complex EH issue. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology not only has accelerated the innovation of the scientific research paradigm but also has become an important tool for solving complex EH problems. However, the in-depth and comprehensive implementation of AI in the field of EH still faces many barriers, such as model generalizability, data privacy protection, algorithm transparency, and regulatory and ethical issues. This review focuses on the compound exposures of EH and explores the potential, challenges, and development directions of AI in four key phases of EH research: (1) data collection, fusion, and management, (2) hazard identification and screening, (3) risk modeling and assessment and (4) EH management. It is not difficult to see that in the future, artificial intelligence technology will inevitably carry out multidimensional simulation of complex exposure factors through multi-mode data fusion, so as to achieve accurate identification of environmental health risks, and eventually become an efficient tool for global environmental health management. This review will help researchers re-examine this strategy and provide a reference for AI to solve complex exposure problems.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Cross-disciplinary perspectives on the potential for artificial intelligence across chemistry', 'abstract': 'From accelerating simulations and exploring chemical space, to experimental planning and integrating automation within experimental labs, artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the landscape of chemistry. We are seeing a significant increase in the number of publications leveraging these powerful data-driven insights and models to accelerate all aspects of chemical research. For example, how we represent molecules and materials to computer algorithms for predictive and generative models, as well as the physical mechanisms by which we perform experiments in the lab for automation.

Intrusion detection systems have become effective in monitoring network traffic and activities to identify anomalies that are indicative of attacks. However, constraints such as limited computing resources at fog nodes render conventional intrusion detection techniques impractical. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates stacked autoencoders, CatBoost, and an optimised transformer-CNN-LSTM ensemble tailored for intrusion detection in fog and IoT networks. Autoencoders extract robust features from high-dimensional traffic data while reducing the dimensionality of the efficiency at fog nodes. CatBoost refines features through predictive selection. The ensemble model combines self-attention, convolutions, and recurrence for comprehensive traffic analysis in the cloud. Evaluations of the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and AWID benchmarks demonstrate an accuracy of over 99% in detecting threats across traditional, hybrid enterprises and wireless environments. Integrated edge preprocessing and cloud-based ensemble learning pipelines enable efficient and accurate anomaly detection. The results highlight the viability of securing real-world fog and the IoT infrastructure against continuously evolving cyber-attacks.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Computational Design and Manufacturing of Sustainable Materials through First-Principles and Materiomics', 'abstract': 'Engineered materials are ubiquitous throughout society and are critical to the development of modern technology, yet many current material systems are inexorably tied to widespread deterioration of ecological processes. Next-generation material systems can address goals of environmental sustainability by providing alternatives to fossil fuel-based materials and by reducing destructive extraction processes, energy costs, and accumulation of solid waste. However, development of sustainable materials faces several key challenges including investigation, processing, and architecting of new feedstocks that are often relatively mechanically weak, complex, and difficult to characterize or standardize. In this review paper, we outline a framework for examining sustainability in material systems and discuss how recent developments in modeling, machine learning, and other computational tools can aid the discovery of novel sustainable materials. We consider these through the lens of materiomics, an approach that considers material systems holistically by incorporating perspectives of all relevant scales, beginning with first-principles approaches and extending through the macroscale to consider sustainable material design from the bottom-up. We follow with an examination of how computational methods are currently applied to select examples of sustainable material development, with particular emphasis on bioinspired and biobased materials, and conclude with perspectives on opportunities and open challenges.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'HEAR4Health: a blueprint for making computer audition a staple of modern healthcare', 'abstract': 'Recent years have seen a rapid increase in digital medicine research in an attempt to transform traditional healthcare systems to their modern, intelligent, and versatile equivalents that are adequately equipped to tackle contemporary challenges. This has led to a wave of applications that utilise AI technologies; first and foremost in the fields of medical imaging, but also in the use of wearables and other intelligent sensors. In comparison, computer audition can be seen to be lagging behind, at least in terms of commercial interest. Yet, audition has long been a staple assistant for medical practitioners, with the stethoscope being the quintessential sign of doctors around the world. Transforming this traditional technology with the use of AI entails a set of unique challenges. We categorise the advances needed in four key pillars: Hear, corresponding to the cornerstone technologies needed to analyse auditory signals in real-life conditions; Earlier, for the advances needed in computational and data efficiency; Attentively, for accounting to individual differences and handling the longitudinal nature of medical data; and, finally, Responsibly, for ensuring compliance to the ethical standards accorded to the field of medicine. Thus, we provide an overview and perspective of HEAR4Health: the sketch of a modern, ubiquitous sensing system that can bring computer audition on par with other AI technologies in the strive for improved healthcare systems.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Machine Learning in Polymer Research', 'abstract': 'Machine learning is increasingly being applied in polymer chemistry to link chemical structures to macroscopic properties of polymers and to identify chemical patterns in the polymer structures that help improve specific properties. To facilitate this, a chemical dataset needs to be translated into machine readable descriptors. However, limited and inadequately curated datasets, broad molecular weight distributions, and irregular polymer configurations pose significant challenges. Most off the shelf mathematical models often need refinement for specific applications. Addressing these challenges demand a close collaboration between chemists and mathematicians as chemists must formulate research questions in mathematical terms while mathematicians are required to refine models for specific applications. This review unites both disciplines to address dataset curation hurdles and highlight advances in polymer synthesis and modeling that enhance data availability. It then surveys ML approaches used to predict solid-state properties, solution behavior, composite performance, and emerging applications such as drug delivery and the polymer-biology interface. A perspective of the field is concluded and the importance of FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) data and the integration of polymer theory and data are discussed, and the thoughts on the machine-human interface are shared.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Artificial intelligence: A powerful paradigm for scientific research', 'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) coupled with promising machine learning (ML) techniques well known from computer science is broadly affecting many aspects of various fields including science and technology, industry, and even our day-to-day life.

Machine learning has the potential to accelerate cultured meat technology by streamlining experiments, predicting optimal results, and reducing experimentation time and resources. However, the use of machine learning in cultured meat is in its infancy. This review covers the work available to date on the use of machine learning in cultured meat and explores future possibilities. We address four major areas of cultured meat research and development: establishing cell lines, cell culture media design, microscopy and image analysis, and bioprocessing and food processing optimization. In addition, we have included a survey of datasets relevant to CM research. This review aims to provide the foundation necessary for both cultured meat and machine learning scientists to identify research opportunities at the intersection between cultured meat and machine learning.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem addressed by this research cluster revolves around securing resource-constrained environments, specifically fog computing architectures and IoT networks, against evolving cyber-attacks through the deployment of efficient, robust intrusion detection systems (IDS). This is reflected in the central nodes such as 'fog nodes', 'intrusion detection', 'intrusion detection system', and 'fog computing architecture', highlighting a strong focus on cybersecurity in distributed and resource-limited contexts. Thematic islands cluster closely around intrusion detection techniques and systems adapted for fog architectures, alongside a complementary cluster emphasizing 'data privacy protection', 'multi-modality data fusion', and the overarching 'directions of AI' and 'development direction of AI'. Dominant paradigms incorporate advanced ensemble learning approaches (e.g., transformer-CNN-LSTM ensembles), dimensionality reduction via stacked autoencoders, and multi-modal data fusion to improve detection accuracy and efficiency while respecting data privacy constraints. This landscape highlights the integration of AI-driven techniques within distributed systems for real-time and accurate anomaly detection under resource awareness constraints.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite advances in optimized intrusion detection and multi-modal data fusion, current work reveals several internal gaps: (1) The challenge of reconciling high detection accuracy with stringent resource limitations at fog nodes remains significant, as conventional heavy models are impractical. (2) Data privacy protection during IDS training and deployment in distributed environments lacks robust frameworks; present approaches have yet to fully integrate privacy-preserving mechanisms. (3) Transparency and interpretability of complex AI/ML intrusion detection systems are insufficiently addressed, undermining trust and deployment in operational networks. Bridge nodes such as 'fog nodes' and 'intrusion detection system' suggest these gaps straddle both technical feasibility and privacy/ethical constraints. External/Novel Gaps: Global analysis reveals a critical overlooked opportunity: integrating privacy-preserving learning methods, especially federated learning, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and multi-party computation (the 'hidden bridge' between 'intrusion detection techniques' and 'data privacy protection') into resource-aware IDS for fog computing. Such integration can enable collaboratively trained intrusion detection models without centralized raw data sharing, thus protecting privacy while enhancing generalizability and detection performance—a synergy absent from the local literature. Furthermore, emerging security paradigms involving blockchain for decentralized trust and anomaly reporting in IoT/fog environments are unexplored. These cross-disciplinary approaches, rooted in information and computing sciences (cybersecurity and privacy), promise to address key limitations identified locally.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate federated learning and differential privacy techniques from cybersecurity research into fog computing-based intrusion detection systems to enable privacy-preserving, collaborative learning across resource-constrained fog nodes, overcoming internal gaps related to data privacy and efficient model training. Opportunity 2: Develop transparent and interpretable ensemble models augmented with edge-aware homomorphic encryption to ensure secure, real-time intrusion detection while maintaining model explainability and user trust in fog architectures. Opportunity 3: Explore blockchain-enabled decentralized frameworks for intrusion detection data integrity and sharing among fog nodes and IoT devices, providing robustness against evolving cyber-attacks and enhancing detection coordination without centralized vulnerabilities, directly addressing limitations in current IDS operationalization and trust models."
