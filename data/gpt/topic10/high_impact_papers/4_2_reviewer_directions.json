    "title": "Open-Source Modular Framework for Transparent LLM-Human Interactive Systems in Psychology",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of interoperable software frameworks enabling transparent deployment, auditing, and community validation of LLM-driven human-in-the-loop psychological research tools.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal governance gap and technical deployment challenges (Opportunity 3), by leveraging human-robot interaction research and software architecture advances to foster transparent, adaptable research platforms.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an extendable, open-source framework with modular components for LLM integration, human input interfaces, ethical auditing tools, and collaborative validation dashboards. The framework will support plugin-based addition of new models, psychological tasks, and auditing protocols, encouraging reproducibility and incremental innovation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Architect baseline framework with core modules (LLM, UI, auditor). 2. Develop auditing metrics for emergent behavior and bias detection. 3. Integrate case study psychological tasks (e.g., language-based assessments). 4. Open beta with community feedback to refine modules and tooling.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Researcher loads dataset of language samples for depression severity estimation. Output: Interactive interface with real-time model explanations, ethical audit reports, and human annotator feedback loops coordinated through the framework.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If modular complexity impedes usability, offer simplified 'starter kits' targeting key tasks before providing full modularity. If auditing measures prove ineffective, incorporate external auditing tools for cross-validation."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan presents an ambitious development and evaluation sequence; however, it lacks detail on evaluation metrics and benchmarks for auditing tools and psychological task integration, which are critical for assessing feasibility and success. The plan should explicitly incorporate iterative user studies with target researcher communities to validate usability, transparency, and effectiveness of auditing dashboards. Additionally, contingency mechanisms for technical integration challenges, especially in plugin interoperability and ethical auditing algorithm robustness, need elaboration to bolster feasibility confidence. Clarifying these will make the experimental roadmap more scientifically robust and practical for deployment in real-world psychological research settings, ensuring incremental validation rather than solely engineering milestones. Thus, a revision incorporating these points is necessary before full-scale development proceeds, to increase the likelihood of a successful, community-adopted framework implementation and evaluation cycle in psychology research contexts, where stakes are high for transparency and reproducibility standards (e.g., explicitly measurable auditing success criteria, researcher engagement metrics, and model interpretability validation). Implied assumptions about developer and user expertise levels should also be addressed with targeted onboarding or documentation strategies within the plan to mitigate adoption risk early on, thereby enhancing the plan's realism and preparedness for typical deployment environments in psychological science labs or collaborative projects with human annotators and ethicists involved."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "To strengthen the competitiveness and scientific impact of this transparent LLM-human interactive system framework in psychology, I recommend integrating aspects of 'technological transparency' and 'determinants of users’ intention' from the globally-linked concepts. Specifically, the framework could incorporate structural equation modeling modules to analyze how hedonic motivation, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy influence researchers’ and clinicians' intention to adopt and trust the system. This integration would not only provide data-driven insights into user acceptance within psychological research workflows but also guide iterative design improvements to maximize usability and transparency. Further, linking usage intention predictors with real-time audit reports and interactive perception interfaces could create a closed feedback loop that scientifically advances understanding of human-AI interaction acceptance factors in digital health technologies. Embedding these models within the open-source platform would differentiate the framework from competitors by combining both engineering and behavioral science innovations, ultimately amplifying both academic novelty and practical impact in digital psychological assessment and intervention research."
