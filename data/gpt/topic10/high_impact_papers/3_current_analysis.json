The ML techniques have been developed to analyze high-throughput data with a view to obtaining useful insights, categorizing, predicting, and making evidence-based decisions in novel ways, which will promote the growth of novel applications and fuel the sustainable booming of AI. This paper undertakes a comprehensive survey on the development and application of AI in different aspects of fundamental sciences, including information science, mathematics, medical science, materials science, geoscience, life science, physics, and chemistry. The challenges that each discipline of science meets, and the potentials of AI techniques to handle these challenges, are discussed in detail. Moreover, we shed light on new research trends entailing the integration of AI into each scientific discipline. The aim of this paper is to provide a broad research guideline on fundamental sciences with potential infusion of AI, to help motivate researchers to deeply understand the state-of-the-art applications of AI-based fundamental sciences, and thereby to help promote the continuous development of these fundamental sciences.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Forecasting: theory and practice', 'abstract': 'Forecasting has always been at the forefront of decision making and planning. The uncertainty that surrounds the future is both exciting and challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise risks and maximise utilities. The large number of forecasting applications calls for a diverse set of forecasting methods to tackle real-life challenges. This article provides a non-systematic review of the theory and the practice of forecasting. We provide an overview of a wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles, and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety of real-life contexts. We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and applications. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of forecasting theory and practice. Given its encyclopedic nature, the intended mode of reading is non-linear. We offer cross-references to allow the readers to navigate through the various topics. We complement the theoretical concepts and applications covered by large lists of free or open-source software implementations and publicly-available databases.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Springer Handbook of Robotics', 'abstract': 'The second edition of this handbook provides a state-of-the-art cover view on the various aspects in the rapidly developing field of robotics. Reaching for the human frontier, robotics is vigorously engaged in the growing challenges of new emerging domains. Interacting, exploring, and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly touch people and their lives. The credible prospect of practical robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics as a modern scientific discipline. The ongoing vibrant expansion and strong growth of the field during the last decade has fueled this second edition of the Springer Handbook of Robotics. The first edition of the handbook soon became a landmark in robotics publishing and won the American Association of Publishers PROSE Award for Excellence in Physical Sciences & Mathematics as well as the organization’s Award for Engineering & Technology. The second edition of the handbook, edited by two internationally renowned scientists with the support of an outstanding team of seven part editors and more than 200 authors, continues to be an authoritative reference for robotics researchers, newcomers to the field, and scholars from related disciplines. The contents have been restructured to achieve four main objectives: the enlargement of foundational topics for robotics, the enlightenment of design of various types of robotic systems, the extension of the treatment on robots moving in the environment, and the enrichment of advanced robotics applications. Further to an extensive update, fifteen new chapters have been introduced on emerging topics, and a new generation of authors have joined the handbook’s team. A novel addition to the second edition is a comprehensive collection of multimedia references to more than 700 videos, which bring valuable insight into the contents. The videos can be viewed directly augmented into the text with a smartphone or tablet using a unique and specially designed app.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Trustworthy AI: From Principles to Practices', 'abstract': 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has enabled the deployment of various systems based on it. However, many current AI systems are found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection. These shortcomings degrade user experience and erode people’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we provide AI practitioners with a comprehensive guide for building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, and accountability. To unify currently available but fragmented approaches toward trustworthy AI, we organize them in a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to system development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items for practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers, engineers, and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges for the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for a paradigm shift toward comprehensively trustworthy AI systems.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology', 'abstract': 'The Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology (ESST) addresses the grand challenge for science and engineering today. It provides unprecedented, peer-reviewed coverage in more than 550 separate entries comprising 38 topical sections. ESST establishes a foundation for the many sustainability and policy evaluations being performed in institutions worldwide. An indispensable resource for scientists and engineers in developing new technologies and for applying existing technologies to sustainability, the Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology is presented at the university and professional level needed for scientists, engineers, and their students to support real progress in sustainability science and technology. Although the emphasis is on science and technology rather than policy, the Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology is also a comprehensive and authoritative resource for policy makers who want to understand the scope of research and development and how these bottom-up innovations map on to the sustainability challenge.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence', 'abstract': 'Abstract The book has two goals. The first goal is meta-theoretical and is fulfilled by Part One: an interpretation of the past (Chapter 1), the present (Chapter 2), and the future of AI (Chapter 3). Part One develops the thesis that AI is an unprecedented divorce between agency and intelligence. On this basis, Part Two investigates the consequences of such a divorce, developing the thesis that AI as a new form of agency can be harnessed ethically and unethically. Chapter 4 offers a unified perspective on the many principles that have been proposed to frame the ethics of AI. Chapter 5 discusses the potential risks that may undermine the application of these principles, and then Chapter 6 analyses the relation between ethical principles and legal norms, and offers a definition of soft ethics as post-compliance ethics. Chapters 7–9 analyse the ethical challenges caused by the development and use of AI, evil uses of AI, and good practices when applying AI. The last group of chapters focuses on AI for social good or AI4SG (Chapter 10), the positive and negative impacts of AI on the environment (Chapter 11), and the possibility of using AI in support of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (Chapter 12).The book concludes (Chapter 13) by arguing in favour of a new marriage between the Green of all our habitats and the Blue of all our digital technologies and how this new marriage can support and develop a better society and a healthier biosphere.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'New Horizons for a Data-Driven Economy, A Roadmap for Usage and Exploitation of Big Data in Europe', 'abstract': 'In this book readers will find technological discussions on the existing and emerging technologies across the different stages of the big data value chain. They will learn about legal aspects of big data, the social impact, and about education needs and requirements. And they will discover the business perspective and how big data technology can be exploited to deliver value within different sectors of the economy. The book is structured in four parts: Part I “The Big Data Opportunity” explores the value potential of big data with a particular focus on the European context. It also describes the legal, business and social dimensions that need to be addressed, and briefly introduces the European Commission’s BIG project. Part II “The Big Data Value Chain” details the complete big data lifecycle from a technical point of view, ranging from data acquisition, analysis, curation and storage, to data usage and exploitation. Next, Part III “Usage and Exploitation of Big Data” illustrates the value creation possibilities of big data applications in various sectors, including industry, healthcare, finance, energy, media and public services. Finally, Part IV “A Roadmap for Big Data Research” identifies and prioritizes the cross-sectorial requirements for big data research, and outlines the most urgent and challenging technological, economic, political and societal issues for big data in Europe. This compendium summarizes more than two years of work performed by a leading group of major European research centers and industries in the context of the BIG project. It brings together research findings, forecasts and estimates related to this challenging technological context that is becoming the major axis of the new digitally transformed business environment.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models', 'abstract': 'AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., BERT,\\nDALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a\\nwide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to\\nunderscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report\\nprovides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation\\nmodels, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics,\\nreasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model\\narchitectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation,\\ntheory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal\\nimpact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and\\nethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep\\nlearning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent\\ncapabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes\\nhomogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution,\\nas the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models\\ndownstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models,\\nwe currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and\\nwhat they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these\\nquestions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will\\nrequire deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their\\nfundamentally sociotechnical nature.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'The SAGE Handbook of Social Network Analysis', 'abstract': 'Awards:Choice Outstanding Academic Title, 2011Social network analysis has been one of the fastest growing and most influential areas of recent times.

The book can also serve as an introduction to several other important subfields of machine learning that are seldom touched upon in other books. Machine learning as a discipline would not be possible without the inner workings of optimization at hand. The book includes the necessary sinews of optimization though the crux of the discussion centers on the increasingly popular tool for training deep learning models, namely synthetic data. It is expected that the field of synthetic data will undergo exponential growth in the near future. This book serves as a comprehensive survey of the field. In the simplest case, synthetic data refers to computer-generated graphics used to train computer vision models. There are many more facets of synthetic data to consider. In the section on basic computer vision, the book discusses fundamental computer vision problems, both low-level (e.g., optical flow estimation) and high-level (e.g., object detection and semantic segmentation), synthetic environments and datasets for outdoor and urban scenes (autonomous driving), indoor scenes (indoor navigation), aerial navigation, and simulation environments for robotics. Additionally, it touches upon applications of synthetic data outside computer vision (in neural programming, bioinformatics, NLP, and more). It also surveys the work on improving synthetic data development and alternative ways to produce it such as GANs. The book introduces and reviews several different approaches to synthetic data in various domains of machine learning, most notably the following fields: domain adaptation for making synthetic data more realistic and/or adapting the models to be trained on synthetic data and differential privacy for generating synthetic data with privacy guarantees. This discussion is accompanied by an introduction into generative adversarial networks (GAN) and an introduction to differential privacy.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

generate a concise and insightful analysis report. The report must contain the following three sections:\n\n**1. Current Research Landscape & Core Consensus:**\n- Synthesize the foundational papers (Part A) with the local network analysis (Part B).\n- What is the central problem this research cluster is trying to solve, as suggested by the **Central Nodes (B1)** and **Thematic Islands (B2)**?\n- What are the dominant methods and core paradigms presented in this landscape?\n\n**2. Critical Gaps & Unexplored Frontiers:**\n- This is the most crucial part. Your insights must be a synthesis of all data.\n- **Internal Gaps:** Based on the 'Stated Limitations' in the papers (Part A) and the relationships revealed by the **Bridge Nodes (B3)**, what are the known, internal gaps?\n- **External/Novel Gaps:** Based on the **Global Context & Hidden Bridges (Part C)**, what novel connections or cross-disciplinary approaches have been overlooked by this specific set of papers? Explicitly state how a 'Hidden Bridge' concept could address a local problem.\n\n**3.

    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem collectively addressed by this research cluster is the integration and effective utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly foundation models, in scientific research and practical applications, with an emphasis on trustworthy, efficient, and scalable systems. The central nodes—such as 'artificial intelligence', 'booming of AI', 'integration of AI', 'trustworthy AI systems', and 'software implementation'—highlight a focus on advancing AI capabilities and deploying them in real-world systems. The identified thematic islands cluster around: (1) expanding AI's potential and integration, (2) development and dissemination of state-of-the-art models and open-source software implementations, (3) robotics and advanced robotic applications, (4) trustworthy AI system design and deployment, and (5) policy evaluation and engagement with policymakers. Dominant methods and paradigms include large-scale foundation models (e.g., BERT, GPT-3), software engineering for AI system development, trustworthiness frameworks encompassing robustness and fairness, synthetic data generation for deep learning, and interdisciplinary approaches linking AI to sustainability, ethics, and societal impact. These capture a landscape rooted in scalable deep learning technologies, robust system design, and a growing emphasis on ethical and policy dimensions.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps are primarily linked to the limited understanding of foundation models’ emergent behaviors, incomplete integration of trustworthiness aspects (such as fairness and privacy) throughout the AI system lifecycle, and insufficient bridging between AI capability development and real-world deployment constraints. The absence of bridge nodes in the local network suggests weak interconnection between sub-themes like trustworthy AI and practical robotics or policymaking, indicating siloed developments. Moreover, foundational papers signal challenges in explainability, monitoring, and ethical trustworthiness deployment. Externally, the global GPS analysis reveals overlooked cross-disciplinary opportunities, such as integrating regulatory and legal frameworks ('regulatory framework', 'legal framework', 'Artificial Intelligence Act') with software implementations to enhance compliance and trustworthy AI deployment. Another hidden bridge is the intersection between AI deployment ('booming of AI') and human-robot interaction enriched by user trust and cognitive modeling, currently weakly connected locally. Additionally, the connection between software implementation and healthcare policy or public health frameworks suggests potential for adaptive AI systems in regulated, sensitive domains, which is underexplored. These hidden bridges point to critical opportunities to unify technical AI advances with regulatory, ethical, and human-centric design to address current fragmentation and deepen practical impact.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate advanced regulatory and legal frameworks identified as global 'hidden bridge' concepts (e.g., 'Artificial Intelligence Act', 'EU legal framework') with the local thematic island of trustworthy AI system design (B2 cluster: 'trustworthy AI systems', 'AI systems'). This would address the internal gap of fragmented trustworthiness approaches (stated in foundational papers) by embedding compliance and governance systematically within software implementation lifecycles, enhancing reliability and societal acceptance.\n\nOpportunity 2: Fuse human-robot interaction research (global co-concepts: 'user interface', 'cognitive trust', 'human-robot interaction technology') with practical robotics (local cluster: 'practical robots', 'robotic development') and booming AI capabilities. This aims to fill the gap of weak integration between AI model robustness and user-centric design, improving real-world applicability, interpretability, and user trust in robotic systems leveraging resource-aware large language models.\n\nOpportunity 3: Develop AI software implementations informed by health policy and public health frameworks (global concepts: 'health-care providers', 'health policy-makers', 'public health policy-makers') integrated with open-source software and advanced models. By doing so, this opportunity harnesses synthetic data and trustworthy AI paradigms from foundational works to build resource-efficient NLP solutions uniquely designed for regulated healthcare contexts, thus addressing limitations in data privacy, robustness, and stakeholder trust in sensitive domains."
