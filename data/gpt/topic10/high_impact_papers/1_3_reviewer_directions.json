    "title": "Citizen Science-Enhanced Ontology Learning for Smart Government Services",
    "Problem_Statement": "Semantic frameworks used in e-government and smart services lack integration of collective intelligence from citizen science, preventing adaptive and context-aware ontology evolution.",
    "Motivation": "Directly seizes Opportunity 1 by fusing participatory, decision-support citizen data with ontology matching methods to enhance semantic web and adaptive service design for governmental applications.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Propose an Ontology Evolution system leveraging crowdsourced citizen science inputs combined with LLM-mediated semantic clustering to iteratively update government service ontologies for real-time contextual awareness and adaptability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect citizen feedback datasets from e-government platforms. 2. Perform semantic clustering with LLM embeddings augmented by crowd signals. 3. Update ontologies automatically using incremental ontology learning algorithms. 4. Compare with static ontology baselines in government service retrieval tasks. 5. Evaluate via precision, recall, ontology consistency, and user satisfaction surveys.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Citizen reports about public transport issues with varying terminologies. Expected Output: Dynamically updated ontology reflecting emergent terms, improving relevance in government service FAQs and decision support.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If ontology updates lead to inconsistencies, incorporate human-in-the-loop curation or set threshold-based update criteria to maintain ontology coherence."
