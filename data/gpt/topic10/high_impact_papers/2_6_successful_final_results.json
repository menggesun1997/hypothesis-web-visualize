        "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Dynamic Explanation Refinement in NLP Systems for Clinical Decision Support and Intelligent Tutoring",
        "Problem_Statement": "Static explanations generated by existing explainable AI (XAI) tools often fail to accommodate individual users' evolving ethical concerns, diverse understanding needs, and domain-specific contexts, particularly in high-stakes areas like clinical decision support and intelligent tutoring systems.",
        "Motivation": "To address the fragmentation gap in explanation utility and ethical alignment, we propose integrating iterative human feedback loops into NLP explanation generation specifically tailored for impactful domains such as patient safety in clinical decision support and personalized learning in intelligent tutoring systems. By grounding explanation refinement in these domains, we can harness domain-specific ethical considerations and user diversity, elevating transparency and trust beyond existing static or one-size-fits-all models. This approach leverages insights from human-robot interaction, collaborative intelligence, and adaptive pedagogy to realize ethically aware, user-centered explanation systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We will develop a dynamic NLP explanation framework incorporating interactive, iterative user feedback mechanisms that adapt explanation style, complexity, and ethical framing in real-time. The system targets clinical decision support scenarios—enhancing explanations for healthcare professionals regarding patient safety and treatment rationale—and intelligent tutoring contexts by adapting to learners’ comprehension and moral reasoning needs. To address the rigor and stability challenges of reinforcement learning (RL) for explanation refinement, we propose a hybrid optimization approach combining RL with supervised fine-tuning. This includes employing robust feedback aggregation strategies such as user clustering to model heterogeneous preferences, outlier filtering to handle noisy or contradictory inputs, and weighted consensus scoring to quantify subjective ethical perceptions. Such techniques aim to ensure stable RL convergence and practical viability with limited domain-specific data. Additionally, contingency fallback plans involve leveraging recommendation-based explanation selection informed by clustered user profiles, enabling effective personalization when adaptive learning is constrained.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement baseline explanation generation models customized for clinical decision support and intelligent tutoring domains; 2) Design and deploy feedback collection interfaces that enable nuanced user input capturing clarity, ethical acceptability, and trust perceptions via ratings, qualitative comments, and preference selections; 3) Develop and integrate a hybrid optimization pipeline combining reinforcement learning with supervised fine-tuning, utilizing feedback aggregation methods including clustering of user types and noise reduction mechanisms to handle subjective and conflicting feedback; 4) Conduct pilot studies on representative user populations—clinicians (e.g., patient safety officers) and learners from varied backgrounds—to collect diverse and rich feedback datasets; 5) Iteratively refine explanation generation models using the hybrid approach ensuring stable RL training through controlled experiments; 6) Evaluate improvements in understanding, trust, ethical alignment, and user satisfaction compared to static and non-adaptive baselines using quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments; 7) Analyze robustness of the system under different data availability scenarios and user heterogeneity to validate fallback strategies and hybrid model efficacy.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A clinician consulting an AI-based clinical decision support system requests ethical justification tailored towards patient safety after receiving a technical explanation of treatment recommendations. Output: The system progressively refines its explanation style—simplifying jargon, emphasizing patient safety risks and ethical considerations, and aligning with the clinician’s feedback patterns to improve clarity and trust.\n\nInput: A student interacting with an intelligent tutoring system signals confusion and ethical concerns about content presentation. Output: The system dynamically adjusts explanations to enhance pedagogical clarity and presents context-sensitive ethical framing acknowledging student values and comprehension levels.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If reinforcement learning convergence proves slow or unstable despite robust feedback aggregation and hybrid methods, we will prioritize supervised fine-tuning using accumulated feedback datasets and apply user clustering to enable personalized explanation recommendation via rule-based or nearest-neighbor approaches. Additionally, we plan to explore ensemble methods combining static explanation templates and adaptive models to maintain ethical alignment and user satisfaction when adaptive optimization is limited. User clustering will also enable domain experts to tailor explanations to prototypical user groups, ensuring practical value even when dynamic learning is constrained."

Clarifying methods for robust feedback aggregation, handling noisy or contradictory inputs, and ensuring stable RL training convergence are essential to demonstrate feasibility. Also, contingency plans beyond supervised fine-tuning, such as hybrid models or user clustering strategies, could strengthen practical viability, as pure RL approaches in user-centric explanation refinement can be notoriously challenging to optimize reliably in limited data regimes. Adding these specifics would greatly enhance confidence in the methodological feasibility and experimental rigor of the study, especially when targeting diverse user groups and ethical framing adaptations within NLP explanation systems. This is crucial before moving forward to implementation and evaluation phases in the experiment plan section. Target: Experiment_Plan."
