    "title": "Emotion-Adaptive Explainability Framework for LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current explainability methods for LLMs lack adaptability to varied user emotional and cognitive states, leading to ineffective trust-building and ethical understanding for diverse users.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap of limited assessment methodologies for explainability and lack of integration between user-centered design and technical explainability. Leverages the hidden bridge between recognition models and adaptive user interfaces to tailor explanations to emotional context.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an emotion-adaptive explainability framework that integrates real-time emotion recognition from user interactions with domain-adaptive XAI techniques. Using multimodal inputs (text and facial expression or voice tone), the framework customizes explanation complexity and style (e.g., causal, example-driven, narrative) to users' emotional states, enhancing comprehension and ethical awareness.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets combining NLP tasks with user emotion labels; 2) Implement baseline LLM with standard post-hoc XAI; 3) Develop emotion recognition module integrated with UI; 4) Combine with domain adaptation for explainability tailoring; 5) Evaluate on user trust, satisfaction, and explanation quality metrics using user studies and benchmark tasks; 6) Compare against static explainability models.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User interacts with a content moderation bot, recognized as frustrated via voice tone. The system provides a simplified, empathetic explanation of decisions with examples. Output: Explanation tailored to reduce frustration and increase clarity, e.g., 'I flagged your comment because certain words may violate our policy to keep conversations respectful.'",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If emotion recognition is noisy, fallback to generalized user profiles to select explanation styles. Alternatively, use explicit user feedback to adapt explanation preferences over time."

        "title": "Emotion-Adaptive Explainability Framework for Situated AI Agents Integrating Human-Robot Interaction and Technological Transparency",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current explainability methods for large language models (LLMs) do not adequately adapt to diverse user emotional and cognitive states, limiting their effectiveness in trust-building and ethical understanding. Moreover, these methods largely neglect the situated context of embodied AI agents and robots, where multimodal human-robot interaction (HRI) and technological transparency are critical for effective communication and user acceptance, especially in sensitive domains.",
        "Motivation": "Despite progress in explainability, existing frameworks generally lack integration of emotional intelligence with the multimodal complexities of human-robot interactions and principled transparency theories. Addressing this gap is essential to advance emotionally intelligent, transparent AI agents across modalities, ensuring explanations are tailored not only to users' emotional states but also to interaction contexts and user mental models. By embedding the emotion-adaptive explainability framework into embodied AI agents and leveraging technological transparency principles, this work fundamentally advances the state-of-the-art beyond competitive novelty, opening impactful applications in healthcare and assistive robotics (e.g., pediatric mental health, dementia care). The integration enables grounding evaluations with established HRI and transparency metrics, enhancing empirical rigor and interdisciplinary relevance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel emotion-adaptive explainability framework for situated AI agents combining advanced LLMs with embodied robots or assistive agents, integrating multimodal human emotion recognition (facial expressions, voice tone, physiological signals) and contextual interaction cues. The framework employs domain-adaptive XAI techniques to dynamically tailor explanation styles (causal, example-based, narrative) according to users' emotional and cognitive states, interaction context, and their mental models, guided by technological transparency constructs. We adopt information fusion techniques to robustly combine heterogeneous emotional and contextual signals, incorporating privacy-preserving mechanisms (e.g., differential privacy, on-device processing) to mitigate privacy risks and noise. The framework also includes iterative user feedback loops to refine explanation adaptation over time. This approach incorporates interdisciplinary standards from human-robot interaction and transparency research, enabling new evaluation strategies grounded in HRI trust, usability, and transparency metrics, and is designed for deployment in applications demanding sensitive emotional adaptation and ethical transparency.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Creation: Collaborate with healthcare and HRI research centers to collect a novel multimodal dataset combining NLP tasks with synchronized annotations of user emotional states (via facial, vocal, physiological sensors) in interactive robot scenarios, ensuring ethical approval and privacy compliance. 2) Emotion Recognition Module: Develop and validate a multimodal emotion recognition system using information fusion and privacy-preserving techniques; assess robustness and noise resilience. 3) Explainability Module: Adapt and extend domain-adaptive XAI methods for LLMs embedded in AI agents, parametrized by emotional and contextual inputs guided by technological transparency metrics. 4) Framework Integration: Implement the end-to-end system on a robotic platform supporting conversational AI, enabling real-time, emotion-aware explanation adaptation. 5) Pilot User Studies: Conduct controlled pilot studies with representative users (including vulnerable populations) to evaluate feasibility and refine protocols. 6) Comprehensive User Studies: Deploy rigorous user evaluations measuring trust, satisfaction, explanation quality, mental model alignment, and transparency using validated psychometric instruments and HRI/technological transparency metrics; employ structural equation modeling to analyze determinants of usage intention and explanatory effectiveness. 7) Comparative Analysis: Benchmark against static and non-situated explainability baselines to quantify gains in user outcomes and ethical transparency. All experiments will include detailed documentation to ensure reproducibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: In a pediatric mental health support scenario, a robot assistant interacts with a child exhibiting anxiety detected via voice tone and facial cues. The system provides empathetic, simplified causal and example-driven explanations about its recommendations, enhancing trust and reducing distress (e.g., \"I suggested this game because it helps you feel calm when you're upset.\").\nExample 2: In dementia care, an assistive agent detects user confusion through multimodal signals and supplies narrative explanations about medication reminders tailored to cognitive state and prior interactions, supporting user autonomy and transparency.\nExample 3: During a content moderation interaction mediated by a robotic help-desk employing an LLM, user frustration is sensed through vocal stress and facial tension; the agent adapts explanations to be concise and reassuring, explicitly referencing transparency components (e.g., \"I flagged your comment because our policy aims to keep conversations respectful to everyone.\").",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal emotion recognition suffers from high noise or privacy concerns limit data availability, the system will revert to using generalized, domain-informed user profiles combined with explicit, user-controlled feedback mechanisms to personalize explanation styles incrementally. Privacy-preserving synthetic data augmentation and semi-supervised learning will be explored to improve emotion recognition robustness. For experimental evaluation, pilot studies will focus on behaviorally-grounded proxies and qualitative feedback to ensure feasibility before full-scale user trials. Additionally, simpler transparency adaptation heuristics based on interaction context and user expertise may complement emotion-based adaptation, maintaining essential personalized explainability capabilities."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed experiment plan's steps are logically ordered and generally sound, but further details are needed to ensure feasibility and rigor. Specifically, collecting datasets that combine NLP tasks with labeled user emotions, including multimodal inputs (text, facial expressions, voice tone), is nontrivial and may require significant resources or novel data collection efforts. The plan should clarify the availability or creation of such data, and detail measures to address noise in emotion recognition and potential privacy concerns. Also, evaluation metrics for trust, satisfaction, and explanation quality need operational definitions and validated instruments. Without this, it risks challenges in reproducibility and conclusive results. Strengthening these aspects will improve experimental robustness and practicality of the methodology proposal to validate the framework effectively in real-world or controlled user studies, rather than remain conceptual or preliminary only at a proof-of-concept level. This refinement is crucial for gaining confidence in the framework’s applicability and performance claims in the competitive XAI and emotion recognition area where empirical rigor is a strong differentiator from novelty alone.\n\nSuggestion: Include plans for dataset sourcing/creation protocols, noise/privacy mitigation strategies, detailed metric definitions, and pilot study outlines to demonstrate feasibility before full user studies are conducted. This will elevate the experimental methodology from high-level outline to actionable, validated research design plans suitable for a premier conference submission and follow-up work phases. Furthermore, addressing these will improve reproducibility and impact assessment quality, critical for acceptance and community uptake of this interdisciplinary framework integrating emotional intelligence with explainability in LLMs.\n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "Given the 'NOV-COMPETITIVE' novelty assessment and the strong existing links between emotion recognition, explainability, and user adaptation, a concrete way to significantly enhance the research idea's impact and novelty is to explicitly integrate concepts from 'human-robot interaction' and 'technological transparency'. By extending the emotion-adaptive explainability framework beyond LLMs to embodied AI agents or robots that use language models, the research can address richer multimodal interactions and situational awareness in human-robot teams. Incorporating 'technological transparency' principles will also strengthen ethical understanding and trust-building by systematically linking explainability styles to transparency metrics and user mental models. \n\nThis broader framing would allow leveraging established evaluation metrics from HRI and transparency research, thus grounding evaluations in interdisciplinary standards. It would also open pathways to applications in domains like healthcare (e.g., 'pediatric mental health' or 'dementia care') where emotional adaptation in explanations can be especially impactful for vulnerable users. \n\nTherefore, I encourage the authors to consider expanding their framework’s scope and experimental validation to include situated interactive systems that combine LLMs with robotics or assistive agents, explicitly connecting to human-robot interaction literature and technological transparency theory. This integration can elevate the work beyond competitive novelty by situating it as a foundational building block for emotionally intelligent, transparent AI agents across modalities and domains.\n\nTarget Section: Motivation / Proposed_Method"
