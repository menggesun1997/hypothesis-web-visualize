    "title": "Adaptive Self-Management Tool for Psychological Care Leveraging LLM-Driven Quality Improvement Cycles",
    "Problem_Statement": "Self-management tools lack dynamic adaptability informed by LLM-driven quality improvement frameworks to personalize psychological care effectively.",
    "Motivation": "Exploits the hidden bridge between software implementations and psychological domains to embed QI strategies within self-management platforms, innovating psychological measurement and care (Opportunity 1).",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a patient-facing digital tool powered by LLMs that iteratively updates personalized care plans based on user-reported outcomes and QI feedback loops involving clinicians' guidance, promoting empowerment and enhanced measurement accuracy.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Build prototype self-management app integrating LLM and QI modules. 2. Recruit patient cohorts with mood disorders. 3. Collect longitudinal self-report and clinician feedback. 4. Measure symptom trajectory improvements, patient engagement, and care plan adaptability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User journals daily mood fluctuations and medication adherence. Output: LLM adapts motivational prompts and care recommendations, integrating clinician feedback to optimize management.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time adaptation proves unstable, implement batch update cycles or clinician-mediated adjustments. If patient engagement drops, integrate gamification elements."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks clarity on how exactly the LLM integrates with the Quality Improvement (QI) feedback loops involving clinicians. Specifically, the mechanism by which user-reported outcomes are transformed into actionable adaptations through LLM reasoning and clinician input needs elaboration. Clarify the model architecture, data flow, and decision-making process to strengthen methodological soundness and reproducibility, ensuring confidence in the adaptive personalization process described in the proposal's Method section and illustrated via Test_Case_Examples. Without this, assumptions about effective dynamic adaptation remain unvalidated and risky for deployment in psychological care contexts requiring high ethical and clinical standards, consistent with the Problem_Statement's claims and Motivations goals to innovate care through bridging software and psychological domains efficiently and safely."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment, you could enhance both impact and differentiation by integrating established patient engagement and usability measurement methods, such as the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire, to rigorously quantify and improve user experience. Additionally, expanding use cases beyond mood disorders to include chronic conditions (e.g., chronic rheumatic diseases) or neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD could broaden the scope and real-world applicability, tapping into diverse patient pathways where adaptive self-management and digital health technologies hold high potential. Incorporating stress detection models or adaptive feedback via smart glasses could also introduce multimodal input/output paths, refining personalization and reinforcing the embedded QI strategy as a generalizable platform rather than a narrowly focused app, thus addressing both impact and novelty concerns."
