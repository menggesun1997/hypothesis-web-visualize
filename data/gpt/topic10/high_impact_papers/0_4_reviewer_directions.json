    "title": "Blockchain-backed Audit Trail System for AI-generated Scientific Publications",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is an absence of immutable, transparent audit mechanisms to track the provenance, modifications, and legal compliance of AI-generated scientific content, raising concerns about accountability and reproducibility.",
    "Motivation": "This idea combines the critical gap on transparency/accountability and the external linkage between legal practice and news media by deploying blockchain technology as a tamper-proof ledger for all steps in AI-assisted scientific discovery pipelines, ensuring robust auditability and compliance traceability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design and implement a blockchain-based infrastructure integrated with AI scientific writing platforms that records all editing versions, AI-generation events, author interventions, and legal compliance validations cryptographically. Smart contracts encode legal publication requirements and automatically trigger alerts or blocks if compliance conditions are unmet. A user interface visualizes the audit trail for publishers and regulators.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop prototype smart contracts encoding sample legal frameworks and editorial policies. 2) Integrate with an open-source scientific writing assistant backed by an LLM. 3) Simulate AI generation, author edits, and compliance checks with recording on a private blockchain network. 4) Evaluate system performance for scalability, transparency, trustworthiness, and resistance to tampering. 5) Engage legal and scientific publishing stakeholders for usability feedback.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI-generated article draft undergoing multiple revisions and compliance validations. Expected Output: Blockchain-recorded immutable log showing each generation and edit event with timestamps and compliance status, accessible for independent verification.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain scalability constraints arise, explore hybrid off-chain/on-chain solutions or distributed ledger technologies with higher throughput. Alternatively, develop cryptographically signed centralized audit logs with rigorous access controls."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method outlines integration of blockchain infrastructure with AI scientific writing platforms and the use of smart contracts to encode legal policies. However, it lacks clarity on key technical challenges: How exactly will editing versions, AI generation events, and compliance validations be captured and structured for blockchain recording? How will the system handle latency or throughput limitations inherent in blockchain for real-time editing events? The link between blockchain transaction mechanisms and editorial workflows needs more precise detailing and justification to ensure system coherence and practicality. Clarifying these mechanisms will strengthen confidence in soundness and technical viability of the approach, particularly regarding synchronization, data granularity, and trust assumptions across stakeholders, as the problem demands stringent audit guarantees without impacting usability or workflow efficiency. Please provide an explicit design or architecture sketch explaining data flows, blockchain interaction points, and how smart contracts enforce legal compliance in a live environment with evolving AI-generated content and human edits, addressing scalability and update conflicts clearly within the Proposed_Method section."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the strong existing work linking blockchain and auditability, consider enhancing the idea by integrating privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques from the globally-linked concepts such as zero-knowledge proofs or differential privacy. For instance, zero-knowledge proofs can enable the system to verify compliance or provenance claims without revealing sensitive content, addressing privacy concerns in scientific publishing. Additionally, exploring post-quantum blockchain or consortium blockchain technology could improve scalability and security. Integrating these advanced cryptographic or distributed ledger concepts would elevate the proposal’s novelty and impact by addressing confidentiality, scalability, and security in a way not commonly combined with audit trails for AI scientific publications. This enhancement can be incorporated as a key design consideration or an extension in the Proposed_Method to position the work competitively."
