    "title": "Collaborative Bias Mitigation via Human-Robot Interaction in NLP",
    "Problem_Statement": "Bias mitigation in LLMs is often static and lacks dynamic human input, leading to persistent ethical issues in model behavior at deployment time.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses fragmentation between technical neural development and human-centric ethical evaluation by leveraging the human-robot interaction insights from the 'impact of AI' and 'adaptive user interfaces' bridge. Proposes a collaborative intelligence framework incorporating real-time human feedback for bias correction.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an interactive NLP system where human moderators and end-users provide real-time feedback signals on bias and fairness issues during model responses. The system dynamically adapts using reinforcement learning from human feedback to update bias mitigation modules. Employ explainability tools to show users the impact of their feedback.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build an interactive conversational LLM platform; 2) Design interfaces for real-time ethical feedback collection; 3) Implement RLHF-based bias mitigation learning loops; 4) Use existing fairness/fake news datasets with human annotators; 5) Evaluate bias metrics pre- and post-feedback integration, measure user satisfaction and ethical alignment; 6) Compare with static bias mitigation baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User detects stereotypical language in chatbot response and flags it. Output: Chatbot adjusts future outputs to avoid biased language, with displayed explanation of changes made.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time feedback is sparse, aggregate periodic batch feedback to update models offline. Include synthetic bias discovery datasets to augment real-time signals."
