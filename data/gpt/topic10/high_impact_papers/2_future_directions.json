        "title": "Emotion-Adaptive Explainability Framework for LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current explainability methods for LLMs lack adaptability to varied user emotional and cognitive states, leading to ineffective trust-building and ethical understanding for diverse users.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap of limited assessment methodologies for explainability and lack of integration between user-centered design and technical explainability. Leverages the hidden bridge between recognition models and adaptive user interfaces to tailor explanations to emotional context.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an emotion-adaptive explainability framework that integrates real-time emotion recognition from user interactions with domain-adaptive XAI techniques. Using multimodal inputs (text and facial expression or voice tone), the framework customizes explanation complexity and style (e.g., causal, example-driven, narrative) to users' emotional states, enhancing comprehension and ethical awareness.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets combining NLP tasks with user emotion labels; 2) Implement baseline LLM with standard post-hoc XAI; 3) Develop emotion recognition module integrated with UI; 4) Combine with domain adaptation for explainability tailoring; 5) Evaluate on user trust, satisfaction, and explanation quality metrics using user studies and benchmark tasks; 6) Compare against static explainability models.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User interacts with a content moderation bot, recognized as frustrated via voice tone. The system provides a simplified, empathetic explanation of decisions with examples. Output: Explanation tailored to reduce frustration and increase clarity, e.g., 'I flagged your comment because certain words may violate our policy to keep conversations respectful.'",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If emotion recognition is noisy, fallback to generalized user profiles to select explanation styles. Alternatively, use explicit user feedback to adapt explanation preferences over time."
