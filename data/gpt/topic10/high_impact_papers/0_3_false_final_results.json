    "title": "Cross-Domain Legal-AI Corpus for Transparent Scientific Publishing",
    "Problem_Statement": "The shortage of interdisciplinary datasets bridging legal frameworks, scientific publishing norms, and AI-generated content hampers development of frameworks ensuring ethical compliance and verifiability in AI-assisted scientific writing.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of compartmentalization between legal practice and publication ethics by creating an integrated resource that enables cross-disciplinary research and system development meeting both legal and editorial verification needs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Curate and annotate a large-scale corpus comprised of legal documents (laws, regulations on AI and publication), scientific manuscripts with AI-augmented content, and news media reports on AI ethics. Annotations include legal compliance markers, misinformation flags, and editorial revision histories. Build a benchmark suite for NLP models to detect, classify, and reason about legal and ethical issues in AI-generated scientific texts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Aggregate publicly available legal texts, scientific articles, and news datasets. 2) Collaborate with legal experts and editors to annotate datasets for compliance and misinformation. 3) Develop annotation guidelines bridging legal and editorial perspectives. 4) Release corpus with baselines for tasks like compliance classification, misinformation detection, and AI-generated content identification. 5) Host shared tasks to stimulate innovation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Sample Input: AI-generated abstract with factual inconsistencies and missing citations tied to legal disclosure requirements. Expected Output: Annotations marking these deficiencies flagged for legal and editorial attention, supporting trainable AI modules.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cross-domain annotation proves inconsistent, focus on modular parallel corpora with alignment heuristics. Also explore semi-supervised annotation to expand corpus size and diversity."
