    "title": "Bridging Trustworthy AI and Human-Robot Interaction through Cognitive Trust Modeling and Resource-Aware LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current AI models in robotics insufficiently integrate cognitive trust considerations, resulting in disjointed trustworthy AI system designs and practical robotic applications.",
    "Motivation": "Targets internal fragmentation between trustworthy AI and robotics by integrating cognitive trust models directly within resource-aware LLM-driven robotic AI agents, inspired by Innovation Opportunity 2â€™s hidden bridge between AI deployment and human-robot interaction.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a unified framework embedding cognitive trust constructs (e.g., perceived competence, reliability) as latent states within resource-efficient LLM architectures controlling robots. The framework employs continuous user feedback to update trust estimations, which directly shape model behaviors such as explanations, error recovery, and adaptation. The design improves user trust and system robustness in real-world HRI.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Define cognitive trust metrics and collect HRI interaction datasets. 2) Develop trust state embedding mechanisms within transformer decoders. 3) Train LLM-robot controllers with multi-objective loss including trust consistency. 4) Simulate real-world interaction scenarios with human subjects evaluating trust dynamics, task success, and computational efficiency.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Robot delivering medication with occasional drops. Model uses trust embedding to modulate communication style and error explanations to maintain user confidence.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If trust embeddings are ineffective, incorporate external trust prediction modules feeding back into model. If resource constraints cause latency, optimize with model pruning and caching strategies."

          "feedback_content": "While the idea of embedding cognitive trust constructs as latent states within resource-aware LLM architectures is compelling, the current description lacks clarity on the exact mechanism by which continuous user feedback updates trust estimations and how these updates concretely influence the model's behavior in real time. More specifics on the model architecture, how trust states are represented, updated, and integrated into decision-making and communication strategies would enhance soundness and reproducibility. Clarify how the multi-objective loss enforces trust consistency and how that affects model predictions or actions dynamically during interaction phases, especially under resource constraints. Without these details, the core method risks being underspecified and difficult to validate or build upon reliably in practice. Please elaborate and formalize these components in the Proposed_Method section to ensure rigorous grounding and interpretability of the approach in trustworthy HRI contexts, including possible mathematical formulations or system diagrams if applicable.\"},"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty screening and the strong links among core concepts, enhancing global integration can improve impact and distinctiveness. Specifically, consider incorporating 'deep reinforcement learning' or 'intelligent decision-making' paradigms from the globally-linked concepts to augment or adapt the trust-aware LLM controller. For example, embedding trust dynamics as a state or reward signal in a reinforcement learning framework could enable robots to learn adaptive trust-sensitive policies over time in complex, dynamic environments. Additionally, exploring 'ethical decision-making' aspects could broaden societal impact by addressing moral acceptability issues emerging from trust interactions. This integration could differentiate the work, lead to novel algorithmic designs, and attract wider interest from multiple communities within trustworthy AI, HRI, and ethical robotics. Update the motivation and proposed method accordingly with this broader, interdisciplinary framing and concrete integration pathways."
