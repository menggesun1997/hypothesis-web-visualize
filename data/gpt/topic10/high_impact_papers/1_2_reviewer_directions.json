    "title": "Social Context-Grounded LLM Knowledge Transfer for Inclusive NLP",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM knowledge transfer mechanisms insufficiently ground in social and demographic contexts from citizen science and policy data, limiting NLP applicationsâ€™ societal relevance and inclusivity.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external gap connecting social science empirical theories with participatory frameworks to embed societal and political context into LLM-driven NLP, broadening application horizons to social complexity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a Social Context Grounding module that fuses demographic, policy, and citizen science participatory data into LLM training and fine-tuning pipelines via context embeddings and bias-adaptive fine-tuning, enabling more socially responsive NLP outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Gather social science datasets integrating citizen science contributions and policy documents with demographic annotations. 2. Develop context embedding generators reflecting social dimensions. 3. Integrate into LLM tuning with bias-adaptive objective functions. 4. Evaluate on fairness, inclusivity, and context-aware NLP benchmarks. 5. Metrics: demographic parity, social sensitivity scores, and task accuracy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: NLP system processing social media data mentioning minority group issues. Expected Output: Contextually aware, unbiased language generation respecting social nuances, policy implications, and demographic realities.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If social embeddings degrade model performance, employ contrastive learning to disentangle social context from semantic content or incorporate post-hoc bias mitigation techniques."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method's mechanism of integrating social context via 'context embeddings' and 'bias-adaptive fine-tuning' requires clearer elaboration. Specifically, it is unclear how demographic, policy, and citizen science data are encoded uniformly, how these embeddings interact with the LLM's internal representations, and how bias-adaptive objectives concretely adjust training to incorporate social context without entangling it harmfully with semantic content. Providing formal definitions or computational frameworks for these modules will strengthen soundness and reproducibility evidence, helping reviewers and practitioners understand and validate the methodology comprehensively. Consider including example formulations or architectural diagrams to clarify the integration pipeline and training objectives tailored for social context grounding in LLMs, along with potential trade-offs between accuracy and fairness constraints assessed in training dynamics or ablation studies for transparency and robustness assurance in the approach."

          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty is classified as 'NOV-COMPETITIVE', the proposal can significantly benefit from integrating 'urban digital twin' and 'cultural awareness' frameworks to enlarge the impact and novelty horizon. For instance, embedding demographic and policy data contextualized within an 'urban digital twin' simulation could enable the LLM to model dynamic, location- and culture-specific social interactions more accurately and responsively. This would enrich the social context grounding with real-time or predictive urban data streams, such as mobility, cultural events, or local governance activities, thereby enhancing NLP system applicability for smart city applications and participatory governance. Incorporating cultural awareness explicitly at the embedding or fine-tuning stages would further mitigate biases and cultivate inclusive language generation tailored to diverse urban populations. This fusion could produce a unique niche that differentiates the work from existing social context incorporation and aligns well with cutting-edge multidisciplinary challenges in NLP and social informatics."
