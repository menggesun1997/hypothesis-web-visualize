    "title": "Quality Improvement-Informed LLM Fine-Tuning for Dynamic Psychological Measurement Adaptation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Static LLM models do not adapt well to longitudinal psychological datasets with evolving measurement protocols, risking outdated or inaccurate assessments.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the gap in leveraging quality improvement (QI) and measurement-based care to create adaptive psychological models (Opportunity 1), enabling dynamic updates in human-in-the-loop settings.",
    "Proposed_Method": "A continuous fine-tuning system where LLMs are periodically updated using QI cycle results from human-led evaluations. Incorporates adaptive learning rate modulation based on measurement error signals and human feedback quality indices, ensuring model evolution mirrors clinical measurement updates.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Acquire longitudinal psychological datasets with repeated measures. 2. Define baseline static LLM models. 3. Implement QI feedback collection from clinicians. 4. Conduct iterative fine-tuning experiments. 5. Evaluate via prediction accuracy improvement, clinician satisfaction, and model stability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Repeated language samples from a patient reporting anxiety over 6 months. Output: Model updates reflecting shifts in symptom expression with progressively accurate anxiety severity estimation scores.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If fine-tuning destabilizes models, constrain updates to lightweight calibration layers or mixture-of-expert gating. If human feedback is inconsistent, weight feedback by rater agreement metrics."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that fine-tuning LLMs continuously with quality improvement (QI) cycles will reliably capture evolving psychological measurement protocols needs stronger justification. Psychological assessments often suffer from noisy, subjective, and inconsistent clinical feedback that might destabilize model updates. Clarify how the approach explicitly accounts for or mitigates fundamental challenges like changing symptom definitions, heterogeneous patient language, and variable clinician input reliability to avoid undermining soundness of the adaptation mechanism. This will strengthen confidence in the foundational premise of continuous clinical fine-tuning for psychological longitudinal data adaptation, especially given the fallback plans suggest non-trivial instability risks under the main method assumptions are partially unvalidated yet consistent performance is required in practice. Without this clarity, the problem framing may rest on overly optimistic assumptions about LLM adaptability under realistic clinical data shifts and human feedback noise patterns, limiting the soundness of the core idea's practicality and impact potential at scale and over time. Consider including a dedicated analysis of the types and distributions of expected feedback noise and measurement drift in the problem statement or methodological section to validate these assumptions upfront, or outline specific robustness mechanisms beyond fallback plans tied to gating or calibration layers as primary components rather than contingencies. Given that human feedback quality indices are central yet could be unstable or unreliable themselves, expanding the conceptual coverage of how this data is modeled and weighted systematically within the fine-tuning loop is recommended to improve soundness from the ground up.  \n\nSummary: Provide a more rigorous grounding and explicit mitigation strategies for key assumptions about feedback reliability and measurement stability to enhance soundness of the proposed continuous fine-tuning approach in dynamic psychological measurement contexts.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step-by-Step Experiment Plan outlines key phases but lacks critical practical details compromising feasibility evaluation. For instance, the plan does not specify how longitudinal psychological datasets will be acquired or what inclusion criteria ensure they capture evolving measurement protocols, which is central to validating the idea. Clarify the data provenance, size, diversity, and how clinical feedback will be systematically collected, standardized, and timestamped to enable meaningful QI cycles; these operational details heavily influence feasibility. Additionally, the plan should specify the criteria and methods for defining baseline static LLM models (e.g., model sizes, pretraining corpora, clinical domain adaptation), as these baselines critically contextualize intervention benefits. The evaluation metrics should be expanded beyond prediction accuracy and clinician satisfaction to include metrics that measure model robustness, convergence stability over multiple fine-tuning cycles, and temporal alignment with clinical measurement changes, addressing risks of catastrophic forgetting or overfitting to noisy feedback. Finally, consider potential ethical and privacy constraints around clinical data use, integration of human feedback, and iterative model updates, which may impact feasibility in clinical settings. Explicitly addressing how these will be managed will strengthen the experimental plan's practicality and make it more convincing and actionable for real-world deployment scenarios. \n\nSummary: Augment the experiment plan with detailed data acquisition protocols, feedback collection methodologies, baseline definitions, comprehensive evaluation metrics (including model stability), and ethical/privacy considerations to ensure scientific and operational feasibility of the investigation."
