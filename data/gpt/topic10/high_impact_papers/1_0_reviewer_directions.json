    "title": "Collective Semantic Alignment for Context-Aware LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current ontology matching techniques lack effective integration of participatory data from citizen science, limiting LLMs' ability to grasp nuanced, context-dependent semantic variations in cross-domain applications.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap linking citizen science contributions with ontology matching, enhancing semantic frameworks by incorporating collective intelligence, thus improving LLM adaptability in real-world, context-rich scenarios.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a Collective Semantic Alignment framework combining crowd-sourced annotations and LLM embeddings via a hybrid probabilistic ontology matcher that integrates human-contextual signals from citizen science datasets into semantic alignment processes, creating context-aware, adaptive ontologies aiding LLM knowledge transfer.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect citizen science datasets with semantic annotations (e.g., biodiversity reports). 2. Build probabilistic ontology matchers augmented with human contextual signals. 3. Integrate with LLM embeddings for cross-domain semantic tasks. 4. Baselines: traditional ontology matchers and purely automated embeddings. 5. Metrics: alignment accuracy, contextual semantic coherence, and downstream NLP task performance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Citizen scientist reports labeling local plant species with diverse vernacular terms. Expected Output: Ontology matching aligns vernacular terms to scientific taxonomy with contextual nuances preserved, improving named entity recognition in ecological NLP applications.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If collective data is noisy, apply denoising autoencoders and active learning to refine annotations. Alternatively, shift to simulated participatory data or expert-validated subsets to bootstrap semantic alignment."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a hybrid probabilistic ontology matcher integrating crowd-sourced annotations with LLM embeddings, but it lacks sufficient clarity on how these components interact operationally. Specifically, the fusion strategy between human contextual signals and embedding representations needs elaborationâ€”are probabilistic outputs combined via weighting, or is there a joint learning mechanism? Detailing this mechanism is critical to assess replicability and potential effectiveness. The Innovator should explicitly describe the integration architecture, the role of probabilistic reasoning, and how uncertainties from crowd signals are managed within the semantic alignment process to enhance soundness and clarity, making the approach more concrete and assessable for implementation and evaluation purposes. This refinement can also reveal potential challenges earlier, guiding more targeted experimentation and feasibility analysis. This is a fundamental step before all else for robust development and review of the idea's core technical mechanism, and to avoid conceptual ambiguity that might hamper progress or adoption in practical NLP contexts involving LLMs and ontology alignment.  Target this feedback to the Proposed_Method section for detailed augmentation and clarifications."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "While the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan appropriately identifies key procedural steps and baselines, it overlooks potential challenges in the collection and quality control of citizen science semantic annotations, which are known to be noisy, heterogeneous, and sparse. Although a fallback plan is mentioned, the current plan should explicitly include intermediate validation methods (e.g., annotation reliability metrics, inter-annotator agreement) and scalable quality assurance mechanisms, such as crowdsourcing protocols or expert vetting strategies, integrated into the experiment pipeline. Moreover, the plan could benefit from more nuanced evaluation metrics beyond alignment accuracy and coherence, for example, measuring the impact of semantic alignment on LLM downstream adaptation or transfer learning efficacy. Including these refinements can improve feasibility, provide clearer go/no-go criteria, and better handle real-world citizen science data complexity. The Innovator should thus iterate on the experiment design within the Experiment_Plan section to fortify scientific rigor, practical feasibility, and robustness against noisy data challenges."
