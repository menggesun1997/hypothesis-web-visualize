    "title": "Cross-Domain Semantic Embedding via Participatory Knowledge Graphs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM-driven semantic embeddings do not sufficiently leverage participatory knowledge graphs from citizen science, limiting cross-domain semantic interoperability and transferability.",
    "Motivation": "Exploits a hidden bridge by integrating decentralized, participatory knowledge graphs into semantic embedding space construction, boosting LLM cross-domain adaptability and interpretability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a multi-layer participatory knowledge graph aggregation method that encodes citizen-contributed domain knowledge into semantic embedding refinements for LLMs, enabling dynamic cross-domain transfer with enhanced semantic richness and human-centered context.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Aggregate citizen science knowledge graphs from multiple domains. 2. Design embedding refinement algorithms that fuse knowledge graph context with LLM embeddings. 3. Test on cross-domain NLP tasks requiring semantic transfer. 4. Baselines: standard LLM embeddings without participatory augmentation. 5. Metrics: cross-domain transfer accuracy, semantic coherence, and human interpretability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Scientific document referencing domain-specific citizen terms. Expected Output: Semantically enriched embedding representations accommodating cross-domain terms for improved question answering and information retrieval.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If participatory graphs are incomplete or sparse, incorporate graph completion techniques or synthetic data augmentation to improve coverage."

It is crucial to elucidate how multi-layer aggregation is operationalized, how knowledge graph context is quantitatively fused into embeddings, and how dynamic cross-domain transfer is enabled. Without a clear algorithmic framework or illustrative model, the soundness and reproducibility of the approach remain questionable. I recommend the authors explicitly specify the embedding refinement algorithms, detail encoding strategies for the knowledge graphs, and describe the interface with LLM embeddings to strengthen the method's credibility and feasibility assessment framework. This will also help reviewers and readers understand novel contributions beyond existing fusion approaches in semantic embedding research, addressing concerns given the NOV-COMPETITIVE status of the idea's area."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is general and lacks sufficient detail crucial to judge feasibility. For example, how will citizen science knowledge graphs be aggregated, normalized, and validated across multiple domains? What are the sources and qualities of these graphs, and how will their heterogeneity and sparsity be addressed practically? The plan also omits details on dataset scale, baseline selection rationale, and specific cross-domain NLP tasks to be targeted, limiting reproducibility and impact assessment. Additionally, metrics such as 'semantic coherence' and 'human interpretability' require clear operational definitions and evaluation protocols. I advise the authors to concretely define datasets, preprocessing pipelines, task benchmarks, and quantitative/human evaluation methods to solidify feasibility claims and to enable meaningful comparisons with existing baselines."
