    "title": "Ethically Governed LLM-Integrated Social Robot for Moral Agency-Driven Psychological Interventions",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of robotic systems that embed moral agency explicitly for ethical, psychologically informed interventions in sensitive human contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Bridges psychological and robotic research gaps by concretely embedding normative moral agency frameworks into LLM-driven robot interactions, expanding human-in-the-loop testing with ethical safeguards (Opportunity 2).",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an LLM-augmented social robot embedded with formal moral agency modules inspired by computational ethical reasoning (e.g., deontic logic). The system generates intervention dialogue constrained by ethical policies while monitoring psychological state indicators, providing adaptive and ethically sound responses.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Formalize moral agency rules compatible with NLP constraints. 2. Integrate with LLM dialogue generation conditioned on these rules. 3. Test in experimental psychological therapy simulations with human participants. 4. Measure ethical compliance, participant comfort, and intervention efficacy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Participant reveals suicidal ideation during interaction. Output: Robot triggers ethical protocols to provide supportive, non-harmful responses and recommend human clinician involvement, maintaining privacy and safety standards.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time moral reasoning proves computationally costly, pre-script critical ethical scenarios for robot fallback. Alternatively, implement human-in-the-loop ethical decision overrides during intervention."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines integrating formal moral agency modules with LLM-driven dialogue constrained by ethical policies. However, the interaction mechanism between the moral agent components and the LLM is insufficiently detailed. Specifically, it's unclear how deontic logic-based reasoning will practically condition or guide the LLM's natural language output in real time, especially given LLMs' stochastic generation nature. Clarify: how are moral reasoning outputs operationalized as constraints or prompts within the LLM? What architectural or algorithmic choices ensure consistent, reliable adherence to ethical constraints without excessive computational overhead? A more explicit pipeline or modular system design would strengthen the soundness of the method and support feasibility assessments of real-time ethical interventions in conversation-based settings. Without this, the integration risks being conceptually plausible but practically ambiguous or technically fragile.\n\nConsider including schematic diagrams or pseudo-code examples illustrating the integration workflow between moral agency modules and LLM dialogue generation to concretize the approach for reviewers and implementers alike, enhancing confidence in the method's soundness and clarity."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan introduces valuable stages but raises concerns about experimental feasibility and scientific rigor in human participant testing. Stage 3 proposes testing in psychological therapy simulations with human subjects to measure ethical compliance, comfort, and efficacy, yet lacks details on participant recruitment, ethical approvals, and concrete evaluation metrics.\n\nPractically, conducting human trials involving psychological states, especially sensitive disclosures like suicidal ideation, necessitates strict ethical safeguards, clinical oversight, and validated assessment protocols. The proposal should elaborate on how ethical risks to participants will be managed, data privacy guaranteed, and interventions' psychological effects systematically measured (e.g., validated psychometric scales, behavioral observations).\n\nMoreover, the fallback plan suggests human-in-the-loop overrides as a backup, yet the experiment design should clarify whether and how these fallbacks are integrated into the testing phases as controls or baselines to disambiguate the LLM-driven system's contributions. Addressing these considerations is critical to ensure the proposed method's feasibility and to gain acceptance from IRBs and the clinical research community for human-involved experiments."
