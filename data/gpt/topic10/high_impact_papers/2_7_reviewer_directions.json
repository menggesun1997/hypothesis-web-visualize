    "title": "Emotion-Aware Federated LLM Training for Bias Reduction",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM training via federated learning neglects user emotional context that could inform bias mitigation strategies, limiting ethical responsiveness.",
    "Motivation": "Combines the critical gaps in privacy-preserving training and emotion recognition to design federated learning architectures sensitive to emotional signals, tackling external gap in integrating recognition models with ethical LLM development.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce an emotion-aware federated learning mechanism where aggregated emotional state distributions from user data guide adaptive bias correction modules during LLM training without violating privacy. Use secure multiparty computation to transmit anonymized emotional trends influencing training loss adjustments.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multimodal emotional text data partitioned across devices; 2) Develop federated training protocols capturing emotional statistics; 3) Implement bias mitigation modules informed by emotions; 4) Evaluate model fairness, privacy guarantees, and emotional alignment; 5) Benchmark against emotion-agnostic federated LLMs.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Decentralized social media text datasets annotated with stress or joy indicators. Output: Trained LLM displays reduced biased outputs towards stressed user groups, validated in sentiment classification tasks.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If emotion statistic aggregation compromises privacy, use aggregated proxy variables or emotional sentiment averages with weaker granularity."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks clarity on how exactly the aggregated emotional state distributions will guide the adaptive bias correction modules during federated LLM training. It is not clearly explained how emotional trends influence the training loss adjustments without introducing significant noise or undermining model stability. More detailed description and theoretical justification are needed to validate the mechanism and ensure it realistically integrates emotions into bias mitigation processes within federated learning constraints, including privacy and communication efficiency considerations. Without such clarity, the soundness of the proposed approach remains uncertain and may hinder reproducibility and effective implementation of the mechanism as outlined in the experiment plan, so this is critical to address first. For example, providing a mathematical formulation of how the emotional statistics quantitatively modulate bias correction and how secure multiparty computation ensures privacy while enabling effective aggregation would strengthen the proposal significantly.\n\nTargeting Proposed_Method section, please elaborate on the precise algorithmic flow and theoretical underpinnings binding emotional context to federated bias correction modules in a privacy-preserving manner to improve soundness and credibility of the approach.\n\n"

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a reasonable sequence but overlooks critical practical challenges that could jeopardize feasibility. Specifically, collecting multimodal emotional text data partitioned across devices is stated, but the plan lacks details on how to ensure sufficient data heterogeneity without violating privacy or encountering labeling noise. Moreover, implementing federated training protocols that accurately capture emotional statistics while preserving strict privacy guarantees and managing communication overhead is non-trivial and demands concrete protocol designs and validation strategies.\n\nFurther, the evaluation criteria (model fairness, privacy guarantees, emotional alignment) require explicit metrics and benchmarks that are sensitive to the emotional dimensionâ€”something not sufficiently detailed here. Also, the fallback plan is somewhat simplistic and may cause the system to lose the gained benefits if privacy concerns arise.\n\nEnhancing the experiment plan with precise data sourcing strategies, privacy-preserving aggregation methods, relevant fairness and emotional alignment metrics, and contingency strategies more robust than the fallback plan would substantially improve the feasibility and reliability of the experimentation.\n\nTargeting Experiment_Plan section, please enrich details on data acquisition, privacy protocols, evaluation metrics, fallback contingencies, and resource estimates to mitigate implementation risks and strengthen feasibility.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict is only NOV-COMPETITIVE, integrating concepts from 'human-centric artificial intelligence' and 'health sensing' could elevate the research's impact and distinctiveness. For instance, extending the emotion-aware federated LLM training framework to incorporate health sensing signals (like stress markers or behavioral health indicators) alongside text-based emotional data could create a richer multimodal context for bias mitigation.\n\nThis integration aligns with human-centric AI goals, enhances ethical responsiveness, and opens applications in health-related language modeling tasks, such as automated depression detection. Incorporating these globally-relevant concepts could also facilitate leveraging pre-existing health sensing datasets and specialized fairness benchmarks, broadening the scope and impact beyond social media text to sensitive healthcare domains.\n\nTargeting Title and Problem_Statement, consider explicitly proposing a multimodal human-centric emotion and health-aware federated training paradigm, thus differentiating your approach substantively and increasing its ethical and societal impact."
