    "title": "Empirical-Theoretical Integration of Translation Studies and Biomedical Ontologies",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current biomedical ontology matching lacks integration of empirical human linguistic knowledge from translation studies, impairing the semantic normalization accuracy of LLMs in biomedical NLP.",
    "Motivation": "Bridges internal gaps between empirical theory in translation studies and computational ontology alignment, proposing a unified framework to enhance explainability and accuracy in biomedical semantics for LLMs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an Empirical-Theoretical Framework that encodes linguistic context and translation heuristics from interpreting studies into an ontology alignment model, using multi-modal embeddings combining empirical linguistic features and biomedical ontology structures, facilitating explainable semantic normalization for LLM-driven tasks.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Compile datasets from biomedical ontologies (e.g., UMLS) and parallel corpora from translation studies. 2. Extract empirical linguistic features reflecting translation strategies. 3. Design multi-modal embeddings integrating these features with ontology representations. 4. Evaluate on biomedical entity linking and ontology alignment benchmarks. 5. Metrics: accuracy, interpretability scores, and biomedical NLP downstream task improvements.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Biomedical text with ambiguous terms like 'cold' (common vs. clinical). Expected Output: Ontology mapping disambiguates and normalizes term leveraging translation context features, improving entity linking precision.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If linguistic features have limited impact, experiment with attention mechanisms that prioritize translated sense contexts or incorporate expert-in-the-loop feedback for feature selection."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that integrating empirical linguistic knowledge from translation studies into biomedical ontology matching will significantly enhance semantic normalization for LLMs requires stronger theoretical or empirical justification. Currently, the link between translation heuristics and improved biomedical semantic accuracy is asserted but not substantiated with prior evidence or preliminary analyses. The authors should provide more rigorous justification or pilot data demonstrating why translation studies uniquely contribute beyond existing computational linguistic or biomedical semantics research to validate this foundational premise before advancing the approach further. Clarifying this assumption will strengthen the proposal's soundness."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the proposal's core focus on ontology alignment using linguistic features from translation studies, a promising avenue is to integrate recent advances in contextualized embeddings from generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) and leverage these for multi-modal embedding construction. By aligning translation-informed linguistic embeddings with transformer-based contextual biomedical embeddings, the model could better handle ambiguity and domain-specific nuances. Additionally, linking to knowledge graph question answering or clinical corpora from patient-centered care could broaden impact and practical relevance. This would sharpen novelty and impact leveraging globally linked, state-of-the-art NLP and biomedical AI concepts to elevate the contribution beyond current competitive baselines."
