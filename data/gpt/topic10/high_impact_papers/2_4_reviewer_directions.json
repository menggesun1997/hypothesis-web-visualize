    "title": "Emotion-Driven Domain Adaptation for Ethical NLP Interfaces",
    "Problem_Statement": "Domain adaptation in NLP often ignores user emotional states, leading to less effective, sometimes biased interactions in sensitive domains like healthcare or education.",
    "Motivation": "Explores the hidden bridge between recognition models and adaptive user interfaces to create ethically responsive NLP systems that customize domain adaptations based on real-time user emotions to reduce bias and improve engagement.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an emotion-driven domain adaptation framework for LLM-based systems that dynamically adjusts language style, vocabulary, and explanation depth according to detected emotional cues, ensuring ethically sensitive responses tailored for domain-specific user needs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop domain-specific datasets with emotion annotations; 2) Train baseline domain adaptation LLMs; 3) Integrate emotion recognition modules; 4) Implement dynamic adaptation mechanisms; 5) Evaluate ethical alignment, bias reduction, and user satisfaction in domain tasks; 6) Conduct user studies in healthcare chatbot simulation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: In a healthcare NLP system, user showing anxiety receives more reassuring and simplified explanations, avoiding technical jargon. Output: Response style shifts to calming tone, improving understanding and reducing stress.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If emotion detection is inaccurate, incorporate user explicit feedback to guide domain adaptation or default to conservative neutral interaction modes."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is ambitious but lacks clarity on how emotion recognition will be accurately integrated with large language models for dynamic domain adaptation. The plan should include concrete metrics for emotion detection accuracy, methods for synchronizing emotional cues with adaptation mechanisms in real-time, and contingency protocols for ambiguous or conflicting signals. Additionally, dataset construction with emotion annotations must clarify collection methods, domain diversity, and emotion categories to ensure generalizability and ethical validity of the adaptation. Addressing these points will enhance the study’s reproducibility and practical feasibility in sensitive domains like healthcare chatbots where stakes are high and errors costly. Please expand and detail the experimental methodology accordingly in the Experiment_Plan section to improve scientific rigor and feasibility assessment.”,"

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "To elevate both the novelty and impact beyond the competitive baseline, consider integrating advanced techniques from the globally-linked concepts such as leveraging state-of-the-art Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) combined with nuanced sentiment analysis and mental health prediction modules. For example, incorporate gated recurrent units or convolutional neural networks as part of the emotion recognition pipeline to enhance robustness and temporal modeling of emotional states. Coupling these with assistive technology frameworks and insights from human-computer interaction, especially in mental health care or psychotherapy systems, could position the framework as uniquely situated at the intersection of ethically-aware adaptive NLP and real-world therapeutic interventions. Embedding these cross-disciplinary elements strongly aligns with the motivation to reduce bias and improve engagement, thus broadening the system’s relevance and scientific contribution. Please augment your Proposed_Method or Motivation sections accordingly to reflect this integration and clarify how it advances beyond existing domain adaptation methods.”,"
