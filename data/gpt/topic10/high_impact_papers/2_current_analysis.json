With the technological development of deep learning-based high-precision recognition models and natural generation models, Metaverse is being strengthened with various factors, from mobile-based always-on access to connectivity with reality using virtual currency. The integration of enhanced social activities and neural-net methods requires a new definition of Metaverse suitable for the present, different from the previous Metaverse. This paper divides the concepts and essential techniques necessary for realizing the Metaverse into three components (i.e., hardware, software, and contents) and three approaches (i.e., user interaction, implementation, and application) rather than marketing or hardware approach to conduct a comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, we describe essential methods based on three components and techniques to Metaverse’s representative Ready Player One, Roblox, and Facebook research in the domain of films, games, and studies. Finally, we summarize the limitations and directions for implementing the immersive Metaverse as social influences, constraints, and open challenges.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): What we know and what is left to attain Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence', 'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently being utilized in a wide range of sophisticated applications, but the outcomes of many AI models are challenging to comprehend and trust due to their black-box nature. Usually, it is essential to understand the reasoning behind an AI model’s decision-making. Thus, the need for eXplainable AI (XAI) methods for improving trust in AI models has arisen. XAI has become a popular research subject within the AI field in recent years. Existing survey papers have tackled the concepts of XAI, its general terms, and post-hoc explainability methods but there have not been any reviews that have looked at the assessment methods, available tools, XAI datasets, and other related aspects. Therefore, in this comprehensive study, we provide readers with an overview of the current research and trends in this rapidly emerging area with a case study example. The study starts by explaining the background of XAI, common definitions, and summarizing recently proposed techniques in XAI for supervised machine learning. The review divides XAI techniques into four axes using a hierarchical categorization system: (i) data explainability, (ii) model explainability, (iii) post-hoc explainability, and (iv) assessment of explanations. We also introduce available evaluation metrics as well as open-source packages and datasets with future research directions. Then, the significance of explainability in terms of legal demands, user viewpoints, and application orientation is outlined, termed as XAI concerns. This paper advocates for tailoring explanation content to specific user types. An examination of XAI techniques and evaluation was conducted by looking at 410 critical articles, published between January 2016 and October 2022, in reputed journals and using a wide range of research databases as a source of information. The article is aimed at XAI researchers who are interested in making their AI models more trustworthy, as well as towards researchers from other disciplines who are looking for effective XAI methods to complete tasks with confidence while communicating meaning from data.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Opportunities and obstacles for deep learning in biology and medicine', 'abstract': \"Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.\"}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Neural Networks and Deep Learning, A Textbook', 'abstract': 'This book covers both classical and modern models in deep learning. The chapters of this book span three categories: The basics of neural networks: Many traditional machine learning models can be understood as special cases of neural networks. An emphasis is placed in the first two chapters on understanding the relationship between traditional machine learning and neural networks. Support vector machines, linear/logistic regression, singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, and recommender systems are shown to be special cases of neural networks. These methods are studied together with recent feature engineering methods like word2vec. Fundamentals of neural networks: A detailed discussion of training and regularization is provided in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapters 5 and 6 present radial-basis function (RBF) networks and restricted Boltzmann machines. Advanced topics in neural networks: Chapters 7 and8 discuss recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Several advanced topics like deep reinforcement learning, neural Turing machines, Kohonen self-organizing maps, and generative adversarial networks are introduced in Chapters 9 and 10.

Recommender systems have proven to be a valuable way for online users to cope with the information overload and have become one of the most powerful and popular tools in electronic commerce. Correspondingly, various techniques for recommendation generation have been proposed. During the last decade, many of them have also been successfully deployed in commercial environments. Recommender Systems Handbook, an edited volume, is a multi-disciplinary effort that involves world-wide experts from diverse fields, such as artificial intelligence, human computer interaction, information technology, data mining, statistics, adaptive user interfaces, decision support systems, marketing, and consumer behavior. Theoreticiansand practitioners from these fields continually seek techniques for more efficient, cost-effective and accurate recommender systems. This handbook aims to impose a degree of order on this diversity, by presenting a coherent and unified repository of recommender systems’ major concepts, theories, methodologies, trends, challenges and applications. Extensive artificial applications, a variety of real-world applications, and detailed case studies are included.

Recent advances in computational pipelines, multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing and management tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society closer to reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in many applications. Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow, mirrored system, avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent status of methodologies and techniques related to the construction of digital twins mostly from a modeling perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage of the current challenges and enabling technologies along with recommendations and reflections for various stakeholders.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Summary of ChatGPT-Related research and perspective towards the future of large language models', 'abstract': \"This paper presents a comprehensive survey of ChatGPT-related (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) research, state-of-the-art large language models (LLM) from the GPT series, and their prospective applications across diverse domains.

The thematic islands reveal subfields emphasizing recognition models and neural net methods supported by hardware approaches; the broad impact and emergence of AI technologies; AI models and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to improve transparency and trustworthiness; neural network architectures and their application cases; adaptive user interfaces embodied in recommender systems to enhance user interaction; and cyber-physical intelligent systems exemplified by digital twins. Dominant methods involve deep learning neural networks, reinforcement learning (notably Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), and post-hoc XAI techniques. The cluster reflects efforts to tackle AI's influence across domains, focusing on interpretability, user-centered adaptive technologies, and cyber-physical system integration.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps include the limited assessment methodologies for explainability in AI models, as highlighted by the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks for XAI identified in foundational papers. Additionally, there is a noted deficiency in bridging user-centered design principles with technical explainability, resulting in explanations that are not always tailored to diverse user needs. The absence of bridge nodes connecting thematic islands suggests a fragmentation between subfields, particularly between technical neural model development and human-computer interaction or ethical evaluation frameworks. Externally, the Global Context reveals several overlooked connections that could enrich bias mitigation and ethical evaluation in LLM-driven NLP. For example, the 'recognition model' and 'adaptive user interfaces' link suggests integrating domain adaptation and emotion recognition techniques into NLP interfaces, enhancing ethical responsiveness and user satisfaction. Another hidden bridge between 'impact of AI' and 'adaptive user interfaces' indicates opportunities to incorporate human-robot interaction and collaborative intelligence paradigms, potentially translating to more ethical and bias-aware LLM deployments. Furthermore, the connections between 'AI models' and 'cyber-physical intelligent systems' open avenues for deploying federated learning and multi-layered cybersecurity in NLP systems, addressing privacy concerns that are central to ethical AI.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate domain adaptation and emotion detection methods (from the 'recognition model' and 'adaptive user interfaces' bridge) with XAI techniques to create user-tailored explanations that reflect diverse emotional and cognitive states. This addresses the gap in explanation assessment and user-specific trust-building stated in the foundational literature.\n\nOpportunity 2: Leverage cybersecurity frameworks and federated learning approaches evident in the 'AI models' and 'cyber-physical intelligent systems' link to develop privacy-preserving LLM training pipelines. This innovation would directly confront ethical and privacy constraints identified as key challenges in current AI applications.\n\nOpportunity 3: Apply collaborative intelligence and human-robot interaction insights (from 'impact of AI' and 'adaptive user interfaces' bridge) to build interactive NLP systems that incorporate human feedback in real time, enhancing ethical oversight and bias mitigation dynamically. This novel cross-disciplinary approach responds to the fragmentation between technical and human-centric research domains observed in the local network."
