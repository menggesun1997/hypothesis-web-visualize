The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'AMA Manual of Style', 'abstract': 'Abstract The AMA Manual of Style, 11th edition, is a must-have guide for those seeking to publish research findings and anyone involved in medical, health, or scientific writing and publishing.

Over the recent years, a revolutionary new paradigm has been developed for training models for NLP. These models are first pre-trained on large collections of text documents to acquire general syntactic knowledge and semantic information. Then, they are fine-tuned for specific tasks, which they can often solve with superhuman accuracy. When the models are large enough, they can be instructed by prompts to solve new tasks without any fine-tuning. Moreover, they can be applied to a wide range of different media and problem domains, ranging from image and video processing to robot control learning. Because they provide a blueprint for solving many tasks in artificial intelligence, they have been called Foundation Models. After a brief introduction tobasic NLP models the main pre-trained language models BERT, GPT and sequence-to-sequence transformer are described, as well as the concepts of self-attention and context-sensitive embedding. Then, different approaches to improving these models are discussed, such as expanding the pre-training criteria, increasing the length of input texts, or including extra knowledge. An overview of the best-performing models for about twenty application areas is then presented, e.g., question answering, translation, story generation, dialog systems, generating images from text, etc. For each application area, the strengths and weaknesses of current models are discussed, and an outlook on further developments is given. In addition, links are provided to freely available program code.

    "title": "Adaptive LLM-Augmented NLP Research Pipelines for Scientific Discovery: Landscape Map",
    "current_research_landscape": "The core focus of this research cluster revolves around the intersection of legal practice, scientific writing/preparation of articles, and the digital transformation within information technology industries—particularly how these domains adapt to and integrate AI, especially generative AI like ChatGPT. Central nodes indicate a predominant concern for the legal frameworks and challenges associated with AI's impact on established scholarly communication processes and organizational transformations. The landscape is enriched by clusters focused on legal paradigms (public and private law including human rights, criminal law), editorial and publication practices (preparation of articles, scientific writing, news media), and digital organizational changes within the information technology sector.\n\nDominant methodologies emphasize multidisciplinary analysis combining legal scholarship, ethical frameworks, and AI technical architectures (e.g., foundation models, pre-training/fine-tuning paradigms) applied to natural language processing tasks. The foundational papers detail both technological advances in foundation models (e.g., BERT, GPT) and the pressing social-legal-ethical issues raised by AI deployment across sectors. These include data transparency, bias, misinformation, and regulatory adaptations. This multifaceted approach reflects a paradigm where novel NLP capabilities must be harmonized with evolving legal, ethical, and organizational requirements to leverage AI for scholarly and scientific discovery effectively.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite recognizing AI's transformative potential and associated challenges, key internal gaps persist. Notably, the integration of advanced AI tools like foundation models into legal practice and scientific publishing lacks robust frameworks ensuring ethical compliance, transparency, and accountability. The bridge node 'legal practice' highlights the compartmentalization between legal considerations and other thematic areas such as media and digital transformation, indicating insufficient interdisciplinary collaboration for coherent policy and practice development. Additionally, scholarly guidance on how to evaluate and verify AI-generated content remains limited, leaving risks of misinformation and bias insufficiently mitigated.\n\nExternal/Novel Gaps: The GPS global context reveals promising but underexplored connections, such as between 'legal practice' and 'news media' or 'information technology industry'. For example, the concept of 'legal mechanisms' and 'media reports' could inform protocols ensuring AI-generated scientific content's veracity and legal compliance. Similarly, linking 'legal practice' and 'information technology industry' through concepts like 'personal information privacy' and 'regulatory gaps' exposes unmet needs in governing AI-driven data handling within NLP pipelines. Finally, bridging 'news media' and 'information technology industry' via 'technological innovation' and 'disclosure quality' suggests potential to enhance transparency and quality assurance in AI-augmented research dissemination—an angle currently lacking in the core literature.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Develop integrated legal-technical frameworks combining the 'legal practice' and 'news media' clusters to design verifiable, transparent AI-augmented scientific writing tools. By incorporating insights from 'legal mechanisms' and 'analysis of news media' (Global Context C), these frameworks can address the internal gap of managing misinformation and ethical/legal risks in AI-generated research outputs.\n\nOpportunity 2: Foster cross-disciplinary research investigating privacy-preserving and regulatory-compliant AI pipelines by merging themes from 'legal practice' with 'information technology industry'. Leveraging the 'personal information privacy' and 'regulatory gaps' concepts uncovered globally, this direction would innovatively tackle the fragmented regulation of AI applications in scientific NLP, enhancing trust and adoption.\n\nOpportunity 3: Utilize insights from the 'news media' and 'information technology industry' linkage on 'technological innovation' and 'disclosure quality' to create adaptive NLP platforms that systematically enhance transparency in AI-based scientific discovery workflows. This can bridge organizational digital transformation efforts with ethical publication practices, thus filling a critical void in systematized quality control for AI-augmented research outputs."
