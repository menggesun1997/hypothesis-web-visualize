    "title": "Blockchain-backed Audit Trail System for AI-generated Scientific Publications",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is an absence of immutable, transparent audit mechanisms to track the provenance, modifications, and legal compliance of AI-generated scientific content, raising concerns about accountability and reproducibility.",
    "Motivation": "This idea combines the critical gap on transparency/accountability and the external linkage between legal practice and news media by deploying blockchain technology as a tamper-proof ledger for all steps in AI-assisted scientific discovery pipelines, ensuring robust auditability and compliance traceability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design and implement a blockchain-based infrastructure integrated with AI scientific writing platforms that records all editing versions, AI-generation events, author interventions, and legal compliance validations cryptographically. Smart contracts encode legal publication requirements and automatically trigger alerts or blocks if compliance conditions are unmet. A user interface visualizes the audit trail for publishers and regulators.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop prototype smart contracts encoding sample legal frameworks and editorial policies. 2) Integrate with an open-source scientific writing assistant backed by an LLM. 3) Simulate AI generation, author edits, and compliance checks with recording on a private blockchain network. 4) Evaluate system performance for scalability, transparency, trustworthiness, and resistance to tampering. 5) Engage legal and scientific publishing stakeholders for usability feedback.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI-generated article draft undergoing multiple revisions and compliance validations. Expected Output: Blockchain-recorded immutable log showing each generation and edit event with timestamps and compliance status, accessible for independent verification.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain scalability constraints arise, explore hybrid off-chain/on-chain solutions or distributed ledger technologies with higher throughput. Alternatively, develop cryptographically signed centralized audit logs with rigorous access controls."

        "title": "Privacy-preserving Consortium Blockchain Audit Trail for AI-generated Scientific Publications with Zero-Knowledge Compliance Verification",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current scientific publishing workflows that incorporate AI-assisted content generation lack an immutable, transparent, and privacy-preserving audit mechanism to track provenance, author edits, AI interventions, and legal compliance validations. This absence raises critical concerns about accountability, reproducibility, privacy of unpublished scientific content, and compliance verification that can be independently trusted without exposing sensitive research details.",
        "Motivation": "While blockchain-based audit trails have emerged for ensuring transparency and immutability in digital content workflows, their application to AI-generated scientific publications confronts unique challenges: frequent, fine-grained edits occurring in real-time; evolving legal and ethical compliance requirements; stringent privacy demands in pre-publication research; and scalability constraints of public blockchains. Our approach leverages consortium blockchain technology tailored for scientific publishers, augmented by advanced cryptographic techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs for confidential compliance verification, providing a novel, scalable, and privacy-preserving audit mechanism. This integration advances the state-of-the-art by enabling verifiable legal compliance and immutable provenance tracking without compromising sensitive content confidentiality or workflow efficiency, thus offering a competitive and impactful solution in this emerging research area.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular architecture composed of the following key components:\n\n1) **Federated Editorial Clients:** Scientific authors and editors use integrated AI-assisted writing tools equipped with local modules to capture and structure editing events, AI-generated content markers, and compliance metadata. These clients batch changes and compute cryptographic commitments representing the current manuscript state.\n\n2) **Consortium Blockchain Network:** A permissioned blockchain operated by a consortium of scientific publishers and regulatory stakeholders acts as an immutable ledger. Instead of recording full content, it stores cryptographic hashes of manuscript states and metadata transactions, enabling scalability and protecting confidentiality.\n\n3) **Smart Contracts for Legal Compliance:** Encoded as modular, updateable smart contracts on the blockchain, these contracts define publication legal policies, ethical guidelines, and compliance checks. When invoked, they validate submitted commitments against compliance criteria.\n\n4) **Zero-Knowledge Proof Generator:** At the client side, zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) protocols enable authors to prove compliance properties (e.g., plagiarism checks passed, conflict of interest disclosures verified) without revealing the underlying sensitive content. ZKPs are submitted along with blockchain transactions, allowing smart contracts to verify compliance proofs succinctly.\n\n5) **Workflow Synchronization and Conflict Resolution Layer:** To handle real-time edits and potential conflicts, the system employs operational transformation or CRDT-based synchronization ensuring eventual consistency. Edited batches are committed asynchronously to the blockchain, balancing latency and throughput constraints.\n\n6) **Audit Visualization Interface:** Publishers and regulators access a dashboard that presents an immutable audit trail showing timestamped manuscript states, AI-generation events, author interventions, and compliance verification statuses. The interface supports selective disclosure using cryptographic access controls.\n\nThrough this architecture, our method handles granularity by committing verifiable snapshots of evolving manuscript states instead of recording every keystroke, thus managing throughput and latency. Trust assumptions are minimized via decentralized blockchain governance and cryptographic proofs, enhancing system soundness. Blockchain transaction points occur at commit milestones triggered by client-side batching, enabling practical integration within editorial workflows without degradation of usability. The consortium model allows scalability improvements and legal compliance alignment across institutions. Finally, advanced cryptographic primitives such as post-quantum secure signature schemes (e.g., eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme) ensure future-proof security.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement and deploy the federated editorial client prototype integrated with a standard LLM-based scientific writing assistant, instrumented to capture editing events and generate cryptographic commitments.\n2) Develop a permissioned consortium blockchain testbed with smart contracts encoding sample publication legal policies and compliance logic.\n3) Design and integrate zero-knowledge proof protocols specific to compliance properties relevant to scientific publishing (e.g., authorship integrity, conflict of interest).\n4) Simulate realistic writing scenarios involving AI content generation, human revisions, and compliance checks with asynchronous commit batching to evaluate latency, throughput, and conflict resolution effectiveness.\n5) Assess blockchain storage overhead, transaction costs, and audit trail integrity under load.\n6) Conduct stakeholder usability studies with scientists, editors, and legal experts to evaluate transparency, trust, and workflow integration.\n7) Benchmark against baseline centralized audit logging and public blockchain methods in terms of scalability, privacy preservation, and compliance verification soundness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A multi-author AI-assisted manuscript draft undergoing iterative AI suggestions, author edits, and compliance validations (e.g., plagiarism and ethical approvals). Authors locally generate cryptographic commitments and zero-knowledge proofs demonstrating compliance without disclosing manuscript content.\n\nExpected Output: The consortium blockchain records immutable, timestamped hashes and compliance proof attestations linked to each commit. Smart contracts validate proofs and update compliance status. An audit interface shows a verifiable trail of editing and compliance events accessible by publishers and regulators, enabling trust without revealing sensitive unpublished data.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If zero-knowledge proof overhead impairs performance, we will explore selective encryption and confidential multi-party computation techniques to balance privacy and efficiency. Should consortium blockchain scalability constraints arise, we will integrate scalable off-chain channels (e.g., state channels or sidechains) for high-frequency event batching, anchoring only essential commitments on-chain. Alternatively, a cryptographically signed centralized logging infrastructure with rigorous access and audit controls will be developed as an interim measure. Continuous engagement with consortium members will guide negotiation of operational trade-offs."

However, it lacks clarity on key technical challenges: How exactly will editing versions, AI generation events, and compliance validations be captured and structured for blockchain recording? How will the system handle latency or throughput limitations inherent in blockchain for real-time editing events? The link between blockchain transaction mechanisms and editorial workflows needs more precise detailing and justification to ensure system coherence and practicality. Clarifying these mechanisms will strengthen confidence in soundness and technical viability of the approach, particularly regarding synchronization, data granularity, and trust assumptions across stakeholders, as the problem demands stringent audit guarantees without impacting usability or workflow efficiency. Please provide an explicit design or architecture sketch explaining data flows, blockchain interaction points, and how smart contracts enforce legal compliance in a live environment with evolving AI-generated content and human edits, addressing scalability and update conflicts clearly within the Proposed_Method section."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the strong existing work linking blockchain and auditability, consider enhancing the idea by integrating privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques from the globally-linked concepts such as zero-knowledge proofs or differential privacy. For instance, zero-knowledge proofs can enable the system to verify compliance or provenance claims without revealing sensitive content, addressing privacy concerns in scientific publishing. Additionally, exploring post-quantum blockchain or consortium blockchain technology could improve scalability and security. Integrating these advanced cryptographic or distributed ledger concepts would elevate the proposal’s novelty and impact by addressing confidentiality, scalability, and security in a way not commonly combined with audit trails for AI scientific publications. This enhancement can be incorporated as a key design consideration or an extension in the Proposed_Method to position the work competitively."
