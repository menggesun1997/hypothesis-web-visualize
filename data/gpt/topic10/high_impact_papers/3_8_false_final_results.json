    "title": "Dynamic Compliance-Aware Model Updating via Continuous Legal Text Mining",
    "Problem_Statement": "AI systems lack mechanisms to adapt continuously to evolving regulations, risking non-compliance post-deployment and fragmented trustworthiness.",
    "Motivation": "Builds on the internal gap of incomplete integration of trustworthiness across lifecycle and external gap of weak linkages between regulatory changes and software implementation by leveraging continuous mining of legal frameworks to dynamically update AI modelsâ€™ compliance behaviors.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a continuous legal text mining pipeline that extracts updates from legal and regulatory documents and translates them into machine-interpretable compliance constraints. These constraints feed into AI model update modules triggering retraining, parameter adjustments, or behavior modifiers to maintain trustworthiness and governance compliance post-deployment.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build a corpus of evolving AI regulation documents. 2) Implement NLP pipelines for incremental change detection and semantic extraction. 3) Develop translators mapping legal changes to technical constraints. 4) Integrate constraints into mechanisms for automated model fine-tuning or adaptation. 5) Evaluate compliance adherence and system stability before/after regulation changes on standard NLP tasks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: New amendment in AI Act limiting use of biometric data. Output: Trigger automatic model update disabling biometric-based feature usage with audit report.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If fully automated mapping fails, apply human-in-the-loop validation for constraint extraction. If model adaptation destabilizes performance, incorporate staged validation and rollback strategies."
