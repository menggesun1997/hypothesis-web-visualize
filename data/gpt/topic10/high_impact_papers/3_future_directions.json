        "title": "Regulatory-Compliant Trustworthy AI Lifecycle Framework",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current AI systems lack comprehensive integration of regulatory and legal frameworks throughout their lifecycle, leading to fragmentation in trustworthiness approaches and challenges in ensuring compliance and societal acceptance.",
        "Motivation": "This work addresses the internal gap of fragmented trustworthiness approaches and external gap of weak integration of regulatory frameworks with AI software implementation lifecycle. By embedding compliance and governance systematically, it builds on High-Potential Innovation Opportunity 1 to enhance reliability and acceptance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel AI development lifecycle framework termed 'RegTrust-LC' (Regulatory-Trust Lifecycle Compliance) incorporating automated legal knowledge extraction from regulations like the Artificial Intelligence Act, a compliance-aware AI model training pipeline, and continuous auditing modules. The framework integrates natural language processing modules that parse legal texts to generate formal constraints and compliance checklists. AI software implementation is then constrained and monitored via these compliance artifacts ensuring embedded trustworthiness aspects such as fairness, privacy, and robustness during model development, deployment, and maintenance.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect dataset of AI regulatory documents including EU Artificial Intelligence Act. 2) Develop a legal text NLP parser to extract compliance clauses. 3) Implement compliance constraint generator mapping clauses to metrics like fairness and privacy. 4) Integrate constraints into model training pipelines for transformer-based NLP models (e.g., BERT, GPT variants). 5) Benchmark on standard datasets (e.g., GLUE, fairness benchmarks). 6) Evaluate compliance effectiveness through simulated audits and stakeholder surveys. Metrics: legal compliance coverage, fairness metrics, model accuracy, robustness under adversarial tests.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI model trained on facial recognition data with compliance constraints from GDPR and AI Act relating to privacy and fairness. Expected Output: Model outputs with certified documentation showing adherence to privacy standards, fairness across demographic groups, and audit logs capturing compliance checks.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If automated legal text parsing underperforms, fallback to manual expert-annotated compliance rules for initial experiments. If constraint-based training reduces model accuracy significantly, explore multi-objective optimization balancing compliance and performance. Employ explainability techniques to diagnose conflicts and iterate on constraint formulations."

If model compression harms response quality, explore lightweight prompt tuning or retrieval-augmented LLMs. User studies will help iterate interface adaptations."
