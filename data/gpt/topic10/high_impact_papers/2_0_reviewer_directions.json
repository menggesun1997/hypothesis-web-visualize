    "title": "Emotion-Adaptive Explainability Framework for LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current explainability methods for LLMs lack adaptability to varied user emotional and cognitive states, leading to ineffective trust-building and ethical understanding for diverse users.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap of limited assessment methodologies for explainability and lack of integration between user-centered design and technical explainability. Leverages the hidden bridge between recognition models and adaptive user interfaces to tailor explanations to emotional context.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an emotion-adaptive explainability framework that integrates real-time emotion recognition from user interactions with domain-adaptive XAI techniques. Using multimodal inputs (text and facial expression or voice tone), the framework customizes explanation complexity and style (e.g., causal, example-driven, narrative) to users' emotional states, enhancing comprehension and ethical awareness.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets combining NLP tasks with user emotion labels; 2) Implement baseline LLM with standard post-hoc XAI; 3) Develop emotion recognition module integrated with UI; 4) Combine with domain adaptation for explainability tailoring; 5) Evaluate on user trust, satisfaction, and explanation quality metrics using user studies and benchmark tasks; 6) Compare against static explainability models.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User interacts with a content moderation bot, recognized as frustrated via voice tone. The system provides a simplified, empathetic explanation of decisions with examples. Output: Explanation tailored to reduce frustration and increase clarity, e.g., 'I flagged your comment because certain words may violate our policy to keep conversations respectful.'",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If emotion recognition is noisy, fallback to generalized user profiles to select explanation styles. Alternatively, use explicit user feedback to adapt explanation preferences over time."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed experiment plan's steps are logically ordered and generally sound, but further details are needed to ensure feasibility and rigor. Specifically, collecting datasets that combine NLP tasks with labeled user emotions, including multimodal inputs (text, facial expressions, voice tone), is nontrivial and may require significant resources or novel data collection efforts. The plan should clarify the availability or creation of such data, and detail measures to address noise in emotion recognition and potential privacy concerns. Also, evaluation metrics for trust, satisfaction, and explanation quality need operational definitions and validated instruments. Without this, it risks challenges in reproducibility and conclusive results. Strengthening these aspects will improve experimental robustness and practicality of the methodology proposal to validate the framework effectively in real-world or controlled user studies, rather than remain conceptual or preliminary only at a proof-of-concept level. This refinement is crucial for gaining confidence in the framework’s applicability and performance claims in the competitive XAI and emotion recognition area where empirical rigor is a strong differentiator from novelty alone.\n\nSuggestion: Include plans for dataset sourcing/creation protocols, noise/privacy mitigation strategies, detailed metric definitions, and pilot study outlines to demonstrate feasibility before full user studies are conducted. This will elevate the experimental methodology from high-level outline to actionable, validated research design plans suitable for a premier conference submission and follow-up work phases. Furthermore, addressing these will improve reproducibility and impact assessment quality, critical for acceptance and community uptake of this interdisciplinary framework integrating emotional intelligence with explainability in LLMs.\n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "Given the 'NOV-COMPETITIVE' novelty assessment and the strong existing links between emotion recognition, explainability, and user adaptation, a concrete way to significantly enhance the research idea's impact and novelty is to explicitly integrate concepts from 'human-robot interaction' and 'technological transparency'. By extending the emotion-adaptive explainability framework beyond LLMs to embodied AI agents or robots that use language models, the research can address richer multimodal interactions and situational awareness in human-robot teams. Incorporating 'technological transparency' principles will also strengthen ethical understanding and trust-building by systematically linking explainability styles to transparency metrics and user mental models. \n\nThis broader framing would allow leveraging established evaluation metrics from HRI and transparency research, thus grounding evaluations in interdisciplinary standards. It would also open pathways to applications in domains like healthcare (e.g., 'pediatric mental health' or 'dementia care') where emotional adaptation in explanations can be especially impactful for vulnerable users. \n\nTherefore, I encourage the authors to consider expanding their framework’s scope and experimental validation to include situated interactive systems that combine LLMs with robotics or assistive agents, explicitly connecting to human-robot interaction literature and technological transparency theory. This integration can elevate the work beyond competitive novelty by situating it as a foundational building block for emotionally intelligent, transparent AI agents across modalities and domains.\n\nTarget Section: Motivation / Proposed_Method"
