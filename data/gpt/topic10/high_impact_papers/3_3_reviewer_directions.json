    "title": "Explainability-Driven Monitoring for Foundation Model Emergent Behaviors",
    "Problem_Statement": "Foundation models exhibit complex emergent behaviors that are poorly understood and difficult to monitor in deployed systems, posing risks for trustworthiness and safety.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of limited understanding and monitoring of emergent behaviors by creating explainability-driven monitoring frameworks that connect emergent model responses to human-understandable concepts and alerts, reducing siloed approaches in trustworthy AI system deployment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Propose an explainability-centric monitoring system for foundation models that combines concept activation vectors, counterfactual explanation generation, and continual behavioral clustering. The method detects shifts or anomalies in model behavior relative to baseline concept distributions and triggers interpretable diagnostics explaining cause and implications. This aligns with regulatory compliance by supporting auditability and transparency requirements.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement explainability modules on transformer-based foundation models. 2) Collect baseline behavior concept profiles on benchmark datasets. 3) Deploy models in simulated real-world scenarios with distribution shifts and adversarial inputs. 4) Evaluate detection accuracy of emergent behavior shifts, quality of generated explanations, and impact on end-user trust via human studies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Transformer model classifying news articles starts exhibiting bias towards certain topics. Monitoring system outputs explanation that increased activation of politically charged concepts caused classification drift, prompting model update.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If concept activation vectors are insufficient for interpretation, incorporate alternative methods such as SHAP or LIME. If monitoring introduces latency, develop lightweight approximation techniques or event-driven alerting only."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines combining concept activation vectors, counterfactual explanations, and behavioral clustering for monitoring foundation models, but lacks clarity on how these components integrate cohesively. Specifically, the mechanism by which shifts in concept activations translate into actionable, interpretable diagnostics is not fully detailed. Clarify the workflow, the criteria for anomaly detection, and how counterfactual explanations are generated and linked in real-time to behavioral clusters. Providing a schematic or algorithmic flow would enhance understanding and strengthen soundness of the methodology assumptions, enabling a clearer pathway from explainability to monitoring and alerting in deployment contexts. This will be crucial for reproducibility and evaluating the methodâ€™s effectiveness in practice, especially given the complexity of emergent behaviors in foundation models. Target the Proposed_Method section for elaboration and explicit detailing of integration steps among components involved in the system's pipeline."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the global concepts provided, a promising way to enhance both impact and novelty is integrating this explainability-driven monitoring framework within clinical decision support systems or biomedical informatics applications. These domains are particularly sensitive to trustworthy AI and emergent behavior risks. For example, adapting the system to monitor foundation models used for diagnostic predictions or personalized treatment recommendations could significantly expand societal impact and auditability. Additionally, incorporating human factors from mental health professionals or biomedical practitioners in the human studies phase would enrich evaluation and foster multidisciplinary collaboration. This cross-domain application could position the work distinctively while deepening the evaluation of trust and interpretability under high-stakes conditions, moving beyond narrow news classification and generic simulated scenarios. Hence, extend plans and examples to include biomedical or health informatics settings as a concrete path to broaden impact and novelty."
