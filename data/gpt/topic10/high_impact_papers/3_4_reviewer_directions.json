    "title": "Cross-Domain Bridge for AI Deployment in Healthcare Robotics via Policy-Aware LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "There exists a weak connection between software implementations of AI in robotics and healthcare policy frameworks, limiting adaptive AI solutions that are both resource-efficient and compliant in medical robotics.",
    "Motivation": "Exploits an external hidden bridge by uniting AI deployment, healthcare policy, and robotics through resource-aware LLM architectures to enable trustworthy medical robotic assistants, addressing siloed development in trustworthy AI, practical robotics, and healthcare policy.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a novel resource-aware conversational LLM framework embedded within assistive healthcare robots that dynamically adapts behavior based on encoded health policy constraints and real-time contextual user data. The system will fuse symbolic healthcare policy representations with neural LLM decision making to ensure ethical and compliant robotic actuation and communication.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect healthcare robotics interaction datasets annotated with policy and ethical guidelines. 2) Develop symbolic health policy encoders. 3) Implement hybrid LLM architecture integrating symbolic constraints. 4) Validate on simulated healthcare robot tasks (e.g., patient monitoring, assistance). 5) Measure compliance adherence, resource utilization, interaction naturalness, and patient trust metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient requests medication reminder robot to skip a dose due to health condition. Output: Robot confirms policy compliance by cross-checking guidelines and advises patient accordingly, articulating reasoning conversationally.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If symbolic integration is limited, fallback to reinforcement learning with policy-shaped reward signals to guide robot behaviors. If computational overhead is high, explore edge/cloud hybrid processing."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a hybrid LLM architecture that fuses symbolic healthcare policy representations with neural decision making, but lacks clarity on the concrete integration mechanism between symbolic encoders and the LLM's neural reasoning. You should explicitly detail the architecture design, the interfaces, and how the symbolic constraints influence LLM outputs in real time to establish trustworthiness and compliance, rather than describing the fusion at a conceptual level only. This clarity is critical for assessing the soundness and reproducibility of the approach, especially given the complexities of maintaining policy compliance in conversational robotics contexts where safety is paramount. Clarify also how policy ambiguities or conflicts are handled systematically in the decision-making process to avoid unsafe robotic actions or misleading communications to patients, reinforcing overall methodological soundness.

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the highly interdisciplinary domain, consider integrating concepts from 'deep reinforcement learning' and 'sim-to-real transfer' to complement your symbolic-LLM framework. For example, you could leverage reinforcement learning with policy-shaped reward signals (already mentioned in fallback) to adapt robot behavior dynamically in realistic, complex healthcare settings, enhancing adaptability beyond static policy encodings. Combining this with sim-to-real transfer methods could improve deployment feasibility in real-world healthcare environments where dynamic changes occur. Additionally, incorporating interactive 'graphical user interfaces' or 'XR systems' could facilitate better clinician oversight and human-in-the-loop corrections, broadening the impact and adoption potential of your system. This global integration of learning paradigms and interfaces is likely to elevate both the novelty and practical impact of your research idea. Target Section: Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan"
