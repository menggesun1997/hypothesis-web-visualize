They are viewed as the silver bullet for many applications, such as database integration, peer-to-peer systems, e-commerce, semantic web services, or social networks. However, in open or evolving systems, such as the semantic web, different parties would, in general, adopt different ontologies. Thus, merely using ontologies, like using XML, does not reduce heterogeneity: it just raises heterogeneity problems to a higher level. Euzenat and Shvaiko’s book is devoted to ontology matching as a solution to the semantic heterogeneity problem faced by computer systems. Ontology matching aims at finding correspondences between semantically related entities of different ontologies. These correspondences may stand for equivalence as well as other relations, such as consequence, subsumption, or disjointness, between ontology entities. Many different matching solutions have been proposed so far from various viewpoints, e.g., databases, information systems, and artificial intelligence. The second edition of Ontology Matching has been thoroughly revised and updated to reflect the most recent advances in this quickly developing area, which resulted in more than 150 pages of new content. In particular, the book includes a new chapter dedicated to the methodology for performing ontology matching. It also covers emerging topics, such as data interlinking, ontology partitioning and pruning, context-based matching, matcher tuning, alignment debugging, and user involvement in matching, to mention a few. More than 100 state-of-the-art matching systems and frameworks were reviewed. With Ontology Matching, researchers and practitioners will find a reference book that presents currently available work in a uniform framework. Inparticular, the work and the techniques presented in this book can be equally applied to database schema matching, catalog integration, XML schema matching and other related problems. The objectives of the book include presenting (i) the state of the art and (ii) the latest research results in ontology matching by providing a systematic and detailed account of matching techniques and matching systems from theoretical, practical and application perspectives.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'New Empirical Perspectives on Translation and Interpreting', 'abstract': 'iDrawing on work from both eminent and emerging scholars in translation and Interpreting Studies, this collection offers a critical reflection on current methodological practices in these fields toward strengthening the theoretical and empirical ties between them. Methodological and technological advances have pushed these respective areas of study forward in the last few decades, but advanced tools, such as eye tracking and keystroke logging, and insights from their use have often remained in isolation and not shared across disciplines. This volume explores empirical and theoretical challenges across these areas and the subsequent methodologies implemented to address them and how they might be mutually applied across translation and Interpreting Studies but also brought together toward a coherent empirical theory of translation and Interpreting Studies. Organised around three key themes—target-text orientedness, source-text orientedness and translator/interpreter-orientedness—the book takes stock of both studies of translation and interpreting corpora and processes in an effort to answer such key questions, including: how do written translation and interpreting relate to each other? How do technological advances in these fields shape process and product? What would an empirical theory of translation and Interpreting Studies look like? Taken together, the collection showcases the possibilities of further dialogue around methodological practices in translation and Interpreting Studies and will be of interest to students and scholars in these fields.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Springer Handbook of Science and Technology Indicators', 'abstract': 'This handbook presents the state of the art of quantitative methods and models to understand and assess the science and technology system. Focusing on various aspects of the development and application of indicators derived from data on scholarly publications, patents and electronic communications, the individual chapters, written by leading experts, discuss theoretical and methodological issues, illustrate applications, highlight their policy context and relevance, and point to future research directions. A substantial portion of the book is dedicated to detailed descriptions and analyses of data sources, presenting both traditional and advanced approaches. It addresses the main bibliographic metrics and indexes, such as the journal impact factor and the h-index, as well as altmetric and webometric indicators and science mapping techniques on different levels of aggregation and in the context of their value for the assessment of research performance as well as theirimpact on research policy and society. It also presents and critically discusses various national research evaluation systems. Complementing the sections reflecting on the science system, the technology section includes multiple chapters that explain different aspects of patent statistics, patent classification and database search methods to retrieve patent-related information. In addition, it examines the relevance of trademarks and standards as additional technological indicators. The Springer Handbook of Science and Technology Indicators is an invaluable resource for practitioners, scientists and policy makers wanting a systematic and thorough analysis of the potential and limitations of the various approaches to assess research and research performance.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'The Turn, Integration of Information Seeking and Retrieval in Context', 'abstract': 'T The Turn analyzes the research of information seeking and retrieval (IS&R) and proposes a new direction of integrating research in these two areas: the fields should turn off their separate and narrow paths and construct a new avenue of research. An essential direction for this avenue is context as given in the subtitle Integration of Information Seeking and Retrieval in Context. Other essential themes in the book include: IS&R research models, frameworks and theories; search and works tasks and situations in context; interaction between humans and machines; information acquisition, relevance and information use; research design and methodology based on a structured set of explicit variables - all set into the holistic cognitive approach. The present monograph invites the reader into a construction project - there is much research to do for a contextual understanding of IS&R. The Turn represents a wide-ranging perspective of IS&R by providing a novel unique research framework, covering both individual and social aspects of information behavior, including the generation, searching, retrieval and use of information. Regarding traditional laboratory information retrieval research, the monograph proposes the extension of research toward actors, search and work tasks, IR interaction and utility of information. Regarding traditional information seeking research, it proposes the extension toward information access technology and work task contexts. The Turn is the first synthesis of research in the broad area of IS&R ranging from systems oriented laboratory IR research to social science oriented information seeking studies.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing', 'abstract': 'In recent years, deep learning has fundamentally changed the landscapes of a number of areas in artificial intelligence, including speech, vision, natural language, robotics, and game playing.

    "current_research_landscape": "The core focus of this research cluster centers around leveraging empirical and theoretical frameworks to enable cross-domain knowledge integration, specifically evidenced by the central concepts of 'empirical theory', 'theory of translation', and 'ontology matching'. The cluster is composed of three thematic islands: (1) the 'contribution of citizen science' and its associated scientific and social actors, representing participatory knowledge generation; (2) methodological and theoretical approaches to translation and interpreting studies emphasizing empirical ties between disciplines; and (3) ontology and schema matching techniques that address semantic heterogeneity across distributed data and systems. The central problem the research community is addressing involves reconciling semantic, disciplinary, and methodological heterogeneity to facilitate effective knowledge transfer and integration across domains, which is critical for expanding NLP applications via large language models (LLMs). Dominant paradigms include ontology alignment for semantic interoperability, empirical and methodological rigor in translation and citizen science, and the use of recommendation and decision-support frameworks to contextualize and interpret knowledge across heterogeneous sources.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps prominently arise at the interface of empirical theory and ontology matching, notably reflecting challenges in bridging methodological rigor in translation studies with computational ontology alignment. There is a scarcity of unified empirical theories that deeply integrate semantic matching with human-centered translation and interpreting frameworks, limiting contextual adaptability and interpretability in cross-domain NLP. Additionally, citizen science contributions are underexplored in their potential to inform semantic interoperability and empirical methods, indicating a divide between participatory knowledge generation and computational formalizations.\n\nExternally, hidden bridges identified via global co-concept analysis suggest promising yet untapped opportunities: (1) Linking 'contribution of citizen science' with 'ontology matching' in areas like decision support systems, semantic web services, and contextual awareness hints at leveraging collective intelligence to improve semantic frameworks and LLM adaptability in real-world scenarios. (2) Integrating 'empirical ties' from translation studies with ontology matching in bioinformatics and genetics reflects an opportunity to fuse empirical human linguistic knowledge with automated semantic normalization, which could advance NLP-driven biomedical applications. (3) The intersection of 'contribution of citizen science' and 'empirical ties' highlighting social and political contexts (e.g., public demand, policy growth) indicates unexplored avenues for grounding LLM knowledge transfer in social science data and participatory frameworks, enhancing societal relevance and responsiveness.\n\nThese external gaps show that cross-disciplinary contextual embeddings and participatory data have been underutilized in ontology and empirical method development, limiting the scalability and domain generalization of current NLP approaches.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate participatory data and decision support methods from the 'contribution of citizen science' cluster (B2) with semantic ontology matching techniques informed by the 'hidden bridge' concepts around e-government, smart services, and context-awareness (C). This fusion could address the internal gap of limited human-contextual integration within computational semantic frameworks, enabling LLMs to better adapt to domain-specific, real-world nuances through collective intelligence.\n\nOpportunity 2: Develop a unified empirical-theoretical framework that combines methodological practices from translation and interpreting studies (B2), especially 'empirical ties' and 'theory of translation' (B3), with ontology matching approaches applied to biomedical semantics (C). This cross-disciplinary innovation can enhance explainability and accuracy in NLP applications for biomedical informatics, addressing the internal limitations of current semantic normalization methods.\n\nOpportunity 3: Exploit social science-informed empirical theories of citizen science contributions and public policy dynamics (C) to ground LLM knowledge transfer mechanisms in societal and political contexts. By linking social and demographic co-concepts with participatory research paradigms (B2), this direction could broaden NLP application horizons to better handle social complexity and inclusivity challenges, bridging current theoretical-methodological silos.\n\nTogether, these innovation opportunities synthesize local foundational research with global cross-disciplinary insights to propose novel paths for advancing LLM-enabled cross-domain knowledge transfer and NLP application diversity."
