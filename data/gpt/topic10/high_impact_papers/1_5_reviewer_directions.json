          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes integrating cognitive translation heuristics as constraints into ontology alignment optimization and leveraging reinforcement learning, but the mechanism lacks clarity in how these heuristics translate into formal constraints and how reinforcement learning policies operate over structured ontology data. More explicit operationalization of heuristics and the reinforcement learning framework, including state, action spaces, and reward design, is needed to validate soundness and reproducibility of the approach. Please provide a more detailed, formal specification of the hybrid model's architecture and the interaction between heuristics and learning components to ensure the approach is mathematically and empirically grounded and practically implementable given the complex linguistic phenomena involved, rather than a high-level conceptual description alone. This clarity is essential for soundness and feasibility assessments and meaningful comparisons with competitive baselines in ontology alignment and cognitive modeling literature, especially given the novelty screening's competitive context. Also clarify how explainability will be operationalized and quantified in this hybrid setting across cognitive and computational facets to solidify impact claims. This is the most critical foundation before proceeding to experimentation or benchmarking phases, as unclear mechanisms risk irreproducibility and limited scientific insight beyond heuristic-intuition layering which already exists in related research areas.

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed Experiment_Plan ambitiously spans corpus collection, formalization of heuristics, reinforcement learning training, and multifaceted evaluation, but lacks detailed operational plans that ensure feasibility. For example, it does not specify how bilingual corpora annotated with translation strategies will be obtained or whether existing resources suffice, which challenges the scale and quality of training data for reinforcement learning. The plan omits intermediate validation steps for cognitive constraint formalization and their integration into optimization, which are complex and nontrivial. Additionally, reinforcement learning for ontology alignment is computationally intensive and known for convergence instability; the fallback plan mentions alternative optimizers but without criteria for decision-making or comparisons of computational costs and expected performance trade-offs. Without concrete experimental milestones, risk mitigation strategies, and resource considerations, feasibility remains questionable. It is recommended to scaffold experiments incrementally, starting with heuristic constraint ablation studies and classical matching baselines before reinforcement learning, to confirm concept validity and facilitate debugging. Consider also clearer metric definitions and alignment with evaluation benchmarks to enable interpretable success measurement and reproducibility. Addressing these feasibility gaps is critical before large-scale deployment or claims of improved cognitive plausibility or downstream utility. Target section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan."
