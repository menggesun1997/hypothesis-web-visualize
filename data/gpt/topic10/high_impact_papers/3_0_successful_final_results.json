    "title": "Regulatory-Compliant Trustworthy AI Lifecycle Framework",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current AI systems lack comprehensive integration of regulatory and legal frameworks throughout their lifecycle, leading to fragmentation in trustworthiness approaches and challenges in ensuring compliance and societal acceptance.",
    "Motivation": "This work addresses the internal gap of fragmented trustworthiness approaches and external gap of weak integration of regulatory frameworks with AI software implementation lifecycle. By embedding compliance and governance systematically, it builds on High-Potential Innovation Opportunity 1 to enhance reliability and acceptance.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel AI development lifecycle framework termed 'RegTrust-LC' (Regulatory-Trust Lifecycle Compliance) incorporating automated legal knowledge extraction from regulations like the Artificial Intelligence Act, a compliance-aware AI model training pipeline, and continuous auditing modules. The framework integrates natural language processing modules that parse legal texts to generate formal constraints and compliance checklists. AI software implementation is then constrained and monitored via these compliance artifacts ensuring embedded trustworthiness aspects such as fairness, privacy, and robustness during model development, deployment, and maintenance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect dataset of AI regulatory documents including EU Artificial Intelligence Act. 2) Develop a legal text NLP parser to extract compliance clauses. 3) Implement compliance constraint generator mapping clauses to metrics like fairness and privacy. 4) Integrate constraints into model training pipelines for transformer-based NLP models (e.g., BERT, GPT variants). 5) Benchmark on standard datasets (e.g., GLUE, fairness benchmarks). 6) Evaluate compliance effectiveness through simulated audits and stakeholder surveys. Metrics: legal compliance coverage, fairness metrics, model accuracy, robustness under adversarial tests.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI model trained on facial recognition data with compliance constraints from GDPR and AI Act relating to privacy and fairness. Expected Output: Model outputs with certified documentation showing adherence to privacy standards, fairness across demographic groups, and audit logs capturing compliance checks.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If automated legal text parsing underperforms, fallback to manual expert-annotated compliance rules for initial experiments. If constraint-based training reduces model accuracy significantly, explore multi-objective optimization balancing compliance and performance. Employ explainability techniques to diagnose conflicts and iterate on constraint formulations."

        "title": "Regulatory-Compliant Trustworthy AI Lifecycle Framework with Human-Centered Organizational Trust in Clinical Decision Support",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current AI systems frequently suffer from fragmented trustworthiness approaches and inadequate integration of regulatory and legal frameworks throughout their lifecycle. This limitation is especially critical in high-stakes domains such as health systems, where regulatory compliance, organizational trust, and human-centered design jointly influence AI adoption and societal acceptance. Existing frameworks insufficiently address the dynamic interplay between evolving legal requirements, technical compliance enforcement, and stakeholder trust metrics, creating gaps that hinder dependable, widely accepted AI deployment in real-world clinical decision support scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Building on the recognition that trustworthy AI lifecycle governance often exists in silos, and given the NOV-COMPETITIVE verdict rooted in overlapping prior work, this research advances beyond current approaches by explicitly embedding algorithmic mechanisms for continuous, automated legal compliance enforcement paired with human-centered organizational trust modeling. By integrating AI-based clinical decision support systems within a holistic regulatory-trust lifecycle framework (RegTrust-LC+), the work incorporates participatory, human-centered design principles to map compliance artifacts to organizational trust and transparency outcomes. This integration addresses both internal fragmentation and external societal acceptance challenges, providing an interdisciplinary, end-to-end framework that enhances reliability, fairness, privacy, and robustness while dynamically adapting to evolving regulations and complex stakeholder requirements, thus positioning the work with high novelty and practical value over existing technical or policy-only proposals.",
        "Proposed_Method": "The enhanced RegTrust-LC+ framework employs a multi-layered architecture with three core modules: (1) Advanced Legal NLP Module that uses transformer-based models fine-tuned on jurisdiction-specific regulatory corpora, incorporating disambiguation heuristics and conflict resolution algorithms to extract, formalize, and continuously update compliance constraints from unstructured texts like the EU AI Act and GDPR. It systematically handles ambiguities and jurisdictional variations via context-aware regulatory ontologies and rule prioritization schemas. (2) Compliance-Aware AI Training Pipeline embeds these constraints into multi-objective optimization routines for model training, explicitly formalizing fairness, privacy, and robustness metrics as differentiable penalty functions, enabling quantitative balancing during transformer-based clinical decision support AI model development. Mechanistically, compliance artifacts serve as dynamic loss components and trigger constraint satisfaction monitoring throughout training iterations. (3) Continuous Compliance Auditing and Human-Centered Trust Module implements a lifecycle monitoring system that cross-validates model states against regulatory changes via incremental legal updates, automated compliance reporting, and traceable audit logging. Crucially, it incorporates participatory design workshops with clinicians, regulators, and patients to iteratively refine transparency and explainability modules, linking compliance metrics to organizational trust indicators, such as perceived fairness and decision interpretability. This interactive feedback loop integrates organizational trust modeling with technical compliance artifacts, fostering adoption in health systems. Algorithmic sketches detail formal constraint generation via semantic role labeling and rule extraction graphs, integration as constrained multi-objective learning with Lagrangian relaxation, and a dashboard for dynamic trust metric visualization tied to compliance status, ensuring reproducibility and robustness against regulatory drift.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate extensive multi-jurisdictional regulatory document dataset (EU AI Act, GDPR, US FDA guidelines) and clinical AI standards. 2) Develop and evaluate the Legal NLP Module with systematic ambiguity resolution and conflict handling benchmarks. 3) Formalize compliance constraints into mathematically rigorous representations and integrate them into transformer model training pipelines for clinical decision support tasks (e.g., diagnosis assistance from medical imaging or EHR). 4) Conduct multi-objective optimization experiments, examining trade-offs between accuracy, fairness, privacy, and robustness on clinical datasets (e.g., MIMIC-III, pathology images). 5) Develop and execute simulated continuous auditing with incremental legal updates to evaluate compliance maintenance. 6) Organize participatory design sessions with clinicians, regulators, and patients to co-design trust metrics and transparency interfaces. 7) Evaluate organizational trust and adoption potential through mixed-method stakeholder surveys, combined with quantitative compliance and model performance metrics. Metrics include legal compliance coverage, fairness across demographic groups, adversarial robustness, stakeholder trust scores, explainability quality, and audit trace completeness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical decision support AI model trained on multi-modal patient datasets constrained by automated compliance rules derived from GDPR (privacy), EU AI Act (risk management), and US FDA recommendations (safety). Expected Output: (i) Model outputs accompanied by continuously updated compliance certificates and audit logs; (ii) Demonstrable enforcement of privacy-preserving transformations and fairness-enhancing mechanisms with quantitative metrics (e.g., demographic parity difference < 0.05); (iii) Interactive transparency dashboard reflecting compliance adherence, trust scores from clinician feedback, and explainability reports for individual predictions; (iv) Dynamic adaptation to updated regulations without retraining from scratch, validated through simulated regulatory amendments; (v) Evidence from stakeholder assessments showing increased organizational trust and acceptance for model deployment in clinical workflows.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If automated legal text parsing achieves limited accuracy, hybrid approaches will combine machine extraction with expert-in-the-loop validation facilitating progressive improvement and semantic rule base bootstrapping. Should enforcing compliance constraints significantly degrade clinical model accuracy or robustness, adaptive multi-objective optimization will be refined using Pareto front analyses and dynamically weighted penalty terms. Explainability and trust metrics may be iteratively enhanced by deepening participatory design inputs and integrating domain-specific interpretability techniques. If continuous compliance monitoring encounters scalability challenges, the system will prioritize incremental monitoring for high-risk components and leverage modular microservices with asynchronous update pipelines. These strategies mitigate technical risks while preserving adoption potential, maintaining alignment with rigorous regulatory and human-centered trust requirements essential to high-stakes clinical contexts."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an ambitious framework integrating automated legal knowledge extraction with AI model training and auditing modules. However, key mechanism details are insufficiently elaborated. For instance, the process for transforming unstructured legal texts into actionable formal constraints lacks clarity on handling ambiguities, jurisdictional variations, and conflicting regulations. Additionally, the way these constraints concretely interface with complex model training pipelines (e.g., how fairness, privacy, and robustness metrics are quantitatively enforced or balanced) is not fully specified. Enhancing the mechanistic description will improve reproducibility and confidence in technical soundness. Consider providing algorithmic or architectural sketches illustrating the compliance artifact generation and integration steps in more depth, as well as anticipated challenges and mitigation strategies when aligning dynamic regulatory updates with evolving AI models and datasets in your lifecycle framework (RegTrust-LC). This will strengthen the reviewer's and community's trust in the feasibility and novelty of your approach at a fundamental level, beyond conceptual ambition to concrete execution feasibility and soundness evaluation margins within a competitive space that already focuses on trustworthy AI lifecycle governance integrations. Targeting explicit algorithmic mechanisms for continuous compliance validation may also differentiate the work and reduce potential pitfalls around ambiguous legal interpretations that undermine the enforcement capability of automated lifecycle monitoring modules described in the framework proposal. Overall, a deeper dive into the operational core of compliance embedding in model training and auditing modules is recommended before proceeding to experimental validation phases described in the plan, ensuring the foundation is rigorously established and justified prior to benchmarking efforts. This will prevent downstream technical risks and promote clearer impact realization in the trustworthiness and legal compliance AI intersection arena identified by your problem motivation and stated novelty context (NOV-COMPETITIVE). This feedback targets the Proposed_Method section to increase clarity, precision, and rigor of the underlying mechanism design to underpin the holistic lifecycle hypothesis and scalability claims put forth in the research idea submission form."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty screening verdict marking the idea as NOV-COMPETITIVE due to existing strong overlaps in trustworthy AI lifecycle and regulatory integration, a promising direction to elevate impact and novelty is to explicitly incorporate concepts from 'organisational trust' and 'human-centered design' into the framework. For example, integrating AI-based clinical decision support scenarios from the health system domain can serve as compelling testbeds where regulatory compliance and trustworthiness have critical real-world consequences. Embedding user-centric evaluation of trust and transparency, perhaps via participatory design involving domain experts like clinicians, regulators, and patients, can differentiate your RegTrust-LC approach by explicitly mapping technical compliance artifacts to stakeholder trust metrics and adoption outcomes. Leveraging advances in explainability paired with clinical AI tools and organizational trust modeling could add interdisciplinary novelty and practical value beyond existing purely technical or policy-oriented frameworks. This expansion could also diversify experiment benchmarks and impact measurements by including organisational and human factors alongside typical accuracy and fairness metrics, thus addressing societal acceptance challenges more holistically. By connecting your lifecycle framework with globally-linked concepts such as health system trust and human-centered design, you enhance both the research novelty and the societal importance of the work, addressing gaps in current fragmented approaches and fulfilling the stated motivation more comprehensively. This suggestion targets the overall framework's strategic positioning and potential experimental scope, aiming to boost competitive edge and broader system relevance."
