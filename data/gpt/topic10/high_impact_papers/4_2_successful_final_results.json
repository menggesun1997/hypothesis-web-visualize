    "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of interoperable software frameworks enabling transparent deployment, auditing, and community validation of LLM-driven human-in-the-loop psychological research tools.",

        "title": "Open-Source Modular Framework for Transparent LLM-Human Interactive Systems in Psychology with Integrated User Adoption Modeling",
        "Problem_Statement": "There exists a significant gap in interoperable, transparent software frameworks that facilitate not only the deployment and auditing of LLM-driven human-in-the-loop psychological research tools but also systematically evaluate user acceptance and adoption factors in real-world settings. This impedes reproducibility, transparency, and trust in digital psychological assessments leveraging natural language processing.",
        "Motivation": "While prior frameworks address deployment and auditing challenges, they often overlook the critical behavioral determinants influencing researcher and clinician adoption such as hedonic motivation, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy. Our approach advances the field by embedding technological transparency with behavioral modeling of usage intention, thereby uniquely combining engineering innovation and psychological theory. This dual focus addresses the competitive gap by promoting both transparent tool design and scientifically grounded user acceptance, critical for high-impact, reproducible applications in digital health technologies and psychological research.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an open-source, extendable modular framework comprising: (1) core components for LLM integration, human input interfaces, and ethical auditing tools with standardized, measurable auditing metrics (e.g., bias detection rates, emergent behavior assessments), (2) plugin architecture for flexible psychological task integration, (3) a structural equation modeling (SEM) module to operationalize and analyze determinants of users' intention including hedonic motivation, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy within natural language processing tasks, and (4) interactive dashboards delivering real-time audit reports and user perception feedback. This closed-loop system harnesses vast language data and user interaction logs to iteratively optimize both transparency and adoption. Comprehensive documentation and onboarding toolkits will support diverse expertise levels, ensuring broad accessibility and adoption in research labs.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Architect and implement baseline framework modules: LLM interface, human-computer interaction UI, ethical auditor with quantifiable metrics (e.g., accuracy of bias detection), and SEM-based usage intention analysis. 2. Develop evaluation benchmarks for auditing tools using annotated datasets reflecting emergent behaviors and known biases. 3. Integrate case study psychological tasks such as language-based depression severity assessment, incorporating user and ethicist feedback. 4. Conduct iterative user studies with diverse researchers and clinicians to validate usability, transparency, and auditing effectiveness, measuring key outcomes: researcher engagement metrics, interpretability scores, and usage intention predictors derived from SEM models. 5. Implement contingency protocols addressing plugin interoperability failures and auditing algorithm robustness, including fallback to external auditing tools and streamlined starter kits for common tasks. 6. Roll out an open beta program emphasizing community-driven refinement informed by real-world deployments, supported by comprehensive onboarding materials to mitigate adoption barriers.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A clinical researcher uploads a large dataset of patient language samples for automated depression severity estimation. Output: The framework presents an interactive UI with real-time, model-generated explanations for each case, detailed ethical audit reports with quantitative bias and emergent behavior metrics, and SEM-driven insights on researcher’s hedonic motivation and effort expectancy influencing their trust and acceptance of the system. Feedback loops allow human annotators and ethicists to provide annotations seamlessly, coordinating improvements in model transparency and adoption parameters.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the complexity of modular integration challenges usability, develop targeted simplified 'starter kits' with pre-configured modules focusing on critical psychological tasks and auditing features to lower adoption barriers. If auditing accuracy or robustness is insufficient, incorporate validated external auditing tools alongside internal metrics for triangulation and cross-validation. For SEM modules, if data assumptions do not hold, fallback to alternative behavioral modeling approaches with simplified predictors and enhanced user surveys. Enhanced onboarding documentation and support materials will mitigate expertise gaps early in deployment."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan presents an ambitious development and evaluation sequence; however, it lacks detail on evaluation metrics and benchmarks for auditing tools and psychological task integration, which are critical for assessing feasibility and success. The plan should explicitly incorporate iterative user studies with target researcher communities to validate usability, transparency, and effectiveness of auditing dashboards. Additionally, contingency mechanisms for technical integration challenges, especially in plugin interoperability and ethical auditing algorithm robustness, need elaboration to bolster feasibility confidence. Clarifying these will make the experimental roadmap more scientifically robust and practical for deployment in real-world psychological research settings, ensuring incremental validation rather than solely engineering milestones. Thus, a revision incorporating these points is necessary before full-scale development proceeds, to increase the likelihood of a successful, community-adopted framework implementation and evaluation cycle in psychology research contexts, where stakes are high for transparency and reproducibility standards (e.g., explicitly measurable auditing success criteria, researcher engagement metrics, and model interpretability validation). Implied assumptions about developer and user expertise levels should also be addressed with targeted onboarding or documentation strategies within the plan to mitigate adoption risk early on, thereby enhancing the plan's realism and preparedness for typical deployment environments in psychological science labs or collaborative projects with human annotators and ethicists involved."

          "feedback_content": "To strengthen the competitiveness and scientific impact of this transparent LLM-human interactive system framework in psychology, I recommend integrating aspects of 'technological transparency' and 'determinants of users’ intention' from the globally-linked concepts. Specifically, the framework could incorporate structural equation modeling modules to analyze how hedonic motivation, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy influence researchers’ and clinicians' intention to adopt and trust the system. This integration would not only provide data-driven insights into user acceptance within psychological research workflows but also guide iterative design improvements to maximize usability and transparency. Further, linking usage intention predictors with real-time audit reports and interactive perception interfaces could create a closed feedback loop that scientifically advances understanding of human-AI interaction acceptance factors in digital health technologies. Embedding these models within the open-source platform would differentiate the framework from competitors by combining both engineering and behavioral science innovations, ultimately amplifying both academic novelty and practical impact in digital psychological assessment and intervention research."
