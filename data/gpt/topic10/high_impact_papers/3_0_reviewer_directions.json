    "title": "Regulatory-Compliant Trustworthy AI Lifecycle Framework",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current AI systems lack comprehensive integration of regulatory and legal frameworks throughout their lifecycle, leading to fragmentation in trustworthiness approaches and challenges in ensuring compliance and societal acceptance.",
    "Motivation": "This work addresses the internal gap of fragmented trustworthiness approaches and external gap of weak integration of regulatory frameworks with AI software implementation lifecycle. By embedding compliance and governance systematically, it builds on High-Potential Innovation Opportunity 1 to enhance reliability and acceptance.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel AI development lifecycle framework termed 'RegTrust-LC' (Regulatory-Trust Lifecycle Compliance) incorporating automated legal knowledge extraction from regulations like the Artificial Intelligence Act, a compliance-aware AI model training pipeline, and continuous auditing modules. The framework integrates natural language processing modules that parse legal texts to generate formal constraints and compliance checklists. AI software implementation is then constrained and monitored via these compliance artifacts ensuring embedded trustworthiness aspects such as fairness, privacy, and robustness during model development, deployment, and maintenance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect dataset of AI regulatory documents including EU Artificial Intelligence Act. 2) Develop a legal text NLP parser to extract compliance clauses. 3) Implement compliance constraint generator mapping clauses to metrics like fairness and privacy. 4) Integrate constraints into model training pipelines for transformer-based NLP models (e.g., BERT, GPT variants). 5) Benchmark on standard datasets (e.g., GLUE, fairness benchmarks). 6) Evaluate compliance effectiveness through simulated audits and stakeholder surveys. Metrics: legal compliance coverage, fairness metrics, model accuracy, robustness under adversarial tests.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI model trained on facial recognition data with compliance constraints from GDPR and AI Act relating to privacy and fairness. Expected Output: Model outputs with certified documentation showing adherence to privacy standards, fairness across demographic groups, and audit logs capturing compliance checks.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If automated legal text parsing underperforms, fallback to manual expert-annotated compliance rules for initial experiments. If constraint-based training reduces model accuracy significantly, explore multi-objective optimization balancing compliance and performance. Employ explainability techniques to diagnose conflicts and iterate on constraint formulations."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-MECHANISM",
          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an ambitious framework integrating automated legal knowledge extraction with AI model training and auditing modules. However, key mechanism details are insufficiently elaborated. For instance, the process for transforming unstructured legal texts into actionable formal constraints lacks clarity on handling ambiguities, jurisdictional variations, and conflicting regulations. Additionally, the way these constraints concretely interface with complex model training pipelines (e.g., how fairness, privacy, and robustness metrics are quantitatively enforced or balanced) is not fully specified. Enhancing the mechanistic description will improve reproducibility and confidence in technical soundness. Consider providing algorithmic or architectural sketches illustrating the compliance artifact generation and integration steps in more depth, as well as anticipated challenges and mitigation strategies when aligning dynamic regulatory updates with evolving AI models and datasets in your lifecycle framework (RegTrust-LC). This will strengthen the reviewer's and community's trust in the feasibility and novelty of your approach at a fundamental level, beyond conceptual ambition to concrete execution feasibility and soundness evaluation margins within a competitive space that already focuses on trustworthy AI lifecycle governance integrations. Targeting explicit algorithmic mechanisms for continuous compliance validation may also differentiate the work and reduce potential pitfalls around ambiguous legal interpretations that undermine the enforcement capability of automated lifecycle monitoring modules described in the framework proposal. Overall, a deeper dive into the operational core of compliance embedding in model training and auditing modules is recommended before proceeding to experimental validation phases described in the plan, ensuring the foundation is rigorously established and justified prior to benchmarking efforts. This will prevent downstream technical risks and promote clearer impact realization in the trustworthiness and legal compliance AI intersection arena identified by your problem motivation and stated novelty context (NOV-COMPETITIVE). This feedback targets the Proposed_Method section to increase clarity, precision, and rigor of the underlying mechanism design to underpin the holistic lifecycle hypothesis and scalability claims put forth in the research idea submission form."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty screening verdict marking the idea as NOV-COMPETITIVE due to existing strong overlaps in trustworthy AI lifecycle and regulatory integration, a promising direction to elevate impact and novelty is to explicitly incorporate concepts from 'organisational trust' and 'human-centered design' into the framework. For example, integrating AI-based clinical decision support scenarios from the health system domain can serve as compelling testbeds where regulatory compliance and trustworthiness have critical real-world consequences. Embedding user-centric evaluation of trust and transparency, perhaps via participatory design involving domain experts like clinicians, regulators, and patients, can differentiate your RegTrust-LC approach by explicitly mapping technical compliance artifacts to stakeholder trust metrics and adoption outcomes. Leveraging advances in explainability paired with clinical AI tools and organizational trust modeling could add interdisciplinary novelty and practical value beyond existing purely technical or policy-oriented frameworks. This expansion could also diversify experiment benchmarks and impact measurements by including organisational and human factors alongside typical accuracy and fairness metrics, thus addressing societal acceptance challenges more holistically. By connecting your lifecycle framework with globally-linked concepts such as health system trust and human-centered design, you enhance both the research novelty and the societal importance of the work, addressing gaps in current fragmented approaches and fulfilling the stated motivation more comprehensively. This suggestion targets the overall framework's strategic positioning and potential experimental scope, aiming to boost competitive edge and broader system relevance."
