The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Using large language models in psychology', 'abstract': 'Large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google’s Bard or Meta’s LLaMa, have created unprecedented opportunities for analysing and generating language data on a massive scale. Because language data have a central role in all areas of psychology, this new technology has the potential to transform the field. In this Perspective, we review the foundations of LLMs. We then explain how the way that LLMs are constructed enables them to effectively generate human-like linguistic output without the ability to think or feel like a human. We argue that although LLMs have the potential to advance psychological measurement, experimentation and practice, they are not yet ready for many of the most transformative psychological applications — but further research and development may enable such use. Next, we examine four major concerns about the application of LLMs to psychology, and how each might be overcome. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for investments that could help to address these concerns: field-initiated ‘keystone’ datasets; increased standardization of performance benchmarks; and shared computing and analysis infrastructure to ensure that the future of LLM-powered research is equitable.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Forecasting: theory and practice', 'abstract': 'Forecasting has always been at the forefront of decision making and planning. The uncertainty that surrounds the future is both exciting and challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise risks and maximise utilities. The large number of forecasting applications calls for a diverse set of forecasting methods to tackle real-life challenges. This article provides a non-systematic review of the theory and the practice of forecasting. We provide an overview of a wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles, and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety of real-life contexts. We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and applications. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of forecasting theory and practice. Given its encyclopedic nature, the intended mode of reading is non-linear. We offer cross-references to allow the readers to navigate through the various topics. We complement the theoretical concepts and applications covered by large lists of free or open-source software implementations and publicly-available databases.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Springer Handbook of Robotics', 'abstract': 'The second edition of this handbook provides a state-of-the-art cover view on the various aspects in the rapidly developing field of robotics. Reaching for the human frontier, robotics is vigorously engaged in the growing challenges of new emerging domains. Interacting, exploring, and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly touch people and their lives. The credible prospect of practical robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics as a modern scientific discipline. The ongoing vibrant expansion and strong growth of the field during the last decade has fueled this second edition of the Springer Handbook of Robotics. The first edition of the handbook soon became a landmark in robotics publishing and won the American Association of Publishers PROSE Award for Excellence in Physical Sciences & Mathematics as well as the organization’s Award for Engineering & Technology. The second edition of the handbook, edited by two internationally renowned scientists with the support of an outstanding team of seven part editors and more than 200 authors, continues to be an authoritative reference for robotics researchers, newcomers to the field, and scholars from related disciplines. The contents have been restructured to achieve four main objectives: the enlargement of foundational topics for robotics, the enlightenment of design of various types of robotic systems, the extension of the treatment on robots moving in the environment, and the enrichment of advanced robotics applications. Further to an extensive update, fifteen new chapters have been introduced on emerging topics, and a new generation of authors have joined the handbook’s team. A novel addition to the second edition is a comprehensive collection of multimedia references to more than 700 videos, which bring valuable insight into the contents. The videos can be viewed directly augmented into the text with a smartphone or tablet using a unique and specially designed app.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology', 'abstract': 'The Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology (ESST) addresses the grand challenge for science and engineering today.

The first goal is meta-theoretical and is fulfilled by Part One: an interpretation of the past (Chapter 1), the present (Chapter 2), and the future of AI (Chapter 3). Part One develops the thesis that AI is an unprecedented divorce between agency and intelligence. On this basis, Part Two investigates the consequences of such a divorce, developing the thesis that AI as a new form of agency can be harnessed ethically and unethically. Chapter 4 offers a unified perspective on the many principles that have been proposed to frame the ethics of AI. Chapter 5 discusses the potential risks that may undermine the application of these principles, and then Chapter 6 analyses the relation between ethical principles and legal norms, and offers a definition of soft ethics as post-compliance ethics. Chapters 7–9 analyse the ethical challenges caused by the development and use of AI, evil uses of AI, and good practices when applying AI. The last group of chapters focuses on AI for social good or AI4SG (Chapter 10), the positive and negative impacts of AI on the environment (Chapter 11), and the possibility of using AI in support of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (Chapter 12).The book concludes (Chapter 13) by arguing in favour of a new marriage between the Green of all our habitats and the Blue of all our digital technologies and how this new marriage can support and develop a better society and a healthier biosphere.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Handbook of Research on Science Education', 'abstract': 'Volume III of this landmark synthesis of research offers a comprehensive, state-of-the-art survey highlighting new and emerging research perspectives in science education.

Each chapter has been updated with new research and new content, and Volume III has been further developed to include new and expanded coverage on astronomy and space education, epistemic practices related to socioscientific issues, design-based research, interdisciplinary and STEM education, inclusive science education, and the global impact of nature of science and scientific inquiry literacy. As with the previous volumes, Volume III is organized around six themes: theory and methods of science education research; science learning; diversity and equity; science teaching; curriculum and assessment; and science teacher education. Each chapter presents an integrative review of the research on the topic it addresses, pulling together the existing research, working to understand historical trends and patterns in that body of scholarship, describing how the issue is conceptualized within the literature, how methods and theories have shaped the outcomes of the research, and where the strengths, weaknesses, and gaps are in the literature.

We call these models foundation models to\\nunderscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report\\nprovides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation\\nmodels, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics,\\nreasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model\\narchitectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation,\\ntheory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal\\nimpact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and\\nethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep\\nlearning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent\\ncapabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes\\nhomogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution,\\nas the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models\\ndownstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models,\\nwe currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and\\nwhat they are even capable of due to their emergent properties.

However, the widespread use of LLMs is also coupled with significant ethical and social challenges. Previous research has pointed towards auditing as a promising governance mechanism to help ensure that AI systems are designed and deployed in ways that are ethical, legal, and technically robust. However, existing auditing procedures fail to address the governance challenges posed by LLMs, which display emergent capabilities and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. In this article, we address that gap by outlining a novel blueprint for how to audit LLMs. Specifically, we propose a three-layered approach, whereby governance audits (of technology providers that design and disseminate LLMs), model audits (of LLMs after pre-training but prior to their release), and application audits (of applications based on LLMs) complement and inform each other. We show how audits, when conducted in a structured and coordinated manner on all three levels, can be a feasible and effective mechanism for identifying and managing some of the ethical and social risks posed by LLMs. However, it is important to remain realistic about what auditing can reasonably be expected to achieve. Therefore, we discuss the limitations not only of our three-layered approach but also of the prospect of auditing LLMs at all. Ultimately, this article seeks to expand the methodological toolkit available to technology providers and policymakers who wish to analyse and evaluate LLMs from technical, ethical, and legal perspectives.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'The SAGE Handbook of Social Media', 'abstract': 'In terms of media and communication history, we are arguably in the midst of a social media paradigm.

    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem addressed by this research cluster is the advancement and application of Large Language Models (LLMs) and associated technologies within psychology and related fields to improve psychological measurement, language data analysis, and psychological applications, all while integrating human expertise effectively ('human-in-the-loop'). The core focus areas, as represented by central nodes, include psychological measures, language data, and state-of-the-art modeling techniques. The thematic islands show concentrated efforts in psychology-related language applications, software and open-source implementations for model deployment and evaluation, robotics and advanced robotic applications, and digital transformation within organizations, notably in the IT industry. Dominant approaches are interdisciplinary, leveraging state-of-the-art LLM architectures trained on broad datasets (foundation models), combined with software implementations and open-source tools. Methodologies reflect encyclopedic reviews, empirical psychological study enhancements using LLMs, and robotic system development to interface with humans for practical applications. Ethical, legal, and transparency considerations are also foundational to these efforts.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps include limitations in the readiness of current LLMs for transformative psychological applications due to incomplete understanding of model capabilities, emergent failures, and biases linked to training data, as highlighted in foundational papers. The bridge nodes (advanced robotic applications and practical robots) indicate weak integration between robotic system developments and psychological applications or software deployment methods, denoting an underexplored interdisciplinary interface. Furthermore, auditing LLMs comprehensively remains challenging due to emergent behaviors and adaptability concerns, calling for novel governance mechanisms. Externally, the 'Hidden Bridges' analysis reveals promising interdisciplinary linkages absent in the focal literature. For example, integrating software implementations with psychological areas through quality improvement methodologies (QI), measurement-based care, and self-management tools suggests untapped potential for enhancing psychological measures with systemized, implementation science frameworks. Similarly, connecting psychological domains with practical robots via social robotics and moral agency concepts could innovate interactive hypothesis testing by embedding adaptive human-robot dialogue and emotional scenario modeling—advancing human-in-the-loop systems. Also, linking software implementations with practical robot research offers bridges to human-centered computing advances, such as gaze tracking and collaborative robots, enriching interactive hypothesis testing environments. These connections are not sufficiently addressed in the current cluster, representing novel frontiers for development.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate 'measurement-based care' and 'quality improvement methodologies' (from the bridge between 'areas of psychology' and 'software implementation') into LLM-driven psychological assessment models to address current gaps in standardization and benchmarking, thereby improving accuracy, robustness, and human oversight in psychological applications. This fusion leverages implementation science to overcome limitations in LLM readiness and reliability presented in the foundational papers.\n\nOpportunity 2: Develop human-in-the-loop interactive hypothesis testing platforms by combining insights from 'social robots' and 'moral agency' (bridging 'areas of psychology' and 'practical robots') with LLM natural language capabilities to create affect-aware, ethically governed robotic interfaces. This approach tackles internal integration gaps and extends psychological experimental paradigms through embodied AI agents capable of nuanced human interaction and real-time feedback.\n\nOpportunity 3: Leverage advances in 'human-robot interaction research' and 'design software architecture' (from the bridge between 'software implementation' and 'practical robots') to build modular, open-source frameworks enabling seamless deployment of interactive LLM-powered systems in psychological research contexts. This addresses both technical model deployment challenges and the ethical/legal auditing concerns raised, fostering transparency, adaptability, and community-driven validation in the rapidly evolving foundation model landscape."
