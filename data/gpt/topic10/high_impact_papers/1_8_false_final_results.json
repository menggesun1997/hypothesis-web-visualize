    "title": "Multimodal Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer Leveraging Citizen Science and Translation Empirical Data",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current cross-domain knowledge transfer via LLMs lacks multimodal grounding that synergizes human participatory data and empirical translation insights, limiting transfer effectiveness in complex NLP domains.",
    "Motivation": "Innovatively integrates participatory data and empirical linguistic knowledge from translation studies into a unified multimodal framework, addressing internal and external gaps simultaneously for richer, more generalizable knowledge transfer.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multimodal transfer architecture combining textual (from translation studies) and participatory image/audio data to build enriched semantic representations that inform LLM fine-tuning for cross-domain applications respecting human context and domain specificity.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect paired textual and participatory multimedia datasets. 2. Extract multimodal embeddings aligned with translation linguistic features. 3. Train LLM adapters integrating these embeddings. 4. Evaluate on multimodal cross-domain NLP tasks (e.g., multimodal question answering). 5. Metrics: multimodal retrieval accuracy, transfer learning efficacy, explainability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A citizen science photo annotated with translation-rich textual metadata. Expected Output: Enhanced LLM understanding with accurate semantic cross-domain knowledge reflected in richer responses.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal fusion underperforms, experiment with modular architectures allowing separate unimodal fine-tuning followed by late fusion."
