        "title": "Adaptive Multimodal Self-Management Platform for Psychological and Chronic Care Leveraging LLM-Driven Quality Improvement Feedback Loops",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current self-management tools in psychological and chronic care domains lack a transparent, dynamic, and clinically integrated mechanism that leverages LLM-driven Quality Improvement (QI) feedback cycles. This limits personalized adaptability and raises safety concerns, reducing efficacy across diverse patient populations and care pathways.",
        "Motivation": "Despite advances in digital health, existing platforms insufficiently integrate rigorous QI methodologies with real-time multimodal personalization, limiting their clinical impact and scalability. By embedding an explicit, clinician-inclusive LLM reasoning mechanism and incorporating established usability assessment frameworks, this proposal innovates at the intersection of AI-driven adaptation, psychological and chronic disease care (e.g., mood disorders, ADHD, chronic rheumatic diseases), and user-centered design, thereby addressing recognized gaps and enhancing both novelty and generalizability.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose designing a patient-centered digital self-management platform integrating LLM modules operating within an explicit feedback architecture that unifies user-reported outcomes, clinician inputs, and multimodal signals (including stress markers via wearable sensors and smart glasses). The architecture specifies: 1) Data Flow—daily user inputs (journals, medication adherence), physiological and behavioral sensor streams are securely collected; 2) LLM Reasoning Engine—processes aggregated data to identify trends and infer personalized care adaptations; 3) QI Feedback Loop—informed by clinician evaluations via an integrated dashboard that analyses LLM recommendations, clinicians provide approval, refinement, or override instructions; 4) Update Mechanism—LLM fine-tunes motivational prompts, care plan suggestions, and adaptive feedback iteratively. Usability and engagement are rigorously quantified with the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire across diverse patient populations including mood and chronic rheumatic disorders as well as ADHD. This multimodal, extensible platform is designed for ethical and clinical safety, transparency, and adaptability, hence raising the standard for digital psychological and chronic care self-management.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop the multimodal self-management platform incorporating LLM, wearable sensor data ingestion (e.g., stress detection via smart glasses), and clinician-integrated QI dashboards. 2. Recruit diverse patient cohorts spanning mood disorders, ADHD, and chronic rheumatic diseases. 3. Implement baseline usability assessments using the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire. 4. Collect longitudinal self-reported, sensor, and clinician feedback data over 6 months. 5. Measure changes in symptom trajectories, patient engagement, care plan adaptation accuracy, and usability metrics. 6. Analyze the LLM's decision-making transparency and clinician feedback concordance. 7. Refine platform modules based on aggregated insights to iteratively improve model and clinical integration.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A patient with a mood disorder records daily mood fluctuations and medication adherence via app; simultaneously, stress levels are monitored through smart glasses sensors. The LLM synthesizes textual and physiological data, identifying early signs of relapse risk. It generates adaptive motivational prompts and care plan modifications, which are reviewed and adjusted by clinicians through the QI feedback dashboard. In another case, an ADHD patient’s behavioral inputs and clinician feedback are integrated to personalize focus-enhancing interventions and dynamically adapt reminders, demonstrating platform generalizability across conditions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time LLM adaptation with clinician-in-the-loop feedback proves technically or clinically unstable, the system will revert to scheduled batch processing cycles where LLM-generated recommendations undergo periodic clinician review before deployment. Should patient engagement decline, targeted usability improvements including gamification elements informed by mHealth App Usability Questionnaire findings will be introduced. Alternative multimodal signals or reduced sensor dependencies may be evaluated to optimize user burden and data reliability."

Specifically, the mechanism by which user-reported outcomes are transformed into actionable adaptations through LLM reasoning and clinician input needs elaboration. Clarify the model architecture, data flow, and decision-making process to strengthen methodological soundness and reproducibility, ensuring confidence in the adaptive personalization process described in the proposal's Method section and illustrated via Test_Case_Examples. Without this, assumptions about effective dynamic adaptation remain unvalidated and risky for deployment in psychological care contexts requiring high ethical and clinical standards, consistent with the Problem_Statement's claims and Motivations goals to innovate care through bridging software and psychological domains efficiently and safely."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment, you could enhance both impact and differentiation by integrating established patient engagement and usability measurement methods, such as the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire, to rigorously quantify and improve user experience. Additionally, expanding use cases beyond mood disorders to include chronic conditions (e.g., chronic rheumatic diseases) or neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD could broaden the scope and real-world applicability, tapping into diverse patient pathways where adaptive self-management and digital health technologies hold high potential. Incorporating stress detection models or adaptive feedback via smart glasses could also introduce multimodal input/output paths, refining personalization and reinforcing the embedded QI strategy as a generalizable platform rather than a narrowly focused app, thus addressing both impact and novelty concerns."
