    "title": "Framework for Embodied Emotional Scenario Modeling in LLM-Driven Human-Robot Dialogue",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current systems lack sophisticated emotional scenario modeling to support nuanced, adaptive human-robot dialogue in psychological hypothesis testing.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external multidisciplinary gap connecting psychological domains with practical robotics through social robotics and affect-aware systems (Opportunity 2), enabling richer interactive scientific inquiry.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-agent emotional simulation engine coupled with LLM dialogue generation that models layered emotional states of both human and robot agents in real-time, dynamically influencing conversational flow and hypothesis generation plausibility.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Formalize emotional scenario ontology for psychological relevance. 2. Integrate real-time emotion recognition. 3. Train LLMs conditioned on emotional scenario states. 4. Test in interactive experiments involving complex emotional stimuli. 5. Assess hypothesis testing improvements and ecological validity.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Participant is induced to feel anxiety; robot senses and simulates matching emotional state, adapting dialogue to explore coping hypotheses collaboratively.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time modeling is computationally intractable, precompute key emotional trajectories for reuse or simplify emotion representation granularity. Explore rule-based fallback logic."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an innovative integration of multi-agent emotional simulation with LLM dialogue generation. However, the mechanism lacks sufficient clarity on how the emotional states are represented, updated, and how these states concretely influence the LLM's dialogue generation process in real-time. Clarify the architecture and data flow between the emotional engine and dialogue modules, including whether emotional signals are discrete, continuous, or probabilistic, and how these signals condition or bias the LLM responses. This will strengthen the soundness of the design and make it easier to evaluate and reproduce the approach reliably, which is crucial given the complexity and novelty of layered emotional state modeling in dynamic interactions with both robot and human agents concurrently. Consider adding preliminary formal definitions or a modular design diagram to enhance transparency and rigor of the mechanism design, thereby solidifying underlying assumptions and feasibility arguments."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "While the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is thorough and methodical, it may underestimate challenges in real-time emotion recognition integration and LLM conditioning within interactive experiments under ecologically valid emotional stimuli. Steps like 'train LLMs conditioned on emotional scenario states' and 'test in interactive experiments involving complex emotional stimuli' require more explicit consideration of computational cost, model adaptability to noisy and ambiguous emotional cues, and iterative validation protocols. To improve feasibility, expand the experiment plan with contingency measures such as intermediate validation benchmarks on emotion recognition accuracy, simulations or pilot studies with simplified scenarios, and quantitative metrics for dialogue adaptation quality. Further detail on dataset sources, annotation standards for emotional states, and plans for ecological validity evaluation will enhance scientific rigor and make the experimental approach more feasible and replicable."
