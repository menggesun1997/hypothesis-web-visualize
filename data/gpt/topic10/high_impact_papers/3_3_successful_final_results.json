    "Problem_Statement": "Foundation models exhibit complex emergent behaviors that are poorly understood and difficult to monitor in deployed systems, posing risks for trustworthiness and safety.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of limited understanding and monitoring of emergent behaviors by creating explainability-driven monitoring frameworks that connect emergent model responses to human-understandable concepts and alerts, reducing siloed approaches in trustworthy AI system deployment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Propose an explainability-centric monitoring system for foundation models that combines concept activation vectors, counterfactual explanation generation, and continual behavioral clustering. The method detects shifts or anomalies in model behavior relative to baseline concept distributions and triggers interpretable diagnostics explaining cause and implications. This aligns with regulatory compliance by supporting auditability and transparency requirements.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement explainability modules on transformer-based foundation models. 2) Collect baseline behavior concept profiles on benchmark datasets. 3) Deploy models in simulated real-world scenarios with distribution shifts and adversarial inputs. 4) Evaluate detection accuracy of emergent behavior shifts, quality of generated explanations, and impact on end-user trust via human studies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Transformer model classifying news articles starts exhibiting bias towards certain topics. Monitoring system outputs explanation that increased activation of politically charged concepts caused classification drift, prompting model update.",

        "title": "Explainability-Driven Monitoring for Foundation Model Emergent Behaviors in Clinical Decision Support Systems",
        "Problem_Statement": "Foundation models integrated into high-stakes clinical decision support systems exhibit complex emergent behaviors that are difficult to detect and interpret in real-time, risking patient safety, trustworthiness, and regulatory compliance. These unpredictable behaviors may lead to erroneous diagnostic or treatment recommendations, rendering current monitoring approaches insufficient for ensuring reliable AI deployment in biomedical settings.",
        "Motivation": "While foundation models offer transformative potential in biomedical informatics, their opaque emergent behaviors create critical trust and safety challenges, especially in clinical domains where errors can be life-threatening. Current monitoring solutions often lack cohesive integration of explainability techniques resulting in limited actionable insights and insufficient auditability. Our approach addresses this gap by proposing an integrated, explainability-driven monitoring framework specialized for clinical decision support applications. By bridging explainability and monitoring through real-time detection and interpretable diagnostics linked explicitly to human-understandable clinical concepts, we aim to enhance transparency, enable timely interventions, and satisfy stringent healthcare regulatory standards. This integration into clinical settings, enriched with mental health and biomedical professional collaboration, advances both novelty and societal impact beyond existing generic monitoring systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a cohesive, multi-component monitoring pipeline for foundation models in clinical decision support systems that integrates concept activation vectors (CAVs), behavioral clustering, and counterfactual explanation techniques within a unified framework:\n\n1. **Concept Activation Profiling:** Extract domain-relevant clinical concepts (e.g., symptoms, lab tests, diagnoses) by mapping model internal activations to these concepts using clinically curated CAVs derived from biomedical ontologies.\n\n2. **Baseline Behavioral Clustering:** Construct clusters of normal model behavior in concept activation space on historical clinical datasets, capturing typical decision patterns.\n\n3. **Real-Time Shift Detection:** Continuously monitor incoming clinical inputs by calculating statistical distances (e.g., cosine and Mahalanobis metrics) between current concept activations and baseline clusters. Detection thresholds based on dynamically learned confidence intervals flag potential emergent behavioral shifts.\n\n4. **Triggering Interpretable Diagnostics:** Upon detecting anomalies, generate targeted counterfactual explanations by minimally perturbing inputs to highlight which clinical concepts caused the divergence, explicitly connecting model changes to understandable medical features.\n\n5. **Human-Centric Alerting & Audit Trails:** Present explanations and shift alerts via clinician-friendly dashboards with visualizations contextualized for biomedical decision-making, integrating feedback loops from mental health and biomedical professionals.\n\n6. **Regulatory Compliance Support:** Log all detected shifts, explanatory diagnostics, and clinician actions to build comprehensive audit trails enabling transparency and traceability.\n\nThis modular approach supports replication and parameter tuning while enabling end-to-end linkage from explainability to actionable monitoring in deployment. A detailed algorithmic workflow diagram and pseudocode will accompany implementation for reproducibility.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate and preprocess diverse clinical datasets (e.g., electronic health records, diagnostic images) to annotate domain-specific clinical concepts.\n2) Implement and validate CAV extraction modules aligned to biomedical ontologies.\n3) Train foundation models (e.g., transformer-based architectures) on clinical prediction tasks (diagnosis, treatment recommendations).\n4) Establish baseline behavioral clusters from normal prediction episodes.\n5) Simulate emergent behavioral shifts through domain-relevant distributional changes and synthetic adversarial perturbations to clinical inputs.\n6) Deploy the integrated monitoring framework to detect and explain these shifts in controlled clinical simulation environments.\n7) Conduct human-in-the-loop user studies with biomedical practitioners and mental health professionals to evaluate explanation quality, trust calibration, and clinical decision impact.\n8) Assess system performance via quantitative metrics including detection accuracy, false positive/negative rates, explanation fidelity, clinician trust scores, and compliance audit completeness.\n9) Iterate design based on user feedback to refine alerting mechanisms and visual explanations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: A foundation model supporting mental health diagnosis begins overemphasizing certain symptom clusters due to a shift in patient demographics. The monitoring framework detects deviation in concept activation patterns related to psychiatric symptoms, triggers counterfactual explanations highlighting these symptom activations, and alerts clinicians with actionable insights to recalibrate the model.\n\nExample 2: In an oncology treatment recommendation system, emergent bias arises favoring certain demographic subgroups. Real-time monitoring identifies anomalous concept activations connected to socio-demographic clinical factors, generating interpretable diagnostics that facilitate understanding of disparity origins and guide corrective interventions.\n\nExample 3: During deployment in a remote health application, unexpected adversarial noise corrupts input vitals data, shifting model behavior. The system flags the anomaly, explains the key input perturbations contributing to prediction drift, and supports audit logs for regulatory review.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If concept activation vectors (CAVs) lack sufficient fidelity for clinical concepts, we will integrate alternative model-agnostic methods such as SHAP or LIME with custom clinical feature mappings. To address latency introduced by explainability computations in resource-constrained deployments, we will develop lightweight approximation models and event-driven alerting that selectively invoke diagnostics only upon suspect shifts, balancing responsiveness and computational efficiency. Additionally, if clinician feedback reveals insufficient interpretability, we will incorporate iterative co-design sessions to tailor explanation generation and visualization methods toward better clinical utility."

Specifically, the mechanism by which shifts in concept activations translate into actionable, interpretable diagnostics is not fully detailed. Clarify the workflow, the criteria for anomaly detection, and how counterfactual explanations are generated and linked in real-time to behavioral clusters.

These domains are particularly sensitive to trustworthy AI and emergent behavior risks. For example, adapting the system to monitor foundation models used for diagnostic predictions or personalized treatment recommendations could significantly expand societal impact and auditability. Additionally, incorporating human factors from mental health professionals or biomedical practitioners in the human studies phase would enrich evaluation and foster multidisciplinary collaboration. This cross-domain application could position the work distinctively while deepening the evaluation of trust and interpretability under high-stakes conditions, moving beyond narrow news classification and generic simulated scenarios. Hence, extend plans and examples to include biomedical or health informatics settings as a concrete path to broaden impact and novelty."
