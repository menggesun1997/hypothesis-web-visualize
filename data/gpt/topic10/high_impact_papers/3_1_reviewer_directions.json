    "title": "Cognitive Trust-Enhanced Resource-Aware Robotic Language Interfaces",
    "Problem_Statement": "Robotic systems leveraging large language models (LLMs) typically overlook human cognitive trust factors in their interface design, limiting user trust and adoption despite advances in AI robustness and resource efficiency.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap in integrating human-robot interaction enriched by user trust and cognitive modeling with practical robotics and booming AI. It builds upon Innovation Opportunity 2 to fuse AI model robustness and user-centric design for improved interpretability and trust.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design and construct a human-robot interaction framework embedding cognitive trust models into resource-aware LLM-powered interfaces. The architecture includes an adaptive trust feedback loop that modulates LLM interaction verbosity, confidence indication, and explanation generation based on inferred user cognitive state from multimodal signals (e.g., gaze tracking, physiological data). The system also employs model distillation to maintain resource efficiency while providing real-time trust-enhanced responses during HRI tasks.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop cognitive trust estimation model using multimodal datasets of user-robot interactions. 2) Integrate trust model with an LLM-based dialogue system controlling a robot simulator. 3) Implement resource-aware model compression techniques for real-time operation. 4) Conduct user studies comparing baseline LLM interfaces and trust-enhanced versions on task efficiency, user trust scores, and cognitive load metrics. 5) Evaluate model robustness under different environmental conditions and user profiles.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User commands robot to fetch an object but hesitates, showing signs of mistrust. Expected output: Robotâ€™s interface adapts to provide more detailed explanations and confidence levels, reassuring user and completing task with increased trust and reduced user hesitation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time cognitive state inference is noisy, fallback to simpler heuristic-based trust signals like interaction history. If model compression harms response quality, explore lightweight prompt tuning or retrieval-augmented LLMs. User studies will help iterate interface adaptations."
