    "title": "Federated Learning Enhanced with Cybersecurity-Aware Bias Auditing",
    "Problem_Statement": "Federated learning systems for NLP struggle to conduct thorough bias audits due to distributed data, raising ethical risks undetected.",
    "Motivation": "Leverages the AI and cyber-physical systems bridge to design an integrated federated learning system with embedded cybersecurity features that facilitate transparent, privacy-preserving bias evaluation and mitigation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a federated learning framework with secure audit layers enabling model behavior logging and bias metric computations without compromising data privacy. Use cryptographic techniques to enable auditing by third-party ethical reviewers and automatic bias-triggered model adaptations across federated nodes.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Simulate federated environments with bias-controlled datasets; 2) Implement secure audit logging and bias metric computation modules; 3) Train federated LLMs with audit mechanisms; 4) Evaluate bias detection accuracy, privacy preservation, and ethical compliance; 5) Perform robustness tests against adversarial manipulation attempts.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Federated training across hospitals with demographic biases. Output: Secure bias audit reveals underrepresentation effects, triggering model rebalancing protocols.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If audit overhead is high, employ sampling-based audit procedures or decentralized bias estimations with approximate guarantees."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks detailed explanation of how cryptographic techniques will be integrated to enable third-party bias auditing without compromising privacy. Clarify the specific cryptographic protocols or primitives intended (e.g., secure multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption) and how bias-triggered model adaptations will be coordinated securely across federated nodes. Enhancing clarity here will significantly strengthen the soundness and reproducibility of the approach, ensuring reviewers and practitioners can fully assess the feasibility and security claims, especially given the complex interplay between bias auditing and privacy preservation in federated settings. Consider formalizing threat models and privacy guarantees as well to bolster the methodological rigor consistent with the cybersecurity-aware claim in the title and motivation section."

Specify which bias metrics will be computed (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds) and how privacy will be quantified (e.g., differential privacy parameters or cryptographic leakage bounds). Additionally, clarify the experimental setup for the adversarial scenariosâ€”what types of attacks will be simulated and by which adversarial models. Without these details, the feasibility and scientific soundness of the experiments are unclear, potentially limiting the assessment of the method's real-world applicability and its ethical compliance claims. Enhance this section with quantitative targets and detailed protocols for reproducibility."
