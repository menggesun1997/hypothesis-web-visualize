    "title": "Dynamic Ontology Adaptation for Biomedical NLP via Translation Empirical Feedback",
    "Problem_Statement": "Static biomedical ontologies inadequately capture evolving semantic nuances introduced by translation and interpreting practice, limiting LLM adaptability for clinical language variability.",
    "Motivation": "Combines empirical ties of translation studies with ontology matching dynamics to enable continuous, feedback-driven ontology adaptation supporting emergent biomedical expressions and better semantic normalization.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement a closed-loop system where LLMs generate translation-inspired semantic variations, which inform ontology updates through empirical feedback mechanisms derived from translation corpora and human-in-the-loop validations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect up-to-date biomedical translation corpora. 2. Extract semantic variation patterns via LLM analysis. 3. Propose ontology modifications reflecting these variations. 4. Validate updates with domain experts and evaluate on biomedical NLP tasks. 5. Metrics: ontology coverage, semantic normalization accuracy, downstream task improvements.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: New colloquial biomedical terms arising in patient translations. Expected Output: Ontology evolves to include term variants that improve clinical entity recognition.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If the feedback loop is unstable, incorporate confidence thresholds for ontology edits and fallback to batch offline curation."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that translation and interpreting practice introduce significant semantic nuances not captured by static biomedical ontologies is plausible but should be supported by preliminary empirical evidence or citations. Without establishing the magnitude and nature of these translation-induced semantic shifts, the foundational premise of the approach risks being speculative. I recommend strengthening the Problem Statement by referencing studies quantifying semantic drift or variability in translated biomedical texts, and clarifying how these gaps impede current LLM adaptability in clinical NLP tasks specifically. This will better justify the need for dynamic ontology adaptation driven by translation empirical feedback, enhancing soundness and motivation clarity, making the problem targeted and compelling for the NLP and biomedical community alike.  \n\nAdditionally, clarify how translation-inspired semantic variations can systematically and reliably inform ontology updates rather than introducing noise, addressing potential confounds in linguistic variability versus conceptual shifts within biomedical domains. This will increase trust in the proposed closed-loop mechanism's foundational assumptions and downstream applicability."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the proposal's focus on ontology adaptation informed by translation feedback loops, I suggest leveraging and integrating recent advances in pre-trained language models (e.g., domain-adapted biomedical LLMs) and their capabilities for contextual semantic embeddings to automate and refine semantic variation extraction.\n\nIn particular, consider incorporating techniques from information extraction and functional genomics to enhance semantic normalization and entity recognition. For instance, coupling dynamic ontology updates with Integrated Network and Dynamical Reasoning Assembler (INDRA) frameworks may provide richer, cross-modal evidence to validate ontology changes and ensure biological plausibility.\n\nBy explicitly connecting the proposed system with state-of-the-art EHR-based NLP tasks and leveraging contextual embeddings from pre-trained models, the project can distinctly elevate its impact and novelty beyond existing ontology matching or translation studies, positioning it at the intersection of biomedical NLP, translation empiricism, and systems biology-informed reasoning. This cross-disciplinary integration can unlock valuable real-world clinical utility and improve robustness for downstream applications."
