    "Problem_Statement": "Current human-robot systems poorly integrate psychological theory and moral agency for adaptive, affect-aware interaction, limiting their use in hypothesis testing with real human contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Fulfills the external gap of weak interdisciplinary integration between psychological domains and practical robotics (Opportunity 2), aiming to embody AI agents capable of ethically governed, affect-sensitive communication to transform psychological experiments.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an embodied social robot interface powered by a hybrid LLM-multimodal affect recognition system, integrating moral agency guidelines. The robot adapts dialogue in real-time based on user emotional cues, ethical constraints, and parameterized psychological hypotheses, enabling dynamic, human-in-the-loop testing environments.",

Measure engagement, experimental hypothesis refinement speed, and ethical compliance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Participant expresses frustration during a cognitive task. Output: Robot detects affect, switches to empathetic dialogue and modifies task difficulty to ethically respect participant state while maintaining hypothesis testing integrity.",

        "title": "Advancing Affect-Aware Social Robots with AGI-Driven Moral Reasoning and Multi-Sensor Fusion for Interactive Psychological Hypothesis Exploration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing human-robot interactive systems insufficiently integrate real-time multimodal affective understanding, dynamic moral agency reasoning, and psychological hypothesis testing within naturalistic social contexts. This gap limits their effectiveness and adaptability in both controlled and real-world experimental environments.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the NOV-COMPETITIVE status of prior affect-aware robot systems, this project aims to pioneer a highly integrated interdisciplinary framework combining artificial general intelligence (AGI)-level moral reasoning, advanced multi-sensor fusion, and human-AI interaction paradigms. By advancing beyond prior isolated affect recognition or ethical constraint embeddings, this approach promises enriched naturalistic social robot interactions that adaptively test and refine psychological hypotheses, thereby broadening scientific impact and real-world applicability.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid architecture fusing deep multi-sensor affect recognition—including facial expressions, speech prosody, body posture, physiological signals (e.g., heart rate variability), and environmental context data—using state-of-the-art sensor fusion methods to achieve real-time robust affect inference. An AGI-inspired moral reasoning module continuously evaluates ethical compliance dynamically, leveraging iterative symbolic and neural reasoning to align robot behaviors with evolving moral and psychological experimental constraints. The embodied social robot is empowered by advanced natural language processing augmented with dynamic psychological hypothesis generation and refinement abilities, engaging users in deeply personalized, context-aware dialogues. The system supports fluid switching between real-time adaptive interactions and fallback modes that preserve ethical constraints when sensor reliability degrades. This integration elevates novelty by embedding multi-disciplinary AI advances into a cohesive framework for interactive psychological experimentation in both lab and naturalistic settings.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop multi-sensor data acquisition modules capturing facial, vocal, postural, physiological (e.g., ECG, GSR), and environmental cues; validate sensor synchronization and data fusion techniques to ensure real-time, low-latency, robust affect inference with target metrics (e.g., >85% accuracy, <200ms latency).\n2. Implement and benchmark the AGI-inspired moral reasoning engine, defining quantitative ethical compliance metrics (e.g., % adherence to scripted ethical constraints, conflict resolution scores) through simulated scenarios.\n3. Integrate a dynamic natural language understanding and generation system capable of generating and adapting psychological hypotheses; evaluate on metrics including dialogue coherence, user engagement (using validated scales), and hypothesis refinement speed.\n4. Conduct iterative human-subject experiments in controlled labs with diverse participants, systematically measuring affect recognition accuracy, moral reasoning effectiveness, engagement levels, and ethical compliance. Use privacy-preserving protocols for physiological and behavioral data collection.\n5. Perform comparative studies assessing fallback interaction modes versus full adaptive modes to quantify trade-offs in user engagement, ethical safety, and hypothesis testing integrity.\n6. Transition from simulation-based VR prototype tests to physical robot deployment following clearly defined criteria: sensor fidelity benchmarks, user embodiment feedback, and controlled scenario reproducibility.\n7. Explore real-world pilot deployments in semi-structured social contexts, measuring generalization and robustness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example: A participant exhibits increasing physiological arousal and frustration detected from elevated heart rate and stressed vocal tone during a cognitive task. The robot dynamically integrates multi-sensor cues to confirm elevated stress, invokes AGI moral reasoning to evaluate risk thresholds, then initiates an empathetic dialogue adjusting task difficulty while transparently communicating experimental rationale. Ethical metrics confirm no breach of participant autonomy or distress thresholds; user engagement scores reflect positive experience, and data collected inform refinement of psychological hypotheses. In fallback scenarios with transient physiological sensor loss, the system shifts gracefully to predefined ethical dialogue protocols, maintaining participant safety and experiment validity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Upon degraded multimodal sensor fidelity or uncertain affect inference, the interaction system automatically transitions to rigorously validated ethical dialogue trees ensuring conservative interaction bounded by moral constraints. The experimental protocol explicitly measures the impact of this fallback on user engagement and hypothesis testing capability, informing adaptive balancing strategies. Additionally, comprehensive VR simulations incorporating sensor noise models precede physical deployments, with explicit, quantitative criteria guiding progression (e.g., affect recognition accuracy thresholds, user experience rating stability). This staged approach mitigates risks related to sensor variability, user heterogeneity, and privacy concerns, ensuring robust, reproducible experimental outcomes."

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan lacks clarity on critical implementation details such as how multimodal affect inputs will be synchronized and processed reliably in real-time. Additionally, the plan does not specify metrics or validation criteria for assessing moral agency integration and ethical compliance, which are central to the proposed method. Without these specifics, the feasibility of deploying the prototype in controlled psychological experiments remains uncertain. A more detailed experimental protocol including quantitative benchmarks for affect recognition accuracy, ethical decision-making evaluation, and user engagement metrics is needed to establish practical feasibility and reproducibility of results in real human-robot interaction contexts with psychological hypothesis testing goals. Consider also potential challenges in user variability and privacy implications in affect sensing and moral reasoning modules to strengthen feasibility assessment and study design robustness from the outset.\n\nFurthermore, the fallback plan to restrict interactions to ethical dialogue trees in case of noisy affect detection is useful but could compromise the dynamic adaptive capability claimed as the core strength of the system, so plans to measure and mitigate this trade-off should be included in the experimental setup. Simulated VR tests are a good preliminary step but need clear criteria for transitioning from simulation to physical robot deployment, acknowledging differences in user embodiment and sensor fidelity limitations that could affect outcomes and generalizability."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment classifying this work as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the existing strong interlinks among core components, the project would benefit from deeper integration with broader AI research paradigms. Specifically, leveraging advances in artificial general intelligence (AGI) or more advanced human-AI interaction models could extend both novelty and impact. For example, incorporating state-of-the-art AI capabilities for dynamic reasoning about moral agency and adaptive psychological hypothesis generation could differentiate the work.\n\nMoreover, explicitly connecting the system to multi-sensor fusion strategies beyond affect recognition, by integrating physiological signals or contextual environmental data, would enhance robustness and the robot’s social and ethical interaction quality. Aligning the approach with emerging trends in human-artificial agent interactions and natural language processing to support complex, personalized dialogues could broaden application scope beyond controlled lab experiments into real-world, diverse social settings. Embedding these globally linked concepts into the methodology and experiments would upgrade the project from a competitive combination to a pioneering interdisciplinary framework with greater generality and influence."
