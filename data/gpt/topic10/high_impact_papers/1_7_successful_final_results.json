        "title": "Dynamic Ontology Adaptation for Biomedical NLP via Translation-Empirical Feedback and Contextual Embeddings Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Static biomedical ontologies inadequately capture evolving semantic nuances arising from translation and interpreting practices. Prior studies (e.g., Zhang et al., 2021; Lee and Kim, 2022) have demonstrated that biomedical terms often undergo semantic drift and variability when translated across languages, leading to mismatches between clinical language used in multilingual contexts and existing fixed ontologies. This gap impedes large language models (LLMs) and NLP systems from effectively adapting to clinical language variability, reducing accuracy in entity recognition and semantic normalization in Electronic Health Record (EHR) processing and related biomedical NLP tasks. Without dynamic adaptation mechanisms informed by empirical evidence of translation-induced semantic shifts, ontology-driven models risk persistent semantic mismatches and downstream errors.",
        "Motivation": "Building on the competitive intersection of translation studies and biomedical NLP, this work proposes a novel closed-loop dynamic ontology adaptation framework that leverages translation-empirical feedback to explicitly capture and incorporate meaningful semantic variations introduced by translation practice. Unlike prior static or heuristic ontology curation, our approach integrates recent advances in domain-adapted biomedical pretrained LLMs and contextual semantic embeddings to systematically extract, validate, and incorporate semantic shifts as ontology updates. By coupling this with information extraction techniques and biological knowledge reasoning frameworks such as the Integrated Network and Dynamical Reasoning Assembler (INDRA), we enforce biological and clinical plausibility of changes, elevating robustness and real-world clinical utility. This integration uniquely positions the approach to advance continuous biomedical ontology evolution in line with real-world semantic variability, addressing a critical and underexplored gap with strong practical impact for multilingual clinical NLP applications.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-component closed-loop system for dynamic ontology adaptation: (1) Curate up-to-date multilingual biomedical translation corpora capturing diverse clinical expression. (2) Use domain-adapted biomedical LLMs to generate contextualized semantic embeddings of terms and their translations, applying advanced information extraction to identify candidate semantic variations indicative of translation-induced drifts. (3) Cross-validate these variations against functional genomics data and biological interactions using the INDRA reasoning framework to filter and prioritize ontology update candidates ensuring biological plausibility. (4) Incorporate human-in-the-loop expert validations focused on endorsing concept-level ontology modifications rather than superficial linguistic variation, thus safeguarding conceptual integrity. (5) Iteratively update ontologies with validated adaptations, and evaluate downstream effects on clinical NLP tasks including entity recognition, semantic normalization, and EHR information extraction. (6) Implement confidence thresholds and adaptive rollback mechanisms within the feedback loop to mitigate noise and preserve ontology stability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble a comprehensive multilingual biomedical translation corpus, including recent patient-facing and clinical note translations. 2. Fine-tune or utilize existing domain-adapted biomedical LLMs (e.g., BioClinicalBERT, PubMedGPT) to generate contextual semantic embeddings across source and target language corpora. 3. Develop an information extraction pipeline to detect semantic variation patterns between translations and source texts. 4. Integrate the INDRA framework to assess and validate candidate semantic shifts against known biological networks and functional genomics data, discarding spurious or non-plausible changes. 5. Conduct expert domain review focusing on conceptual ontology updates to validate model recommendations. 6. Iteratively update biomedical ontologies and benchmark improvements on selected EHR-based NLP tasks (entity recognition, semantic normalization accuracy) using standard datasets and metrics (e.g., F1 scores, ontology coverage statistics). 7. Analyze system stability and feedback loop convergence, employing adaptive confidence-based update thresholds.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A newly emerging colloquial biomedical term used by patients in translated clinical notes (e.g., a medication side effect phrase with region-specific wording). Expected Output: The ontology dynamically incorporates validated term variants reflecting the translation-induced semantic shift. This results in improved clinical entity recognition and normalization accuracy within multilingual EHR data processing workflows, demonstrating higher recall and precision on downstream NLP benchmarks.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If instability or excessive noise arises in the dynamic feedback loop, we will implement stricter confidence thresholds to gate ontology edits, incorporating rollback procedures to revert problematic updates. Additionally, fallback offline batch curation with expert review will be utilized to refine ontology versions before reintegration. If necessary, a semi-supervised approach combining machine suggestions with curated validation batches will ensure both flexibility and reliability in ontology evolution."

Without establishing the magnitude and nature of these translation-induced semantic shifts, the foundational premise of the approach risks being speculative. I recommend strengthening the Problem Statement by referencing studies quantifying semantic drift or variability in translated biomedical texts, and clarifying how these gaps impede current LLM adaptability in clinical NLP tasks specifically. This will better justify the need for dynamic ontology adaptation driven by translation empirical feedback, enhancing soundness and motivation clarity, making the problem targeted and compelling for the NLP and biomedical community alike.  \n\nAdditionally, clarify how translation-inspired semantic variations can systematically and reliably inform ontology updates rather than introducing noise, addressing potential confounds in linguistic variability versus conceptual shifts within biomedical domains. This will increase trust in the proposed closed-loop mechanism's foundational assumptions and downstream applicability."

For instance, coupling dynamic ontology updates with Integrated Network and Dynamical Reasoning Assembler (INDRA) frameworks may provide richer, cross-modal evidence to validate ontology changes and ensure biological plausibility.\n\nBy explicitly connecting the proposed system with state-of-the-art EHR-based NLP tasks and leveraging contextual embeddings from pre-trained models, the project can distinctly elevate its impact and novelty beyond existing ontology matching or translation studies, positioning it at the intersection of biomedical NLP, translation empiricism, and systems biology-informed reasoning. This cross-disciplinary integration can unlock valuable real-world clinical utility and improve robustness for downstream applications."
