    "title": "Affect-Aware Social Robot Using LLMs for Interactive Psychological Hypothesis Testing",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current human-robot systems poorly integrate psychological theory and moral agency for adaptive, affect-aware interaction, limiting their use in hypothesis testing with real human contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Fulfills the external gap of weak interdisciplinary integration between psychological domains and practical robotics (Opportunity 2), aiming to embody AI agents capable of ethically governed, affect-sensitive communication to transform psychological experiments.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an embodied social robot interface powered by a hybrid LLM-multimodal affect recognition system, integrating moral agency guidelines. The robot adapts dialogue in real-time based on user emotional cues, ethical constraints, and parameterized psychological hypotheses, enabling dynamic, human-in-the-loop testing environments.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop affect recognition modules for voice, facial, and posture inputs. 2. Train LLMs conditioned on moral agency constraints and psychological experimental scripts. 3. Deploy robot prototypes in controlled labs simulating psychological experiments. 4. Measure engagement, experimental hypothesis refinement speed, and ethical compliance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Participant expresses frustration during a cognitive task. Output: Robot detects affect, switches to empathetic dialogue and modifies task difficulty to ethically respect participant state while maintaining hypothesis testing integrity.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If affect detection is noisy, constrain robot interaction to predefined ethical dialogue trees. Alternatively, simulate human-robot interactions in VR before physical deployment to enhance robustness."

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan lacks clarity on critical implementation details such as how multimodal affect inputs will be synchronized and processed reliably in real-time. Additionally, the plan does not specify metrics or validation criteria for assessing moral agency integration and ethical compliance, which are central to the proposed method. Without these specifics, the feasibility of deploying the prototype in controlled psychological experiments remains uncertain. A more detailed experimental protocol including quantitative benchmarks for affect recognition accuracy, ethical decision-making evaluation, and user engagement metrics is needed to establish practical feasibility and reproducibility of results in real human-robot interaction contexts with psychological hypothesis testing goals. Consider also potential challenges in user variability and privacy implications in affect sensing and moral reasoning modules to strengthen feasibility assessment and study design robustness from the outset.\n\nFurthermore, the fallback plan to restrict interactions to ethical dialogue trees in case of noisy affect detection is useful but could compromise the dynamic adaptive capability claimed as the core strength of the system, so plans to measure and mitigate this trade-off should be included in the experimental setup. Simulated VR tests are a good preliminary step but need clear criteria for transitioning from simulation to physical robot deployment, acknowledging differences in user embodiment and sensor fidelity limitations that could affect outcomes and generalizability."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment classifying this work as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the existing strong interlinks among core components, the project would benefit from deeper integration with broader AI research paradigms. Specifically, leveraging advances in artificial general intelligence (AGI) or more advanced human-AI interaction models could extend both novelty and impact. For example, incorporating state-of-the-art AI capabilities for dynamic reasoning about moral agency and adaptive psychological hypothesis generation could differentiate the work.\n\nMoreover, explicitly connecting the system to multi-sensor fusion strategies beyond affect recognition, by integrating physiological signals or contextual environmental data, would enhance robustness and the robotâ€™s social and ethical interaction quality. Aligning the approach with emerging trends in human-artificial agent interactions and natural language processing to support complex, personalized dialogues could broaden application scope beyond controlled lab experiments into real-world, diverse social settings. Embedding these globally linked concepts into the methodology and experiments would upgrade the project from a competitive combination to a pioneering interdisciplinary framework with greater generality and influence."
