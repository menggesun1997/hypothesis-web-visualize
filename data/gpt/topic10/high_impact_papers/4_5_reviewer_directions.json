    "title": "Bridging Gaze Tracking and LLM Dialogue in Collaborative Social Robotics for Hypothesis Exploration",
    "Problem_Statement": "Limited integration of nonverbal cues like gaze tracking with LLM-based dialogue for enriched human-robot collaboration in psychological research.",
    "Motivation": "Fills external gap between software implementation and practical robotics using human-centered computing advances, enriching interaction fidelity for hypothesis testing (Opportunity 3).",
    "Proposed_Method": "Combine state-of-the-art gaze tracking hardware/software with LLM-driven dialogue in a collaborative robot platform, allowing the robot to interpret gaze patterns as contextual cues adjusting conversational strategies and experimental task presentations dynamically.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop calibration and gaze signal processing pipelines. 2. Train LLM dialogue models conditioned on gaze-derived context embeddings. 3. Deploy in lab tasks requiring mutual attention shifts and reasoning. 4. Evaluate interaction naturalness, hypothesis generation rates, and user satisfaction.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Participant gazes away from robot during question about emotional state. Output: Robot adapts dialogue to re-engage participant or infer discomfort, refining questioning accordingly.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If gaze tracking signal is noisy, utilize alternative physiological signals (e.g., pupil dilation) or default to conversational cues. If LLMs cannot integrate gaze context, apply reinforcement learning for behavior adaptation."

          "feedback_content": "While the idea to integrate gaze tracking signals into LLM-driven dialogue for adaptive robot interactions is promising, the mechanism for how gaze-derived context embeddings will be effectively extracted, represented, and integrated into the LLM's dialogue generation process is not sufficiently detailed. Clarify the technical approach to fuse multimodal inputs (gaze data plus dialogue context), including any model architectures or interfaces bridging perception and language components. This will strengthen the proposalâ€™s soundness and help evaluate the practical innovation behind the combined system design, especially given the competitive research landscape in human-robot multimodal interaction. Consider specifying whether gaze embeddings modify LLM prompt conditioning, attention mechanisms, or act as inputs for behavior policy learning (e.g., reinforcement learning). This detail is needed to validate the core technical novelty and feasibility assumptions embedded in the Proposed_Method section."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a logical progression but lacks concrete details regarding the complexity and controllability of experimental tasks, as well as metrics for evaluation beyond qualitative descriptors. To enhance feasibility and rigor, explicitly define the lab task scenarios and mutual attention shifts expected, the datasets or participant demographics involved, and quantitative measures for interaction naturalness (e.g., engagement time, gaze synchrony), hypothesis generation rates, and user satisfaction (e.g., standardized surveys). Also, discuss potential challenges like gaze tracking noise, real-time system latency, and how fallback mechanisms will be quantitatively evaluated. Without these clarifications, it remains uncertain if the experiments can reliably validate the proposed system within reasonable resource constraints."
