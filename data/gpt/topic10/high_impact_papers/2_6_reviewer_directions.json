    "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Dynamic Explanation Refinement in NLP Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Static explanations generated by XAI tools often fail to meet individual users' evolving ethical concerns or understanding needs.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the fragmentation gap by integrating human feedback loops into explanation generation, inspired by human-robot interaction and collaborative intelligence paradigms from the hidden bridges.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an NLP explanation system that solicits iterative user feedback on explanations, updating explanation style, content, and ethical framing dynamically. Use reinforcement signals to optimize explanation generation models for personalized, ethically aligned transparency.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement baseline explanation generation models; 2) Set up feedback collection interfaces; 3) Integrate reinforcement learning to optimize explanation refinement; 4) Test on diverse user groups with varying preferences; 5) Measure improvements in understanding, trust, and ethical perception; 6) Compare to non-adaptive explanation baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User requests simpler explanations after initial complex summary on language generation output. Output: System provides progressively refined, user-tailored explanations enhancing clarity and ethical insight.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If reinforcement learning convergence is slow, resort to supervised fine-tuning with collected feedback datasets or recommendation-based explanation selection."

          "feedback_content": "While the experiment plan lays out a clear sequence, it lacks detailed considerations on how user feedback will be effectively captured and quantified for reinforcement learning, which is critical given the subjective nature of explanations and ethical perceptions. Clarifying methods for robust feedback aggregation, handling noisy or contradictory inputs, and ensuring stable RL training convergence are essential to demonstrate feasibility. Also, contingency plans beyond supervised fine-tuning, such as hybrid models or user clustering strategies, could strengthen practical viability, as pure RL approaches in user-centric explanation refinement can be notoriously challenging to optimize reliably in limited data regimes. Adding these specifics would greatly enhance confidence in the methodological feasibility and experimental rigor of the study, especially when targeting diverse user groups and ethical framing adaptations within NLP explanation systems. This is crucial before moving forward to implementation and evaluation phases in the experiment plan section. Target: Experiment_Plan."

          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screening novelty rating as NOV-COMPETITIVE, integrating domain-specific application areas from the linked concepts could significantly boost both impact and distinctiveness. For example, applying the human-in-the-loop dynamic explanation refinement approach to 'clinical decision support' or 'intelligent tutoring systems' can contextualize ethical transparency and adaptivity in high-stakes or education-critical NLP settings. This grounding in concrete, impactful domains would demonstrate real-world utility, foster interdisciplinary insights, and help align ethical explanation customization with specific user needs (e.g., patient safety professionals or learners). Concrete integration of these domains in experiments or motivating examples would amplify relevance and strengthen the submission's contribution narrative to the broader community.
