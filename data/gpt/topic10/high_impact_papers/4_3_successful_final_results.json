        "title": "Robust Quality-Improvement-Informed Continuous Fine-Tuning of LLMs for Adaptive Psychological Measurement in Longitudinal Clinical Settings",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current static large language models (LLMs) fall short of effectively adapting to longitudinal psychological datasets characterized by evolving measurement protocols, heterogeneous patient language, and variable, often noisy clinician feedback. These issues risk outdated or inaccurate assessment outputs, hinder reliable longitudinal tracking, and limit practical utility in clinical care. Furthermore, inconsistent clinical feedback and shifting symptom definitions introduce substantial measurement drift and noise that, if unaddressed, can destabilize continuous fine-tuning mechanisms and compromise model reliability over time.",
        "Motivation": "This work addresses the critical gap in leveraging continuous quality improvement (QI) approaches with human-in-the-loop model adaptation to create dynamically updating psychological LLMs that maintain fidelity and robustness amid real-world clinical complexities. Unlike prior efforts that assume stable, high-quality feedback or static measurement frameworks, we propose an innovative system integrating robust feedback noise modeling, adaptive learning rate modulation, and gating-based stability mechanisms guided by comprehensive human feedback quality indices. By building on insights from human-centric AI and user feedback weighting strategies, the approach promises a novel, practically deployable framework for real-time clinical adaptation of mental health NLP models, enhancing longitudinal measurement sensitivity and clinician trust. This redefines the state-of-the-art by explicitly modeling and mitigating the challenges of measurement drift, clinician input variability, and symptom definition changes over time, making the approach uniquely suitable for dynamic psychological care settings.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a robust, multi-component continuous fine-tuning framework for LLMs targeting longitudinal psychological assessment adaptation. Key innovations include: (1) Modeling and quantifying human feedback reliability via inter-rater agreement, clinician expertise level, and temporal consistency, leveraging these as explicit weights in fine-tuning loss functions; (2) Implementing adaptive learning rates modulated by detected measurement drift statistics and feedback noise distributions, guided by continual monitoring of symptom definition shifts; (3) Incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by mixture-of-expert architectures, which dynamically calibrates the extent of fine-tuning updates, preserving model stability and preventing catastrophic forgetting; (4) Integrating multi-source user feedback fusion, combining clinician assessments with patient-reported language evolution and automated health sensing signals where available; (5) Embedding ethical safeguards by anonymizing datasets, timestamping all data and feedback for traceability, and aligning updates with privacy constraints and clinical governance policies; and (6) Utilizing concepts from human-centric AI and user feedback systems to ensure transparency and explainability in model adaptation decisions. This comprehensive pipeline is designed to maintain robustness, interpretability, and continual alignment with evolving clinical measurement frameworks in psychological longitudinal data contexts.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Acquisition: Collaborate with established longitudinal mental health cohorts and clinical partners to obtain datasets containing repeated patient language samples, clinician measurement protocols, and timestamped feedback over at least 6-12 months covering protocol evolutions. Inclusion criteria require documented evolving symptom definitions or measurement updates to validate dynamic adaptation. Privacy and ethical approvals will guide data handling. 2. Baseline Model Definition: Select and establish baseline static LLMs pretrained on clinical or general text corpora, including domain-adapted versions without continuous fine-tuning, specifying their architectures, training data size, and clinical relevance. 3. Feedback Collection Protocol: Systematically collect clinician feedback on model outputs using standardized forms with quality indices such as inter-rater reliability, clinician confidence scores, and consistency checks to quantify feedback noise. Incorporate patient self-reports and, where feasible, non-linguistic health sensing data for multi-source fusion. 4. Robust Fine-Tuning Implementation: Develop and execute iterative fine-tuning cycles incorporating weighted feedback loss functions, adaptive learning rate schedules, and gating mechanisms controlling parameter updates, aligned with measurement drift detection modules. 5. Evaluation Metrics: Assess performance using a battery of metrics including (a) prediction accuracy on symptom severity and classification tasks; (b) model robustness via stability metrics across fine-tuning iterations (e.g., weight divergence, forgetting indices); (c) temporal alignment measuring model output adherence to evolving clinical measurement definitions; (d) clinician satisfaction gauged through surveys; and (e) ethical compliance and privacy evaluations. 6. Analysis and Validation: Conduct ablation studies to evaluate impact of each robustness component, analyze failure modes, and validate fallback mechanisms as integrated baseline components rather than contingencies.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example: Input longitudinal patient language data representing social media posts and clinical interviews collected monthly over 6 months, including evolving symptom colloquialisms and newly defined anxiety criteria. Output: Model updates dynamically weighted by clinician-rated feedback reliability and adapting to novel symptom expressions; subsequent severity scores of anxiety that better reflect clinician judgments and patient-reported outcomes over time, demonstrating improved temporal fidelity and robustness against noisy feedback. Additional cases involve multi-source fusion combining wearable-derived stress indicators and patient mobile app reviews to refine model adaptation in perinatal mental health contexts, illustrating integration of health sensing and app review concepts.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Recognizing the high risk of instability due to feedback noise and measurement drift, fallback mechanisms are embedded as primary robustness modules rather than contingencies: (1) The gating mixture-of-expert layers act as controlled calibration interfaces to absorb abrupt measurement shifts, preventing catastrophic forgetting; (2) Human feedback is systematically weighted by rater agreement and temporal consistency to mitigate influence of unreliable inputs; (3) If fine-tuning induces instability, updates default to lightweight parameter adapters that adjust only final prediction layers while preserving base model embeddings; (4) In cases of insufficient or inconsistent feedback, the model leverages multi-source fusion (e.g., patient self-reports and health sensing data) to supplement clinical inputs; and (5) Continuous monitoring triggers human expert oversight alerts to intervene when model drift exceeds pre-defined thresholds. These integrated mechanisms ensure stable, robust, and ethically responsible adaptation in complex longitudinal clinical scenarios."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that fine-tuning LLMs continuously with quality improvement (QI) cycles will reliably capture evolving psychological measurement protocols needs stronger justification. Psychological assessments often suffer from noisy, subjective, and inconsistent clinical feedback that might destabilize model updates. Clarify how the approach explicitly accounts for or mitigates fundamental challenges like changing symptom definitions, heterogeneous patient language, and variable clinician input reliability to avoid undermining soundness of the adaptation mechanism. This will strengthen confidence in the foundational premise of continuous clinical fine-tuning for psychological longitudinal data adaptation, especially given the fallback plans suggest non-trivial instability risks under the main method assumptions are partially unvalidated yet consistent performance is required in practice. Without this clarity, the problem framing may rest on overly optimistic assumptions about LLM adaptability under realistic clinical data shifts and human feedback noise patterns, limiting the soundness of the core idea's practicality and impact potential at scale and over time. Consider including a dedicated analysis of the types and distributions of expected feedback noise and measurement drift in the problem statement or methodological section to validate these assumptions upfront, or outline specific robustness mechanisms beyond fallback plans tied to gating or calibration layers as primary components rather than contingencies. Given that human feedback quality indices are central yet could be unstable or unreliable themselves, expanding the conceptual coverage of how this data is modeled and weighted systematically within the fine-tuning loop is recommended to improve soundness from the ground up.  \n\nSummary: Provide a more rigorous grounding and explicit mitigation strategies for key assumptions about feedback reliability and measurement stability to enhance soundness of the proposed continuous fine-tuning approach in dynamic psychological measurement contexts.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step-by-Step Experiment Plan outlines key phases but lacks critical practical details compromising feasibility evaluation. For instance, the plan does not specify how longitudinal psychological datasets will be acquired or what inclusion criteria ensure they capture evolving measurement protocols, which is central to validating the idea. Clarify the data provenance, size, diversity, and how clinical feedback will be systematically collected, standardized, and timestamped to enable meaningful QI cycles; these operational details heavily influence feasibility. Additionally, the plan should specify the criteria and methods for defining baseline static LLM models (e.g., model sizes, pretraining corpora, clinical domain adaptation), as these baselines critically contextualize intervention benefits. The evaluation metrics should be expanded beyond prediction accuracy and clinician satisfaction to include metrics that measure model robustness, convergence stability over multiple fine-tuning cycles, and temporal alignment with clinical measurement changes, addressing risks of catastrophic forgetting or overfitting to noisy feedback. Finally, consider potential ethical and privacy constraints around clinical data use, integration of human feedback, and iterative model updates, which may impact feasibility in clinical settings. Explicitly addressing how these will be managed will strengthen the experimental plan's practicality and make it more convincing and actionable for real-world deployment scenarios. \n\nSummary: Augment the experiment plan with detailed data acquisition protocols, feedback collection methodologies, baseline definitions, comprehensive evaluation metrics (including model stability), and ethical/privacy considerations to ensure scientific and operational feasibility of the investigation."
