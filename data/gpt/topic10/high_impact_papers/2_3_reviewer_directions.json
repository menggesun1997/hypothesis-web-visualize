    "title": "Multimodal Explainability Metrics Incorporating Emotional Context",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing XAI evaluation lacks comprehensive metrics incorporating user emotional responses, limiting understanding of explanation effectiveness in ethical contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the research gap in assessment methodologies for explainability by integrating emotion recognition from the hidden bridge between recognition models and adaptive UIs, enabling holistic evaluation beyond technical correctness.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a suite of multimodal explainability metrics combining quantitative measures (e.g., fidelity, consistency) with emotional response indicators (facial expression, physiological signals) captured during explanation delivery. The framework assesses ethical satisfaction and trustworthiness from both technical and affective perspectives.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect explanation sessions with user emotional data; 2) Quantify technical explanation qualities; 3) Analyze correlation between emotion signals and technical metrics; 4) Validate metric predictiveness for user trust and ethical judgment; 5) Benchmark across multiple LLM tasks and explanation methods.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User views explanation for a sentiment classifier's prediction, with captured facial expression indicating confusion. Output: Metric scores highlight low emotional engagement despite high technical fidelity.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If physiological data is unreliable, rely on self-reported emotional surveys or behavioral proxies such as interaction duration or query frequency."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while logically ordered, lacks specific details on how various emotional data modalities (facial expression, physiological signals) will be synchronized, normalized, and integrated with technical metrics. Physiological signal collection and interpretation can be noisy and context-dependent, requiring robust preprocessing and validation pipelines that are not described. In addition, scalability across multiple LLM tasks and explanation methods may introduce heterogeneity that complicates metric standardization. Strengthening the plan by outlining concrete procedures, data preprocessing, multimodal fusion strategies, and pilot evaluation phases will greatly enhance feasibility confidence, especially considering the fallback reliance on self-reports or behavioral proxies which need formal integration into the study design as well. Further, clarify subject recruitment criteria and ethical considerations related to emotion capture to ensure practicality and compliance with standards for human subject research."

          "feedback_content": "To elevate the novelty and impact beyond a competitive baseline, consider integrating state-of-the-art real-time emotion detection techniques such as EEG-based emotion detection or Spiking Neural Networks from the provided global concepts, which could offer more fine-grained and reliable emotional indicators than facial or peripheral physiological signals alone. Additionally, leveraging advanced information fusion techniques, such as bidirectional long short-term memory networks or gated recurrent units, could enable more sophisticated temporal modeling of emotional responses alongside explanation features. This integration would enhance the methodological rigor and potentially yield more robust, generalizable multimodal explainability metrics suitable for clinical decision support tools or affective computing applications, thus broadening impact and aligning with emerging interdisciplinary priorities."
