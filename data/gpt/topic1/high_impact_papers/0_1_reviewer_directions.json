    "title": "eHealth-Informed Cross-Media Communication Effectiveness Metric Suite",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing communication effectiveness metrics inadequately capture quality-of-life impacts and care coordination analogs in complex cross-media studies, leaving outcome measures shallow and non-comparable.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the global gap highlighting underutilization of eHealth intervention evaluation frameworks in communication research, enabling novel, outcome-oriented metrics that bridge healthcare quality assessments with media impact studies.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design and validate a comprehensive metric suite inspired by eHealth care coordination and quality-of-life evaluation paradigms. This suite maps media interaction outcomes to surrogate health and wellbeing proxies, integrating subjective user feedback, engagement analytics, and thematic impact measures, implemented via a modular retrieval-augmented evaluation toolkit.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Extract principles from eHealth evaluation literature on care coordination and QoL metrics. 2) Identify analogous constructs in cross-media communication (e.g., message coherence, behavioral influence). 3) Develop mapping algorithms and software tools. 4) Apply on datasets involving health communication campaigns across multiple media types. 5) Assess correlation with independent behavioral outcome measures and user surveys.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Campaign combining TV ads, Twitter posts, and podcasts promoting mental health awareness. Output: Quantified metrics reflecting coordination effectiveness (message consistency across channels), recipient quality-of-life proxies (self-reported stigma reduction), and behavioral intent changes, demonstrating comprehensive effectiveness.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct mapping to QoL proxies fails, revert to a reduced metric set focusing on validated engagement and sentiment analysis measures. Alternatively, employ qualitative follow-up studies for metric refinement."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that cross-media communication effectiveness can be reliably and validly mapped directly onto surrogate health and quality-of-life proxies is not sufficiently justified. Quality-of-life impacts and care coordination are complex, multifactorial constructs even within eHealth, and their analogs in media studies may not correspond straightforwardly. Clarify and strengthen the theoretical rationale and evidence supporting this assumed mapping to avoid foundational weaknesses in the proposed metric suite's conceptual basis, or risk developing metrics that lack construct validity and interpretability across disciplines. Consider explicating intermediate constructs or mediators linking media exposure to health-related outcomes to solidify your assumption base, possibly via a theoretical framework drawn from health communication and eHealth literatures combined. This is crucial before moving forward with algorithm design and metric validation to ensure soundness of the approach in Proposed_Method and Problem_Statement sections. Target both problem statement and method sections for this revision to ensure conceptual alignment and rigor needed for interdisciplinary translation of metrics from healthcare to media studies contexts.\n\n"

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while logical, lacks detail on the operationalization of key variables and the availability and characteristics of datasets suitable for rigorous validation. In particular, the plan does not specify how independent behavioral outcome measures and user surveys will be selected, measured, or validated alongside the metric outputs. Given the complexity of integrating multi-modal media data, subjective feedback, and health/proxy outcomes, the feasibility hinges on access to comprehensive, high-quality datasets that combine such elements. Clarify dataset criteria, preprocessing methods, and analytic strategies to address potential noise, bias, and confounds inherent in real-world health communication campaigns. Additionally, more detail on the modular retrieval-augmented evaluation toolkit's design and potential software frameworks (e.g., interpretable machine learning, scalable APIs) would aid feasibility assessment. Strengthening this section will help convince reviewers of practical viability and scalability of your validation approach, ensuring replicability and robustness in complex cross-media contexts."
