    "title": "Socio-Technically Integrated Bias Auditing Framework for LLMs in Media Studies",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM bias audits focus narrowly on technical metrics without integrating rich social science evaluation methodologies, leading to incomplete assessments of societal impact.",
    "Motivation": "Bridges gaps between communication ethnography, media studies, and technical AI fairness methods by developing a joint evaluation framework that combines sociocultural qualitative methods with quantitative AI bias audits, providing fuller insight into LLM fairness and ethical implications.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid audit framework including computational fairness metrics, ethnographic coding schemas, sentiment and discourse analysis tools, and participatory evaluation sessions with affected communities. This system incorporates communication research techniques to contextualize quantitative bias findings, yielding nuanced bias impact profiles per domain and population.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select communication datasets and LLMs deployed in media-related contexts.\n2) Apply automated quantitative bias metrics.\n3) Perform ethnographic content analysis on generated outputs.\n4) Conduct participatory workshops collecting stakeholder feedback.\n5) Correlate findings to refine fairness auditing tools and model training adjustments.\n6) Iterate audit-feedback loop to improve overall fairness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An LLM-generated news summary on race relations.\nExpected Output: Audit results detail not only algorithmic bias scores but ethnographic assessment of narrative framing and community perceptions, enabling richer fairness insights.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If human-in-the-loop evaluations are expensive or slow, develop proxy metrics validated against ethnographic insights to automate parts of the framework."
