    "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Synergistic Framework Fusing Expert Editors, Mixed Methods, and Recommender Systems for LLM Prompt Engineering",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of interdisciplinary integration between expert-curated content, mixed methods, and adaptive recommender systems limits prompt engineering's ability to handle knowledge quality, relevance, and dynamic context adaptation cohesively.",
    "Motivation": "Directly exploits the hidden bridges among 'expert editors', 'mixed methods research', and 'recommender systems' to pioneer a novel synergy that addresses both internal fragmentation and external missed connections leading to coherent high-quality prompt personalization.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a layered architecture where expert editorial curation forms a validated knowledge base; mixed methods ensure rigorous data collection and validation cycles; recommender systems personalize knowledge retrieval based on user context and interaction history. The framework uses ontological mappings to harmonize knowledge representation, enabling adaptive prompt generation responsive to evolving user needs and data complexities.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multi-domain expert-curated knowledge datasets.\n2) Implement a mixed methods workflow for continuous validation.\n3) Develop a contextual recommender engine linked to user interaction patterns.\n4) Integrate components into a unified prompt generation system.\n5) Evaluate on diverse few-shot learning benchmarks incorporating personalization and knowledge fidelity.\nMetrics: relevance, user adaptability, task success, knowledge consistency.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User with previous queries on medical diagnosis receives dynamically personalized, expert-validated prompt suggestions enhancing accuracy.\nExpected Output: Improved recommendation relevance and task performance reflecting integrated multi-disciplinary insights.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If system complexity impairs performance, modularize components for independent optimization and asynchronous integration with fallback to static expert-curated prompts."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposal outlines a layered architecture combining expert curation, mixed methods, and recommender systems, the description lacks specificity on how these components dynamically interact in real-time prompt engineering workflows. Clarify the mechanisms and protocols enabling harmonization via ontological mappings, data flow between modules, and feedback loops ensuring adaptive prompt generation that meaningfully integrates multi-disciplinary insights rather than mere component juxtaposition. This clarification is critical to assess soundness and potential innovation beyond an aggregation of existing methods, particularly given the competitive novelty landscape in recommender system-enhanced prompt engineering frameworks. Providing a concrete architectural diagram or pseudocode could enhance clarity and soundness assessment here (target section: Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_content": "To elevate novelty and impact beyond the current competitive baseline, consider explicitly integrating concepts from 'mental health prediction' and 'adaptive instructional systems' within your framework. For example, adapt the recommender system to personalize prompts not only on user interaction history but also on inferred mental health states or learning progress in educational settings, thereby creating intelligent decision-making pathways that satisfy domain-specific quality and adaptability criteria. This cross-domain extension using globally linked concepts can uniquely position your framework to tackle high-impact applied challenges in health or educational technology, increasing relevance and broadening appeal to interdisciplinary communities (target section: Problem_Statement)."
