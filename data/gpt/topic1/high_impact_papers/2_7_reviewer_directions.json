    "title": "Dynamic Knowledge Source Integrator for Scalable Multi-Domain LLM Few-Shot Prompting",
    "Problem_Statement": "Challenges exist in scaling prompt adaptivity and knowledge integration across diverse, heterogeneous sources in few-shot learning scenarios within LLMs.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by the internal limitation of scaling adaptivity and integrating multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases, proposes a transformative dynamic integrator to automate and personalize knowledge selection and blending for prompt generation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build an intelligent middleware that catalogs heterogeneous knowledge sources, performs on-the-fly relevance scoring, and merges knowledge fragments using meta-learning strategies. It dynamically selects and integrates knowledge based on task context, user profile, and prompt requirements, enabling scalable multi-domain prompt adaptation. Mixed methods analysis guide relevance models to incorporate human contextual understanding.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Aggregate diverse domain knowledge bases.\n2) Develop meta-learning model for dynamic relevance scoring.\n3) Construct knowledge fusion module.\n4) Integrate with LLM prompting.\n5) Test on multi-domain few-shot tasks with user variability.\nMetrics: scalability, adaptation accuracy, knowledge relevance, task outcome improvements.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt drawing from medical, legal, and technical knowledge for a multi-disciplinary question.\nExpected Output: Coherent answer leveraging dynamically integrated knowledge from all relevant domains.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If automated integration reduces precision, incorporate user-guided integration controls or restrict to prioritized domains per task."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a high-level middleware integrating heterogeneous knowledge sources via dynamic relevance scoring and meta-learning but lacks clarity on key design choices. For example, how knowledge fragments are represented, merged, or disambiguated remains underspecified; the meta-learning approach for relevance scoring and its training signal are not detailed; and how user profile/context is formalized, incorporated, or updated dynamically is unclear. Clarify these mechanisms with architectural sketches or algorithms to strengthen the soundness of the method’s core technical novelty and feasibility assumptions, avoiding it seeming a high-level concept without concrete operationalization or novel technical insight beyond prior meta-learning and knowledge integration frameworks. This clarification is critical given the competitive novelty landscape cited in the assessment, to distinguish the technical contributions clearly and demonstrate the method’s internal coherence and viability at scale and heterogeneity levels targeted in the problem statement and experiments. Target: Proposed_Method section, to enable readers and evaluators to gauge rigor and originality precisely at the core technical level."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is conceptually sound but would benefit from more granular methodological details and risk analysis to validate feasibility. For instance, specify datasets envisaged for \"diverse domain knowledge bases\": are these curated, open, or proprietary, and how heterogeneity is managed practically? The meta-learning relevance model development needs experimental protocol details: model inputs, supervision signals, training/validation regime, and expected computational resources. Similarly, how knowledge fusion will be validated — metrics, ablation studies — must be elaborated. Elaborate benchmarks for “scalability,” “adaptation accuracy,” and “knowledge relevance” with quantitative targets or comparator baselines. Such details will aid in reproducibility, feasibility assessment, and provide a more rigorous experimental roadmap critical for acceptance at premier venues. Target: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan."
