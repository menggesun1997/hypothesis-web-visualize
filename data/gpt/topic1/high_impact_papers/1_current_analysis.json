Through an enormous experimental effort1, 2, 3–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50\\xa0years9. Despite recent progress10, 11, 12, 13–14, existing methods fall far\\xa0short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Networks', 'abstract': 'The scientific study of networks, including computer networks, social networks, and biological networks, has received an enormous amount of interest in the last few years. The rise of the Internet and the wide availability of inexpensive computers have made it possible to gather and analyze network data on a large scale, and the development of a variety of new theoretical tools has allowed us to extract new knowledge from many different kinds of networks. The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and important developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social sciences. This book brings together the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas. Subjects covered include the measurement and structure of networks in many branches of science, methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology, the fundamentals of graph theory, computer algorithms, and spectral methods, mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models, and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': '“So what if ChatGPT wrote it?” Multidisciplinary perspectives on opportunities, challenges and implications of generative conversational AI for research, practice and policy', 'abstract': 'Transformative artificially intelligent tools, such as ChatGPT, designed to generate sophisticated text indistinguishable from that produced by a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'States of Knowledge, The Co-Production of Science and Social Order', 'abstract': 'Notes on contributors Acknowledgements 1.

However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of “unrolling” an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in Signal Processing, we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN into the “Vanilla LSTM” 1 1 The nickname “Vanilla LSTM” symbolizes this model’s flexibility and generality (Greff et\\xa0al., 2015). network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date. The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our new augmented LSTM model in software for experimentation and research will find the insights and derivations in this treatise valuable as well.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI', 'abstract': 'In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'The SAGE Encyclopedia of Qualitative Research Methods', 'abstract': \"Qualitative research is designed to explore the human elements of a given topic, while specific qualitative methods examine how individuals see and experience the world.

As electronic data about individuals becomes increasingly detailed, and as technology enables ever more powerful collection and curation of these data, the need increases for a robust, meaningful, and mathematically rigorous definition of privacy, together with a computationally rich class of algorithms that satisfy this definition. Differential Privacy is such a definition. After motivating and discussing the meaning of differential privacy, the preponderance of this monograph is devoted to fundamental techniques for achieving differential privacy, and application of these techniques in creative combinations, using the query-release problem as an ongoing example. A key point is that, by rethinking the computational goal, one can often obtain far better results than would be achieved by methodically replacing each step of a non-private computation with a differentially private implementation. Despite some astonishingly powerful computational results, there are still fundamental limitations — not just on what can be achieved with differential privacy but on what can be achieved with any method that protects against a complete breakdown in privacy. Virtually all the algorithms discussed herein maintain differential privacy against adversaries of arbitrary computational power. Certain algorithms are computationally intensive, others are efficient. Computational complexity for the adversary and the algorithm are both discussed. We then turn from fundamentals to applications other than queryrelease, discussing differentially private methods for mechanism design and machine learning. The vast majority of the literature on differentially private algorithms considers a single, static, database that is subject to many analyses. Differential privacy in other models, including distributed databases and computations on data streams is discussed. Finally, we note that this work is meant as a thorough introduction to the problems and techniques of differential privacy, but is not intended to be an exhaustive survey — there is by now a vast amount of work in differential privacy, and we can cover only a small portion of it.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Electrodermal Activity', 'abstract': 'Electrodermal Activity, Second Edition Wolfram Boucsein From EEG technology to the polygraph, psychophysiology has become part of mainstream science, encompassing a number of subspecialties.

Increased scholarly interest in EDA has brought with it a wealth of improvements in recording, analyzing, and applying data—and a need to make this knowledge available in a readable, practice-oriented format. The Second Edition of Electrodermal Activity brings together research from biology, psychology, and physics for a comprehensive understanding of the subject and its potential across mental health and medical disciplines. As in the original volume, the reader is given a thorough grounding in electrodermal phenomena: the anatomy and physiology of the electrodermal system, the biophysics of measurement, and the history of the field. From there, the book incorporates two decades’ worth of new knowledge, not just on innovative measurement and analytic techniques but also in the area of applications, with new or completely rewritten chapters on the use of EDA in: Decision-making. Human-computer interaction. Neurological diseases and brain lesions. Anxiety, depression, psychopathy, and schizophrenia. Detection of deception. Biofeedback, product evaluation, and more.

Attempts to assess the clinical knowledge of models typically rely on automated evaluations based on limited benchmarks. Here, to address these limitations, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing medical question answering datasets spanning professional medicine, research and consumer queries and\\xa0a new dataset of medical questions searched online, HealthSearchQA. We propose a human evaluation framework for model answers along multiple axes including factuality, comprehension,\\xa0reasoning, possible harm and bias. In addition, we evaluate Pathways Language Model1 (PaLM,\\xa0a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM2 on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA3, MedMCQA4, PubMedQA5 and Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) clinical topics6), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA\\xa0(US Medical Licensing Exam-style questions), surpassing the prior state of the art by more than 17%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps. To resolve this, we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, knowledge recall and reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal limitations of today’s models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLMs for clinical applications.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "current_research_landscape": "The core focus of this research cluster revolves around highly accurate protein structure prediction, highlighted through central concepts such as 'protein structure prediction,' 'accurate protein structure prediction,' and benchmarking efforts like the 'Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction'. This theme is complemented by a significant focus on network data analysis and mathematical modeling of networks, underscoring the importance of leveraging complex relational data for knowledge extraction. Foundational works like AlphaFold demonstrate the promise of deep learning and biologically informed neural network architectures in breaking longstanding barriers in structural bioinformatics. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) such as PaLM and its fine-tuned variants exhibit substantial advances in encoding clinical knowledge, particularly through instruction prompt tuning, aligning closely with domain-specific expertise tasks. Methodologically, this landscape integrates deep learning architectures (e.g., LSTM derivatives, graph neural networks implicit in network studies), knowledge embedding, and domain adaptation strategies linked to explainable AI concepts and rigorous evaluation frameworks. The thematic islands confirm two primary paradigms: one focusing on biochemical and structural biology applications, and another emphasizing network science and knowledge extraction from complex datasets. Bridge nodes like 'network data' connect these realms, illustrating interdisciplinary linkages between biological structures and network modeling.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps largely center on limitations in model interpretability, domain adaptation efficacy, and comprehensive evaluation of clinical and biological knowledge integration. Despite advances in AlphaFold and LLMs for clinical knowledge, human evaluator analyses reveal shortcomings in reasoning, factuality, and domain-specific comprehension. The bridge concept 'network data' highlights potential underexploited intersections between diverse data modalities, yet existing studies do not fully leverage multi-relational or graph-based embeddings in fine-tuning LLMs for specialized domains. Moreover, conventional benchmarks lack robustness in capturing the full scope of domain-specific expertise acquisition and safety considerations outlined in explainable and responsible AI work. External gaps emerge from the GPS analysis revealing a hidden bridge between 'protein structure prediction' and 'network data' through concepts like protein-protein interaction networks, graph neural networks, and protein function prediction. Current research underutilizes such structural network embeddings within large language models to embed biological relational knowledge systematically, which could enhance domain-specific reasoning and accuracy. This multidimensional integration across bioinformatics and network science paradigms presents an overlooked frontier that could substantially improve fine-tuning strategies for LLMs aimed at scientific and clinical expertise.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate graph neural network-based protein interaction embeddings (from the hidden bridge) with LLM fine-tuning methods (thematic island: protein structure prediction) to enhance domain-specific factual recall and reasoning, addressing limitations in accuracy and understanding stated in the clinical LLM evaluation papers. This fusion would leverage relational biological knowledge for better context-aware predictions.\n\nOpportunity 2: Develop multi-modal hybrid models combining network data analytical frameworks (bridge node) with instruction prompt tuning strategies (from LLM clinical knowledge papers) to create interpretable, explainable fine-tuning pipelines for domain expertise, directly confronting explainability and trust issues raised by the XAI literature.\n\nOpportunity 3: Establish comprehensive benchmarking datasets and evaluation protocols incorporating dynamic biological networks and protein function annotations with language-based medical question answering tasks. This cross-disciplinary benchmark would better measure LLM capabilities in complex real-world domain reasoning and safety, informed by limitations in current MultiMedQA evaluations and the call for responsible AI frameworks."
