By reflecting on the science of perception and related psychological and biological sciences, it gives an account of constitutive conditions for perceiving the physical world, and thus aims to locate origins of representational mind. The book illuminates several long-standing, central issues in philosophy, and provides a wide-ranging account of relations between human and animal psychologies.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'The SAGE Encyclopedia of Educational Research, Measurement, and Evaluation', 'abstract': 'In an era of curricular changes and experiments and high-stakes testing, educational measurement and evaluation is more important than ever. In addition to expected entries covering the basics of traditional theories and methods, other entries discuss important sociopolitical issues and trends influencing the future of that research and practice. Textbooks, handbooks, monographs and other publications focus on various aspects of educational research, measurement and evaluation, but to date, there exists no major reference guide for students new to the field. This comprehensive work fills that gap, covering traditional areas while pointing the way to future developments. Features: Nearly 700 signed entries are contained in an authoritative work spanning four volumes and available in choice of electronic and/or print formats. Although organized A-to-Z, front matter includes a Reader’s Guide grouping entries thematically to help students interested in a specific aspect of education research, measurement, and evaluation to more easily locate directly related entries. (For instance, sample themes include Data, Evaluation, Measurement Concepts & Issues, Research, Sociopolitical Issues, Standards.) Back matter includes a Chronology of the development of the field; a Resource Guide to classic books, journals, and associations; and a detailed Index. Entries conclude with References/Further Readings and Cross References to related entries.

Recommender systems have proven to be a valuable way for online users to cope with the information overload and have become one of the most powerful and popular tools in electronic commerce. Correspondingly, various techniques for recommendation generation have been proposed. During the last decade, many of them have also been successfully deployed in commercial environments. Recommender Systems Handbook, an edited volume, is a multi-disciplinary effort that involves world-wide experts from diverse fields, such as artificial intelligence, human computer interaction, information technology, data mining, statistics, adaptive user interfaces, decision support systems, marketing, and consumer behavior. Theoreticiansand practitioners from these fields continually seek techniques for more efficient, cost-effective and accurate recommender systems. This handbook aims to impose a degree of order on this diversity, by presenting a coherent and unified repository of recommender systems’ major concepts, theories, methodologies, trends, challenges and applications. Extensive artificial applications, a variety of real-world applications, and detailed case studies are included. Recommender Systems Handbook illustrates how this technology can support the user in decision-making, planning and purchasing processes.

    "current_research_landscape": "The core research cluster synthesized from foundational literature and local concept topology reveals a multidisciplinary nexus centered around enhancing computational models' ability to understand and represent the physical world through advanced methods such as computational neuroscience frameworks, educational and mixed methods research, and adaptive recommender systems. Central nodes like 'field of computational neuroscience', 'mixed methods research', and 'recommender systems' indicate the dominant focus on leveraging inter-disciplinary perspectives and methodological pluralism to model cognition and perception relevant to prompt engineering. The core problem addressed is how to effectively encode and utilize various forms of knowledge, including perceptual and domain-specific information, within large language models (LLMs) for improved few-shot learning and prompt responsiveness. Thematic islands highlight clusters around expert editorial curation of interdisciplinary knowledge, mixed methodologies emphasizing diverse pedagogical tools and learning objectives, perception of the physical world, and adaptive interfaces exemplified by recommender systems. Dominant methods integrate computational modeling grounded in neuroscience principles, mixed qualitative-quantitative research approaches, and AI-driven user adaptive recommendation techniques, aiming to scaffold LLM knowledge retrieval and prompt adaptation in data-sparse scenarios.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps emerge from the bridge nodes connecting 'mixed methods research' and 'methods research', indicating a fragmentation or under-integration between methodological approaches that hinders coherent framework development for knowledge base integration in LLM prompt engineering. The foundational papers reflect limitations such as insufficient handling of complex, multi-modal physical world representations and challenges in scaling adaptivity across diverse, heterogeneous knowledge sources. There are also underexplored variations in pedagogical strategies to optimize few-shot learning efficacy. Externally, the global GPS analysis highlights underutilized cross-disciplinary bridges, notably between 'expert editors' and 'mixed methods research', suggesting a missing synergy between curated expert knowledge and systematic mixed methodologies. Another overlooked connection is between 'mixed methods research' and 'recommender systems', which potentially could inform personalized knowledge retrieval mechanisms within LLMs. These hidden bridges imply opportunities to merge structured expert curation with methodologically rigorous, human-centered data integration, and adaptive recommendation to address knowledge quality, relevance, and contextual appropriateness in LLM prompting.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate expert editorial frameworks (hidden bridge between 'expert editors' and 'mixed methods research') with current mixed methods approaches in prompt engineering to develop robust, validated knowledge base curation pipelines enhancing the quality and reliability of background knowledge for few-shot learning.\n\nOpportunity 2: Combine human-centered design principles and adaptive recommender system models (bridge between 'mixed methods research' and 'recommender systems') to innovate personalized prompt adaptation systems that dynamically tailor knowledge retrieval and prompt constructs based on user interaction patterns and contextual feedback, addressing internal gaps in adaptive user interface and method integration.\n\nOpportunity 3: Leverage interdisciplinary insights from computational neuroscience (central node) with novel mixed methods and recommender systems approaches to model multi-modal perception of the physical world, thereby improving LLMs' ability to ground prompts in richly represented, context-aware environmental knowledge, filling the internal limitation of insufficient physical world representation and enhancing semantic grounding for few-shot learning in complex domains."
