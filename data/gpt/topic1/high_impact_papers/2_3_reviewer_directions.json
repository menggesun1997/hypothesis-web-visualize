    "title": "Hybrid Methodological Framework for Coherent Knowledge Base Integration in LLM Prompt Engineering",
    "Problem_Statement": "Fragmentation between mixed methods research and methods research hinders the development of coherent frameworks integrating heterogeneous knowledge bases into LLM prompts effectively.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the critical internal gap caused by the fragmentation between mixed methods and methods research nodes, proposing a unifying framework that harmonizes methodological pluralism to systematically integrate diverse knowledge types into prompts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid meta-framework combining structured qualitative thematic analysis with quantitative embedding alignment. This framework operationalizes stepwise integration of curated expert knowledge and data-driven insights into prompt structures. It incorporates iterative human-in-the-loop validation phases, methodological triangulation for reliability, and adaptive adjustment mechanisms to reconcile inconsistencies between knowledge source types effectively.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Identify heterogeneous knowledge bases relevant for LLM prompting.\n2) Apply qualitative analysis to categorize knowledge themes.\n3) Align themes with quantitative embedding vectors.\n4) Construct hybrid prompts integrating both.\n5) Empirically evaluate impact on few-shot learning benchmark tasks.\nMetrics: integration coherence, task performance, methodological robustness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Domain-specific prompts combining textual expert summaries and structured datasets.\nExpected Output: Enhanced task performance via coherently integrated prompt content validated qualitatively and quantitatively.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If integration proves inconsistent, develop domain-specific subframeworks or prioritize one methodological mode per task context with adaptive switching."

In particular, explicit algorithms or procedural steps on aligning qualitative themes with quantitative embeddings and managing conflicts between data-driven and expert knowledge are needed to establish methodological clarity and reproducibility. Strengthen this section by providing more concrete descriptions or examples of the integration process and the iterative human-in-the-loop validation phases to ensure a sound mechanism underpinning the framework's effectiveness and coherence in LLM prompting contexts. This will help reviewers and practitioners better understand the feasibility and reproducibility of the approach, reducing ambiguity in execution and evaluation stages.

Clarify the experimental design by specifying concrete methodologies for qualitative and quantitative validation, dataset selection criteria, benchmark task descriptions, controls, and baselines for assessing few-shot learning performance improvements attributable to prompt integration. Furthermore, discuss potential challenges such as variability in expert knowledge sources and embedding space alignment. This will enhance the practical feasibility and reproducibility of the experiments, allowing clear assessment of the framework's effectiveness and robustness in real-world LLM prompt engineering environments.
