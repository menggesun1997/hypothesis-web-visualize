        "title": "Federated Knowledge-Driven Fairness Metrics for LLMs in Sensitive Communication",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs suffer from bias and fairness issues, especially when mediating sensitive communication content. Existing fairness frameworks lack incorporation of federated learning and structured knowledge bases from health AI, limiting the ability to mitigate biases in decentralized, privacy-sensitive contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the critical internal gap of limited focus on combining structured knowledge bases with fairness methods and incorporates the external novel gap of federated learning from healthcare AI. This synthesis creates a new framework for bias mitigation in LLMs that handle sensitive socio-cultural communication data without compromising privacy.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a federated learning system where multiple institutions train individual LLM components augmented by knowledge bases encoding fairness metrics adapted from health AI. Each node incorporates structured ontologies capturing socio-cultural fairness nuances and collaboratively learns bias detection and mitigation techniques without sharing raw data. The system integrates fairness loss functions derived from healthcare fairness metrics to guide learning towards equitable language generation in communication contexts.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect communication datasets with socio-cultural diversity (social media posts, news articles).\n2) Construct structured knowledge bases representing fairness definitions and socio-cultural contexts.\n3) Implement federated learning with local nodes training LLMs augmented with these knowledge bases.\n4) Apply fairness metric loss functions inspired by healthcare AI.\n5) Evaluate bias reduction and fairness improvements against centralized baseline models on held-out communication data.\n6) Use standard fairness metrics (equalized odds, disparate impact) and new metrics capturing communication effectiveness and ethical compliance.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A social media post discussing immigration policies.\nExpected Output: The LLM generates a response that is balanced, free from stereotypical bias, with language respectful of multiple cultural perspectives, measured by improved fairness scores compared to baseline.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated learning convergence issues arise, fallback to a centralized training approach with strict privacy-preserving synthetic data generation. Alternatively, adapt standard fairness metrics for more tractable optimization or reduce knowledge base complexity for stability."

        "title": "Ethnographically-Informed Symbolic Knowledge Injection for Bias Mitigation in LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Most LLM fairness approaches lack deeper sociocultural understanding, risking superficial bias mitigation that misses embedded systemic issues. A gap exists in integrating ethnographic communication research with technical AI fairness methods in LLMs.",
        "Motivation": "Directly addresses the internal gap of the missing nexus between communication research and algorithmic fairness by pioneering an approach that injects ethnographic findings as symbolic knowledge into LLMs for fairness improvements, creating an interdisciplinary evaluative and mitigation tool.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Leverage ethnographic studies to extract symbolic knowledge rules about communication fairness and bias contexts. Encode these into rule-based knowledge graphs integrated with LLM training and inference pipelines as guidance constraints. During generation, model biases are penalized according to violations of these rules, effectively grounding fairness in sociocultural realities documented by communication research.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select representative ethnographic studies focusing on bias and communication.\n2) Manually curate symbolic fairness knowledge graphs encoding norms and anti-bias principles.\n3) Integrate these graphs via neuro-symbolic methods into LLM fine-tuning.\n4) Benchmark against state-of-the-art bias mitigation LLMs on communication datasets.\n5) Evaluate both quantitative bias metrics and qualitative sociocultural fairness assessments by expert panels.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A news report discussing gender roles.\nExpected Output: The generated text observes culturally sensitive fairness rules such as avoiding stereotypical gender assumptions and appropriately representing diverse voices, with model outputs aligned to ethnographic constraints.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If symbolic integration hamstrings fluency, switch to soft constraint regularizers or reinforcement learning with human-in-the-loop feedback derived from ethnographic experts."

        "title": "Cross-Domain Fairness Metric Transfer Learning from Healthcare to Communication LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Fairness metrics developed for healthcare AI have not been systematically adapted or validated for use in communication-focused LLMs, resulting in a missed opportunity for improved bias measurement and mitigation.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap by transferring and adapting rigorous healthcare fairness metrics to communication AI, creating a robust, domain-sensitive evaluation suite that better detects subtler bias forms relevant to media and communication environments.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a transfer learning framework that fine-tunes healthcare fairness metrics, originally validated on medical datasets, to the communication domain. This includes mapping domain-specific variables, recalibrating metric thresholds for sociocultural contexts, and integrating these metrics into LLM training as differentiable loss components for bias mitigation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Catalog healthcare fairness metrics (e.g., individual fairness, counterfactual fairness).\n2) Curate communication datasets with annotated bias instances.\n3) Use domain adaptation techniques to recalibrate metrics.\n4) Incorporate adapted metrics into LLM training loops.\n5) Evaluate improvements over existing communication fairness metrics with human and algorithmic assessments.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Chatbot responses to potentially sensitive questions about ethnicity.\nExpected Output: Responses with reduced biased stereotyping and higher scores on transferred fairness metrics compared to unadapted baselines.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct transfer underperforms, develop hybrid composite metrics blending healthcare and communication fairness measures or collect specialized communication domain fairness annotations to retrain metrics."

        "title": "Federated Decentralized Knowledge Base Augmentation for Privacy-Preserving Bias Reduction in LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLMs lack access to large, diverse, structured knowledge bases for bias mitigation due to privacy and data sharing limitations.",
        "Motivation": "Responds to the identified internal and external gaps by innovating on federated learning platforms from healthcare AI to enable decentralized knowledge base augmentation that enhances LLM fairness without violating data privacy in sensitive communication domains.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a federated network of knowledge bases distributed across communication platforms and institutions. Each local knowledge base contains privacy-sensitive but structured fairness-relevant knowledge. Federated updates allow LLMs to learn from this aggregate knowledge without centralizing data. The architecture uses privacy-preserving protocols and differential privacy to maintain confidentiality while improving bias mitigation knowledge.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop synthetic federated communication knowledge bases capturing diverse fairness concepts.\n2) Establish federated training pipeline enhancing LLM knowledge prior to language generation.\n3) Compare fairness levels between models trained with centralized versus federated knowledge base access.\n4) Measure privacy guarantees and degradation in performance.\n5) Test scalability and adapt to real-world institutional collaboration scenarios.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user query involving politically sensitive content.\nExpected Output: The LLM responds with balanced information drawing from federated diverse knowledge bases, avoiding biased or inflammatory language, with privacy preserved for all contributor nodes.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated synchronization fails, fallback to periodic knowledge distillation from local knowledge bases to a privacy-preserving centralized model, or introduce secure multiparty computation techniques."

        "title": "Socio-Technically Integrated Bias Auditing Framework for LLMs in Media Studies",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM bias audits focus narrowly on technical metrics without integrating rich social science evaluation methodologies, leading to incomplete assessments of societal impact.",
        "Motivation": "Bridges gaps between communication ethnography, media studies, and technical AI fairness methods by developing a joint evaluation framework that combines sociocultural qualitative methods with quantitative AI bias audits, providing fuller insight into LLM fairness and ethical implications.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid audit framework including computational fairness metrics, ethnographic coding schemas, sentiment and discourse analysis tools, and participatory evaluation sessions with affected communities. This system incorporates communication research techniques to contextualize quantitative bias findings, yielding nuanced bias impact profiles per domain and population.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select communication datasets and LLMs deployed in media-related contexts.\n2) Apply automated quantitative bias metrics.\n3) Perform ethnographic content analysis on generated outputs.\n4) Conduct participatory workshops collecting stakeholder feedback.\n5) Correlate findings to refine fairness auditing tools and model training adjustments.\n6) Iterate audit-feedback loop to improve overall fairness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An LLM-generated news summary on race relations.\nExpected Output: Audit results detail not only algorithmic bias scores but ethnographic assessment of narrative framing and community perceptions, enabling richer fairness insights.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If human-in-the-loop evaluations are expensive or slow, develop proxy metrics validated against ethnographic insights to automate parts of the framework."
