        "title": "Graph-Infused Language Models for Protein Interaction Reasoning",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on biological texts often fail to fully leverage rich relational domain knowledge encoded in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, resulting in limited biological reasoning and reduced factual accuracy in downstream protein function prediction and related tasks.",
        "Motivation": "While existing multimodal approaches combine language and structured data, the direct, fine-grained alignment of heterogeneous biological graph structures with sequential textual inputs remains underexplored. This work aims to bridge this gap by designing a novel graph-infused LLM architecture that tightly integrates PPI network embeddings to enhance LLMs' capacity for relational biological reasoning. By leveraging advances in graph neural networks (GNNs), network biology, and natural language processing, we pursue a solution that both respects the distinct topologies of PPI graphs and preserves the powerful contextual understanding of advanced LLMs, thus pushing the frontier of domain-informed AI models for biomedical applications.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-stage architecture involving: \n\n1. **Protein Graph Embedding Module:** Utilize a biologically-informed heterogeneous GNN tailored to PPI networks (e.g., Heterogeneous Graph Transformer) incorporating node features such as protein sequence embeddings, structural annotations, and interaction types. Training optimizes a combined objective of link prediction and biological property prediction, ensuring embeddings capture both local and global network semantics.\n\n2. **Sequence-to-Graph Token Alignment:** Develop an alignment mechanism that maps protein mentions in input text to corresponding graph nodes via a named entity recognition and linking pipeline, leveraging domain expert-curated dictionaries and canonical protein identifiers.\n\n3. **Cross-Attention Fusion Architecture:** Inside the LLM fine-tuning process (e.g., PaLM), insert specialized cross-attention layers at selected Transformer blocks where language token embeddings attend to graph node embeddings representing proteins in the prompt context. The cross-attention mechanism is designed so that for each protein token, its query vector is matched with key/value pairs from corresponding graph embeddings. Non-protein tokens use self-attention only, preserving original context modeling. We provide detailed pseudo-code in supplementary materials and visualize the architecture capturing graph-linguistic modality interaction.\n\n4. **Preserving Biological Relational Knowledge:** To maintain PPI topology information, graph embeddings are computed with attention to edge types and higher-order neighborhoods, and their integration into LLM attention is gated by a learnable fusion parameter that balances textual and relational signals to avoid information dilution.\n\n5. **Fine-Tuning and Optimization:** We implement training schedulers and gradient clipping to maintain LLM stability, and perform layer-wise learning rate decay. Hyperparameters determining how graph embeddings affect LLM processing (e.g., fusion weights, attention heads dedicated to graph nodes) are tuned via validation.\n\n6. **Technical Risk Considerations:** To mitigate risks such as context degradation from graph integration or excessive computational cost, we explore sparse attention mechanisms and low-rank graph embedding compression. If direct fusion underperforms, a fallback cross-module ensemble with post-hoc re-ranking informed by GNN outputs will be evaluated.\n\nThis approach innovates beyond prior multimodal GNN-LLM fusions by explicitly modeling protein-to-token alignment and heterogeneous biological graph features within LLM internals, enabling interpretable and functionally relevant knowledge infusion.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. **Dataset Preparation and Harmonization:**\n  - Aggregate PPI data from multiple databases (STRING, BioGRID) with stringent quality control, filtering inconsistencies and harmonizing protein identifiers via UniProt mappings.\n  - Construct a heterogeneous PPI graph including protein nodes, interaction edges labeled by interaction types, and node features such as sequence embeddings (e.g., from ProtBERT) and structural annotations.\n  - Assemble a corpus of biological texts annotated for protein mentions, using biomedical NER tools and domain expert verification for accurate entity linking.\n\n2. **Graph Neural Network Training:**\n  - Design and train a heterogeneous GNN with mechanisms for edge-type-specific attention and multi-hop neighborhood aggregation.\n  - Use a multi-task loss combining PPI link prediction, functional annotation prediction, and contrastive learning to embed biological semantics into protein node vectors.\n  - Validate embeddings with standard PPI prediction metrics and biological property classification accuracy.\n\n3. **LLM and Graph Fusion Development:**\n  - Implement token-to-protein linking in prompts using a custom NER and linking pipeline.\n  - Insert custom cross-attention layers in LLM architecture (e.g., PaLM) that enable protein tokens to attend to GNN embeddings.\n  - Fine-tune the model on combined biological text and graph embedding inputs, employing careful hyperparameter tuning for fusion weights.\n  - Incorporate gradient clipping and learning rate scheduling to ensure stable training.\n\n4. **Evaluation Protocol:**\n  - Benchmark on multiple tasks including protein function prediction, scientific question answering, and PPI relation inference to assess the breadth of the model's reasoning capabilities.\n  - Extend evaluation to complementary tasks such as pathway prediction and disease association inference to demonstrate generalizable impact.\n  - Compare against baselines including vanilla LLMs, LLMs augmented with classical knowledge graph embeddings, and recent multimodal models.\n\n5. **Ablation and Robustness Studies:**\n  - Systematically remove or vary components such as fusion layers, graph quality, and alignment accuracy to quantify their contributions.\n  - Analyze how different graph embedding methods and GNN architectures affect downstream performance.\n\n6. **Reproducibility and Statistical Rigor:**\n  - Use stratified and multiple random train-test splits with fixed seeds.\n  - Report mean and variance of metrics over multiple runs.\n  - Release code, datasets preprocessing scripts, and model checkpoints publicly.\n\n7. **Resource Management and Fallback Strategies:**\n  - Profile computational cost throughout experimentation; investigate sparse attention and embedding compression if needed.\n  - If direct fusion faces scalability or stability issues, implement fallback ensemble or re-ranking methods integrating LLM and GNN outputs.\n",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What is the functional role of protein TP53 in relation to its interacting partners MDM2 and BAX during apoptosis?\"\nExpected Output: \"Protein TP53 acts as a tumor suppressor regulating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. It interacts with MDM2, which ubiquitinates TP53 inhibiting its activity, and with BAX to promote apoptotic signaling pathways. This relational understanding is derived from integrated PPI network data fused into the language model's reasoning process.\"\n\nInput: \"Explain how protein BRCA1's interaction network influences DNA repair mechanisms.\"\nExpected Output: \"BRCA1 forms complexes with proteins such as RAD51 and BARD1 within the PPI network, coordinating homologous recombination repair. Its interactions modulate the recruitment and activation of DNA repair machinery, as reflected in the fused graph-linguistic model knowledge.\"\n",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct fusion of graph embeddings into LLM cross-attention layers proves impractical due to training instability or computational constraints, we will pivot to a modular approach: fine-tuning separate GNN and LLM models independently and combining their outputs through ensemble strategies or learned weighting schemes. Additionally, a post-hoc re-ranking mechanism will be developed where candidate LLM answers are scored and reordered based on consistency and support from GNN-derived biological knowledge, incorporating domain expert-curated knowledge graph scoring functions. Sparse attention or graph summarization techniques will also be investigated to reduce fusion complexity. These fallback options ensure sustained progress and validate the core hypothesis about enhancing biological reasoning through multi-modal integration."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal's description of integrating graph neural network (GNN) embeddings into the attention layers of a large language model (LLM) lacks sufficient clarity and specificity. It is unclear how graph embeddings will be aligned with language tokens at a granular level, how the bi-modal cross-attention mechanism will be architected, and how this integration preserves biological relational knowledge without degrading LLM context processing. Providing a detailed architectural diagram or pseudo-code, along with an explanation of how graph and language modalities interact during fine-tuning, is essential to assess feasibility and soundness rigorously. Clarification on handling heterogeneous graph topology versus sequential language input is also needed to avoid assumptions that may not hold in practice. Without this, the core mechanism has a risk of being vague and potentially infeasible, especially given known challenges in multimodal fusion at the model internals level. Addressing this will solidify the soundness of the methodological core and highlight where innovation specifically occurs within existing hybrid approaches in the literature (e.g., multimodal GNN-LLM fusion). This is critical since the novelty is hybrid and must be justified with clear technical details and rationale about learned representation alignment capabilities between graph and text domains. Hence, please expand the Proposed_Method section with in-depth architectural and algorithmic details, and discuss potential technical risks upfront to validate core assumptions carefully and transparently.  Targeting this will strengthen confidence in the proposed integration approach and its potential to improve biological reasoning by LLMs reliably.  (See also feasibility feedback.)

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan, while comprehensive, underestimates the complexity of aligning graph embeddings with language models and validating improvements rigorously. For example, the selection and preprocessing of PPI datasets (e.g., STRING, BioGRID) requires considerable domain-specific harmonization and quality control, which is glossed over. Furthermore, training a GNN 'considering both structure and interactions' is vague - the precise GNN architectures, loss functions, and node feature engineering need specification and alignment with biological semantics for feasibility. Also, integrating graph embeddings into cross-attention during LLM fine-tuning may require prohibitively large computational resources and careful hyperparameter tuning; no fallback or mitigation plans are described in the experimental plan itself, only later as fallback conceptual notes. Benchmarking only on protein function prediction and scientific QA datasets is valid but narrow; additional or complementary evaluation on more diverse reasoning or downstream biological tasks would better demonstrate impact. Ablation studies should also explicitly target different fusion strategies and how graph quality affects results. Moreover, comparing against strong baselines beyond vanilla LLMs (e.g., multimodal models or classical knowledge graph embeddings) is crucial to justify contributions. Finally, practical considerations like data splits, reproducibility protocols, and statistical significance assessments are missing but important for scientific soundness. Clarifying and expanding these details will improve the plan's feasibility and the robustness of its claims. This feedback targets experiment plan concreteness and scientific rigor needed to secure credible results.  [FEA-EXPERIMENT]"
