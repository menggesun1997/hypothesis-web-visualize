    "title": "Dynamic Biological Network-Informed Benchmarks for LLM Domain Expertise",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing benchmarks inadequately capture the multidimensional, dynamic nature of biological networks alongside language-based clinical reasoning tasks, limiting effective evaluation of LLM domain expertise and safety.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap about insufficient comprehensive benchmarks by synthesizing domain-specific question answering with evolving biological network annotations to create rigorous evaluation protocols for scientific and medical LLM capabilities.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a benchmark dataset combining temporal protein interaction networks, up-to-date protein function annotations, and complex medical QA pairs derived from structured biological contexts. The benchmark will include tasks assessing reasoning over evolving knowledge graphs, factual consistency, and safety constraints relevant to clinical applications.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Aggregate dynamic PPI data with timestamped functional annotations.\n2. Generate clinical and bioinformatics QA pairs linked explicitly to network evolution events.\n3. Define evaluation metrics including reasoning correctness, temporal consistency, and safety violations.\n4. Release benchmark publicly with baseline LLM and GNN-plus-LLM model results.\n5. Collect community feedback and iterate on benchmark robustness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Given the recent update showing interaction between proteins M and N, does this affect the predicted risk for disease Y in patient cohorts?\"\nExpected Output: \"Yes, the new interaction suggests altered signaling pathways that increase disease Y risk, which should inform updated clinical guidelines.\"",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic data integration proves too complex, start with static snapshots of PPI networks with detailed annotations and gradually incorporate temporal aspects. Alternatively, modularize benchmark tasks by dimension (network reasoning, temporal adaptation, safety testing)."

However, practical challenges such as the scarcity, heterogeneity, and curation difficulty of timestamped, high-quality PPI data may undermine feasibility. The plan should include concrete data sources, clear strategies for reliable temporal annotation, and contingency methods for scaling complexity, beyond the fallback to static snapshots. Additionally, clarity on how evolving knowledge graphs will be concretely represented and validated for benchmarking is needed to avoid ambiguity in implementation and reproducibility challenges. Strengthening this section with detailed methodology and validation protocols will improve feasibility and scientific soundness of the proposed benchmark development process.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the 'NOV-COMPETITIVE' novelty assessment and the domain's existing rich connections, the idea can achieve stronger impact and novelty by explicitly integrating state-of-the-art knowledge graph techniques and leveraging natural language processing advances, such as cognitive psychology-inspired reasoning or visual question answering paradigms. For instance, extending the benchmark to include multimodal inputs (e.g., visualizations of dynamic networks) or interactive question answering that mimics clinical decision-making workflows could differentiate this work. Moreover, embedding interpretability or explainability modules within models evaluated on this benchmark would align with safety concerns and broaden community interest, thereby enhancing both scientific contribution and practical relevance."
