    "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Mixed Methodology Toolkit for Knowledge Base Enhancement in LLM Prompt Engineering",
    "Problem_Statement": "Insufficient integration of human qualitative insights with computational methods hampers continuous improvement of knowledge bases used in prompt engineering for few-shot learning.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the under-integration between mixed methods research and knowledge base development by creating an interactive toolkit enabling seamless incorporation of human qualitative evaluations with quantitative data-driven updates.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a suite combining qualitative survey modules, annotation interfaces, and visualization tools linked with LLM prompt backend. It allows experts and users to provide structured feedback on knowledge base content and prompt effectiveness. Feedback loops automatically adjust knowledge base weights and prompt templates using mixed methods analytics, fostering continuous adaptation and optimization.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build qualitative survey instruments and annotation platform.\n2) Link feedback to knowledge base scoring and prompt template parameters.\n3) Pilot with domain experts and novice users on few-shot tasks.\n4) Analyze mixed data streams to identify improvement areas.\n5) Iterate knowledge base and prompt adjustment cycles.\nMetrics: feedback quality, knowledge base improvement rate, prompt task gains.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User feedback indicating partial knowledge incompleteness for a domain prompt.\nExpected Output: Knowledge base update and prompt template modification improving response completeness.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If feedback volume or quality is low, incentivize participation and introduce automated quality checks or AI-assisted annotation support."

However, the mechanism by which mixed methods analytics quantitatively adjust knowledge base weights and prompt templates is not sufficiently specified. Clarify the concrete algorithms or statistical approaches to integrate qualitative feedback into the knowledge base scoring and prompt adaptation. Providing specific examples or a formalized workflow for this automatic feedback loop will enhance trust in soundness and reproducibility of the method. For example, describe how qualitative annotations map to quantitative updates or how conflicting feedback is resolved within the system's logic framework, ensuring methodological clarity and validity of the core mechanism. This is crucial given the interplay between human input and automated prompt engineering proposed here, which is both novel and complex in practice. This feedback targets the \"Proposed_Method\" section for clearer operational detail and reasoning verification."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is generally sound but lacks detail on ensuring sufficient and representative qualitative feedback volume and quality, which are critical for mixed methods. Step 5 mentions iteration but does not specify criteria or statistical measures to evaluate improvement cycles (e.g., convergence criteria, effect size thresholds). Furthermore, the fallback plan should be elaborated into contingency experimental designs—such as controlled user studies with incentives or AI-assisted annotation comparisons—to guarantee data sufficiency and reliability rather than ad-hoc fixes. Including precise metrics on sample sizes, data balancing between expert and novice users, and validation of the annotation platform’s usability would strengthen feasibility. This feedback is directed at the \"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\" section to improve the experimental rigor and practical execution assurance."
