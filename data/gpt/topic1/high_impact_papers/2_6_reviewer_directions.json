    "title": "Pedagogical Strategy-Driven Prompt Architecture for Optimizing Few-Shot Learning in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is an underexplored variation in pedagogical strategies to optimize few-shot learning effectiveness using prompt engineering, especially under complex multi-modal knowledge scenarios.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap concerning heterogeneous pedagogical approaches by integrating educational mixed methods research into prompt design to systematically optimize learning outcomes of LLM few-shot tasks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a framework that models pedagogical theories (e.g., scaffolding, spaced repetition, cognitive load management) into prompt construction algorithms. Prompts are dynamically generated and adapted based on pedagogical objectives, learner modeling, and knowledge base characteristics. Mixed methods evaluate pedagogical efficacy through both qualitative learner feedback and quantitative task metrics.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Survey pedagogical strategies relevant for few-shot learning.\n2) Encode strategies into prompt template generation rules.\n3) Deploy on LLM few-shot tasks with user simulations and real users.\n4) Collect mixed method data (qualitative feedback, performance metrics).\n5) Refine prompt adaptation algorithms iteratively.\nMetrics: learning gain, user satisfaction, prompt efficiency.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Science education prompts that incrementally scaffold complex concept understanding.\nExpected Output: Enhanced learner comprehension and retention demonstrated via more accurate generated explanations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If pedagogical prompt designs prove ineffective, switch to hybrid strategies combining conventional prompt engineering with pedagogical cues or involve adaptive user feedback loops."
