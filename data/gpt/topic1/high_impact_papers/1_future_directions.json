        "title": "Graph-Infused Language Models for Protein Interaction Reasoning",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLMs fine-tuned on domain-specific knowledge often lack the ability to utilize relational biological data, such as protein-protein interaction networks, leading to deficiencies in domain reasoning and factual accuracy.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap of underutilized multi-relational graph embeddings in LLM fine-tuning by leveraging the hidden bridge between protein structure prediction and network data to improve biological reasoning capabilities of LLMs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an architecture that integrates graph neural network-based embeddings derived from protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks directly into the attention layers of an LLM during fine-tuning. This bi-modal fusion aligns language tokens with graph nodes representing proteins and their interactions, creating contextually enriched representations that preserve relational biological knowledge.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect high-quality PPI datasets (e.g., STRING, BioGRID) and biological texts describing protein functions.\n2. Train a graph neural network (GNN) to generate embeddings for proteins considering both structure and interactions.\n3. Fine-tune a pretrained LLM (e.g., PaLM) by conditioning input prompts with graph embeddings integrated via a cross-attention mechanism.\n4. Benchmark on protein function prediction and scientific question answering datasets.\n5. Evaluate performance improvements in accuracy, reasoning, and factuality versus baselines without graph integration.\n6. Conduct ablation studies to assess contribution of graph embeddings.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What is the functional role of protein X in the context of its neighboring proteins Y and Z?\"\nExpected Output: \"Protein X is involved in cellular signaling pathways and interacts with proteins Y and Z to regulate apoptotic processes, as evidenced by PPI network data integrated into the model.\"",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct integration of graph embeddings disrupts LLM training, fallback to post-hoc re-ranking of LLM outputs using a GNN-informed knowledge scoring module. Alternatively, fine-tune separate GNN and LLM modules and combine their outputs via an ensemble approach for final predictions."

        "title": "Explainable Hybrid Network-Language Models for Clinical Expertise",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current fine-tuned LLMs for clinical tasks suffer from poor explainability and trustworthiness, limiting their adoption in sensitive medical domains.",
        "Motivation": "Directly tackles the internal gap in explainability and the trust issues noted in Clinical LLM evaluation by creating a hybrid architecture that combines network analytical models with explicit prompt tuning strategies to generate interpretable and safe domain expertise outputs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a hybrid model where the LLM is guided by an interpretable network-based reasoning engine that encodes clinical relations (e.g., disease-drug, symptom-diagnosis graphs). The pipeline utilizes instruction prompt tuning complemented by structured graph constraints and produces rationale explanations alongside predictions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Construct a clinical knowledge graph from curated biomedical ontologies.\n2. Develop a network reasoning engine that infers paths and relations relevant to query inputs.\n3. Implement instruction prompt tuning to embed network reasoning outputs as rationale prompts for the LLM.\n4. Test on clinical QA datasets requiring explanation of reasoning steps.\n5. Compare explanations and answer accuracy against vanilla fine-tuned LLMs.\n6. Evaluate trust and safety metrics using human expert review and adversarial testing.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Explain why medication A is recommended for symptom B in patient C.\"\nExpected Output: \"Medication A targets the receptor implicated in symptom B by blocking pathway X, supported by clinical network relations and evidence embedded in the reasoning engine.\"",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If integration leads to degraded LLM accuracy or explanation coherence, switch to a post-inference explanation generator module trained on the LLM's outputs combined with network features, employing attention visualization and logic rule extraction methods."

        "title": "Dynamic Biological Network-Informed Benchmarks for LLM Domain Expertise",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing benchmarks inadequately capture the multidimensional, dynamic nature of biological networks alongside language-based clinical reasoning tasks, limiting effective evaluation of LLM domain expertise and safety.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap about insufficient comprehensive benchmarks by synthesizing domain-specific question answering with evolving biological network annotations to create rigorous evaluation protocols for scientific and medical LLM capabilities.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create a benchmark dataset combining temporal protein interaction networks, up-to-date protein function annotations, and complex medical QA pairs derived from structured biological contexts. The benchmark will include tasks assessing reasoning over evolving knowledge graphs, factual consistency, and safety constraints relevant to clinical applications.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Aggregate dynamic PPI data with timestamped functional annotations.\n2. Generate clinical and bioinformatics QA pairs linked explicitly to network evolution events.\n3. Define evaluation metrics including reasoning correctness, temporal consistency, and safety violations.\n4. Release benchmark publicly with baseline LLM and GNN-plus-LLM model results.\n5. Collect community feedback and iterate on benchmark robustness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Given the recent update showing interaction between proteins M and N, does this affect the predicted risk for disease Y in patient cohorts?\"\nExpected Output: \"Yes, the new interaction suggests altered signaling pathways that increase disease Y risk, which should inform updated clinical guidelines.\"",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic data integration proves too complex, start with static snapshots of PPI networks with detailed annotations and gradually incorporate temporal aspects. Alternatively, modularize benchmark tasks by dimension (network reasoning, temporal adaptation, safety testing)."

        "title": "Cross-Modal Relational Embedding Augmentation for Scientific LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLMs struggle to fully integrate structural biology knowledge with linguistic context due to modality misalignment and lack of integrated relational embeddings.",
        "Motivation": "Fills the critical gap on leveraging multi-relational graph embeddings by proposing novel cross-modal alignment techniques that transform protein network embeddings into a language-compatible latent space for fine-tuning LLMs, improving domain comprehension and reasoning.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design an embedding augmentation framework that performs projection and alignment of graph-based protein interaction embeddings into the LLM embedding space via contrastive learning and modality translation layers. This aligned embedding is then used as auxiliary input during LLM fine-tuning to enhance contextual grounding in biological structure.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Obtain paired biological texts and corresponding protein interaction graphs.\n2. Train a graph encoder and language encoder jointly with cross-modal objectives to align embedding spaces.\n3. Fine-tune LLM with aligned graph embeddings concatenated or fused with input token embeddings.\n4. Evaluate on domain-specific reasoning and factuality benchmarks.\n5. Conduct visualization and interpretability analysis of aligned spaces.",

        "Fallback_Plan": "If cross-modal alignment degrades language model fluency, test using gating mechanisms to selectively incorporate graph embeddings or pre-train alignment modules separately before fine-tuning. Alternatively, explore adapter modules for incremental integration."
