    "title": "Graph-Infused Language Models for Protein Interaction Reasoning",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs fine-tuned on domain-specific knowledge often lack the ability to utilize relational biological data, such as protein-protein interaction networks, leading to deficiencies in domain reasoning and factual accuracy.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical gap of underutilized multi-relational graph embeddings in LLM fine-tuning by leveraging the hidden bridge between protein structure prediction and network data to improve biological reasoning capabilities of LLMs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an architecture that integrates graph neural network-based embeddings derived from protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks directly into the attention layers of an LLM during fine-tuning. This bi-modal fusion aligns language tokens with graph nodes representing proteins and their interactions, creating contextually enriched representations that preserve relational biological knowledge.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect high-quality PPI datasets (e.g., STRING, BioGRID) and biological texts describing protein functions.\n2. Train a graph neural network (GNN) to generate embeddings for proteins considering both structure and interactions.\n3. Fine-tune a pretrained LLM (e.g., PaLM) by conditioning input prompts with graph embeddings integrated via a cross-attention mechanism.\n4. Benchmark on protein function prediction and scientific question answering datasets.\n5. Evaluate performance improvements in accuracy, reasoning, and factuality versus baselines without graph integration.\n6. Conduct ablation studies to assess contribution of graph embeddings.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What is the functional role of protein X in the context of its neighboring proteins Y and Z?\"\nExpected Output: \"Protein X is involved in cellular signaling pathways and interacts with proteins Y and Z to regulate apoptotic processes, as evidenced by PPI network data integrated into the model.\"",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct integration of graph embeddings disrupts LLM training, fallback to post-hoc re-ranking of LLM outputs using a GNN-informed knowledge scoring module. Alternatively, fine-tune separate GNN and LLM modules and combine their outputs via an ensemble approach for final predictions."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal's description of integrating graph neural network (GNN) embeddings into the attention layers of a large language model (LLM) lacks sufficient clarity and specificity. It is unclear how graph embeddings will be aligned with language tokens at a granular level, how the bi-modal cross-attention mechanism will be architected, and how this integration preserves biological relational knowledge without degrading LLM context processing. Providing a detailed architectural diagram or pseudo-code, along with an explanation of how graph and language modalities interact during fine-tuning, is essential to assess feasibility and soundness rigorously. Clarification on handling heterogeneous graph topology versus sequential language input is also needed to avoid assumptions that may not hold in practice. Without this, the core mechanism has a risk of being vague and potentially infeasible, especially given known challenges in multimodal fusion at the model internals level. Addressing this will solidify the soundness of the methodological core and highlight where innovation specifically occurs within existing hybrid approaches in the literature (e.g., multimodal GNN-LLM fusion). This is critical since the novelty is hybrid and must be justified with clear technical details and rationale about learned representation alignment capabilities between graph and text domains. Hence, please expand the Proposed_Method section with in-depth architectural and algorithmic details, and discuss potential technical risks upfront to validate core assumptions carefully and transparently.  Targeting this will strengthen confidence in the proposed integration approach and its potential to improve biological reasoning by LLMs reliably.  (See also feasibility feedback.)

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan, while comprehensive, underestimates the complexity of aligning graph embeddings with language models and validating improvements rigorously. For example, the selection and preprocessing of PPI datasets (e.g., STRING, BioGRID) requires considerable domain-specific harmonization and quality control, which is glossed over. Furthermore, training a GNN 'considering both structure and interactions' is vague - the precise GNN architectures, loss functions, and node feature engineering need specification and alignment with biological semantics for feasibility. Also, integrating graph embeddings into cross-attention during LLM fine-tuning may require prohibitively large computational resources and careful hyperparameter tuning; no fallback or mitigation plans are described in the experimental plan itself, only later as fallback conceptual notes. Benchmarking only on protein function prediction and scientific QA datasets is valid but narrow; additional or complementary evaluation on more diverse reasoning or downstream biological tasks would better demonstrate impact. Ablation studies should also explicitly target different fusion strategies and how graph quality affects results. Moreover, comparing against strong baselines beyond vanilla LLMs (e.g., multimodal models or classical knowledge graph embeddings) is crucial to justify contributions. Finally, practical considerations like data splits, reproducibility protocols, and statistical significance assessments are missing but important for scientific soundness. Clarifying and expanding these details will improve the plan's feasibility and the robustness of its claims. This feedback targets experiment plan concreteness and scientific rigor needed to secure credible results.  [FEA-EXPERIMENT]"
