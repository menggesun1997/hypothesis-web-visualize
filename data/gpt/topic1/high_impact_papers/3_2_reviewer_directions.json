    "title": "Cross-Domain Fairness Metric Transfer Learning from Healthcare to Communication LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Fairness metrics developed for healthcare AI have not been systematically adapted or validated for use in communication-focused LLMs, resulting in a missed opportunity for improved bias measurement and mitigation.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap by transferring and adapting rigorous healthcare fairness metrics to communication AI, creating a robust, domain-sensitive evaluation suite that better detects subtler bias forms relevant to media and communication environments.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a transfer learning framework that fine-tunes healthcare fairness metrics, originally validated on medical datasets, to the communication domain. This includes mapping domain-specific variables, recalibrating metric thresholds for sociocultural contexts, and integrating these metrics into LLM training as differentiable loss components for bias mitigation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Catalog healthcare fairness metrics (e.g., individual fairness, counterfactual fairness).\n2) Curate communication datasets with annotated bias instances.\n3) Use domain adaptation techniques to recalibrate metrics.\n4) Incorporate adapted metrics into LLM training loops.\n5) Evaluate improvements over existing communication fairness metrics with human and algorithmic assessments.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Chatbot responses to potentially sensitive questions about ethnicity.\nExpected Output: Responses with reduced biased stereotyping and higher scores on transferred fairness metrics compared to unadapted baselines.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct transfer underperforms, develop hybrid composite metrics blending healthcare and communication fairness measures or collect specialized communication domain fairness annotations to retrain metrics."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that healthcare fairness metrics can be transferred directly to communication-focused LLMs may be overly optimistic without preliminary validation. Healthcare AI fairness metrics are often designed around clinical decision points, patient data characteristics, and medical ethical norms, which differ significantly from the sociocultural dynamics and discourse patterns in communication domains. The proposal should include clear justification or pilot analyses demonstrating the conceptual overlap and transferability of these metrics before developing a full adaptation framework. This would strengthen the foundational validity of the approach and mitigate risks of misaligned fairness criteria in the target domain. Consider adding an initial study on metric suitability and relevance prior to extensive adaptation steps to confirm this critical assumption remains sound and practical in context.\n\n(Suggest adding conceptual analysis or preliminary validation in the Problem Statement or Proposed Method sections.)\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan broadly outlines necessary components but lacks detail on specific domain adaptation techniques and the operationalization of integrating adapted fairness metrics as differentiable loss functions in LLM training. Methodologically, it is unclear how the mapping between healthcare variables and communication domain variables will be constructed or validated, given the highly heterogeneous and noisy nature of communication datasets compared to structured medical datasets. Furthermore, the plan should concretely define evaluation protocols, including baseline selection, human annotation criteria for bias, and statistical validation methods to robustly measure improvements in bias mitigation. To enhance feasibility, refine the experiment plan with clearer technical strategies (e.g., which domain adaptation algorithms or transfer learning methods will be used), dataset curation specifics (size, annotation methods, bias categories), and concrete evaluation metrics and protocols. This will provide a more actionable route from concept to implementation and allow early identification of practical challenges and resource requirements."
