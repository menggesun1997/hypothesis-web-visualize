    "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Multi-Phase Thematic Synthesis Framework",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current communication and media research methodologies struggle to effectively evaluate complex multi-modal media data due to fragmented and siloed approaches, limiting methodological rigor and comprehensive synthesis.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gap of limited integration of multi-phase thematic analysis from health services research into complex content analysis within communication studies, leveraging the hidden bridge identified for enhanced evaluation robustness.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a unified framework that systematically integrates multi-phase thematic analysis protocols (used in health services evaluations) with advanced content analysis techniques tailored for multi-modal media data. This involves automated phase detection, cross-modal theme alignment, and process evaluation metrics embedded within a retrieval-augmented platform to facilitate iterative interpretive cycles.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate multi-modal datasets from communication research (videos, texts, images). 2) Implement baseline content analysis and thematic coding approaches. 3) Incorporate multi-phase thematic modules based on healthcare meta-synthesis protocols. 4) Evaluate on standard metrics such as thematic cohesion, recall of latent themes, and process evaluation robustness. 5) Compare with expert-coded benchmarks to assess qualitative rigor.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A dataset of public health campaign videos and social media posts discussing vaccination. Expected Output: Identification of multi-layered themes (emotional appeals, misinformation patterns, outreach strategies) through distinct phases reflecting initial narrative framing to public reception stages, with quantified evaluation of theme evolution and coherence.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If automatic phase detection underperforms, fallback to semi-supervised phase annotation with domain experts. Alternatively, trial simplified uni-phase thematic aggregation with cross-validation on manual coding sets."
