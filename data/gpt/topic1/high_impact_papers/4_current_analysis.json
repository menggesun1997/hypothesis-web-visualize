The rise of the Internet and the wide availability of inexpensive computers have made it possible to gather and analyze network data on a large scale, and the development of a variety of new theoretical tools has allowed us to extract new knowledge from many different kinds of networks. The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and important developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social sciences. This book brings together the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas. Subjects covered include the measurement and structure of networks in many branches of science, methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology, the fundamentals of graph theory, computer algorithms, and spectral methods, mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models, and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Modern Applied Statistics with S', 'abstract': 'S is a powerful environment for the statistical and graphical analysis of data. It provides the tools to implement many statistical ideas that have been made possible by the widespread availability of workstations having good graphics and computational capabilities. This book is a guide to using S environments to perform statistical analyses and provides both an introduction to the use of S and a course in modern statistical methods. Implementations of S are available commercially in S-PLUS(R) workstations and as the Open Source R for a wide range of computer systems. The aim of this book is to show how to use S as a powerful and graphical data analysis system. Readers are assumed to have a basic grounding in statistics, and so the book is intended for would-be users of S-PLUS or R and both students and researchers using statistics. Throughout, the emphasis is on presenting practical problems and full analyses of real data sets. Many of the methods discussed are state of the art approaches to topics such as linear, nonlinear and smooth regression models, tree-based methods, multivariate analysis, pattern recognition, survival analysis, time series and spatial statistics. Throughout modern techniques such as robust methods, non-parametric smoothing and bootstrapping are used where appropriate. This fourth edition is intended for users of S-PLUS 6.0 or R 1.5.0 or later. A substantial change from the third edition is updating for the current versions of S-PLUS and adding coverage of R. The introductory material has been rewritten to emphasis the import, export and manipulation of data. Increased computational power allows even more computer-intensive methods to be used, and methods such as GLMMs,'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'The Elements of Statistical Learning, Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction', 'abstract': \"During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology.

For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Switching in Systems and Control', 'abstract': 'This book examines switched systems from a control-theoretic perspective, focusing on stability analysis and control synthesis of systems that combine continuous dynamics with switching events. The theory of such switched systems is related to the study of hybrid systems, which has recently attracted considerable attention among control theorists, computer scientists, and practicing engineers. Aimed at readers with a background in systems and control, this book bridges the gap between classical mathematical control theory and the interdisciplinary field of hybrid systems. The book is divided into three main parts: * Part I introduces the classes of systems studied in the book * Part II develops stability theory for switched systems; it covers single and multiple Lyapunov function analysis methods, Lie-algebraic stability criteria, stability under limited-rate switching, and switched systems with various types of useful special structures * Part III is devoted to switching control design; it describes several wide classes of continuous-time control systems for which the logic-based switching paradigm emerges naturally as a control design tool. Switching control algorithms for several specific problems are discussed. The text adopts a progressive approach, presenting elementary concepts informally and more advanced topics with greater rigor. Results are first derived for linear systems and then extended to nonlinear systems. Full proofs for most results are provided. An extensive bibliography and a section of technical and historical notes complete the work. Requiring only familiarity with the basic theory of linear systems, the book is suitable as a text for a graduate course on switched systems and switching control. It may also serve as an introduction to this active area of research for control theorists and mathematicians, as well as a useful reference for experts in the field.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Advances and Open Problems in Federated Learning', 'abstract': 'Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning setting where many clients (e.g., mobile devices or whole organizations) collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central server (e.g., service provider), while keeping the training data decentralized. FL embodies the principles of focused data collection and minimization, and can mitigate many of the systemic privacy risks and costs resulting from traditional, centralized machine learning and data science approaches. Motivated by the explosive growth in FL research, this monograph discusses recent advances and presents an extensive collection of open problems and challenges.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Self-Organizing Maps', 'abstract': 'The Self-Organizing Map (SOM), with its variants, is the most popular artificial neural network algorithm in the unsupervised learning category. About 4000 research articles on it have appeared in the open literature, and many industrial projects use the SOM as a tool for solving hard real-world problems. Many fields of science have adopted the SOM as a standard analytical tool: in statistics, signal processing, control theory, financial analyses, experimental physics, chemistry and medicine. The SOM solves difficult high-dimensional and nonlinear problems such as feature extraction and classification of images and acoustic patterns, adaptive control of robots, and equalization, demodulation, and error-tolerant transmission of signals in telecommunications. A new area is organization of very large document collections. Last but not least, it may be mentioned that the SOM is one of the most realistic models of the biological brain function. This new edition includes a survey of over 2000 contemporary studies to cover the newest results; case examples were provided with detailed formulae, illustrations, and tables; a new chapter on Software Tools for SOM was written, other chapters were extended or reorganized.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Sequential Monte Carlo Methods in Practice', 'abstract': 'Monte Carlo methods are revolutionising the on-line analysis of data in fields as diverse as financial modelling, target tracking and computer vision. These methods, appearing under the names of bootstrap filters, condensation, optimal Monte Carlo filters, particle filters and survial of the fittest, have made it possible to solve numerically many complex, non-standarard problems that were previously intractable. This book presents the first comprehensive treatment of these techniques, including convergence results and applications to tracking, guidance, automated target recognition, aircraft navigation, robot navigation, econometrics, financial modelling, neural networks,optimal control, optimal filtering, communications, reinforcement learning, signal enhancement, model averaging and selection, computer vision, semiconductor design, population biology, dynamic Bayesian networks, and time series analysis.

Publilius Syrus, Moral Sayings We've been very fortunate to receive fantastic feedback from our readers during the last four years, since the first edition of How to Solve It: Modern Heuristics was published in 1999. It's heartening to know that so many people appreciated the book and, even more importantly, were using the book to help them solve their problems. One professor, who published a review of the book, said that his students had given the best course reviews he'd seen in 15 years when using our text. There can be hardly any better praise, except to add that one of the book reviews published in a SIAM journal received the best review award as well.

The central problem addresses how to process, manipulate, and analyze vast, heterogeneous data efficiently to support reasoning and inference, especially over long-term temporal scales. Dominant methods include advanced statistical and machine learning techniques such as neural networks, ensemble methods, and graphical models, supported by increasing computational power and sophisticated data analysis systems (e.g., S and R environments). Thematic islands reveal a dual emphasis: (1) understanding and modeling network data structures and dynamics to extract meaningful insights and (2) robust data manipulation and analysis facilitated by computational resources. However, within these foundational works, there is limited explicit focus on integrating structured knowledge bases for memory-enhancement in large language models (LLMs) aimed at sustained, efficient reasoning.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: The lack of explicit bridge nodes within the local concept network highlights a fragmentation between data manipulation technologies and network knowledge modeling. Foundational papers also point to challenges in scalable, interpretable models capable of handling 'wide' and complex data with long-term dependencies. Furthermore, existing statistical and machine learning approaches do not fully address the explainability and memory integration needed for persistent, efficient inference. External/Novel Gaps: The GPS global context reveals a critical hidden bridge linking 'network data' to advanced 'manipulation of data' via state-of-the-art deep learning paradigms (e.g., convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks, reinforcement learning). This suggests an overlooked opportunity to utilize advanced neural architectures and ensemble learning mechanisms to augment knowledge base integration and dynamic memory retrieval in LLMs. Moreover, leveraging human language network concepts and lexical-semantic modeling within network data analysis offers a novel interdisciplinary path to enhance semantic coherence and reasoning depth in memory-augmented models, which has not been exploited in the current foundation.",
