    "title": "Expert Curation-Driven Adaptive Pipeline for Knowledge Base Quality in LLM Prompting",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current prompt engineering methods lack scalable, validated pipelines to ensure quality and reliability of knowledge bases, especially for few-shot learning contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by Opportunity 1's integration of expert editorial frameworks with mixed methods to bridge gaps in knowledge curation pipelines, proposing a transformative end-to-end pipeline embedding expert validation systematically.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an adaptive curation pipeline where knowledge bases undergo iterative expert editorial phases supported by mixed qualitative-quantitative validation tools. Automated anomaly detection flags inconsistencies, while human experts provide corrective annotations. The pipeline feeds dynamically into LLM prompt construction, enhancing knowledge fidelity and enabling continuous quality improvement through feedback loops.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble knowledge bases across domains.\n2) Deploy expert panels for editorial review using digital annotation platforms.\n3) Implement consistency and quality metrics guided by mixed methods.\n4) Integrate curated knowledge dynamically into prompts.\n5) Benchmark few-shot learning performance pre/post curation.\nMetrics: knowledge accuracy, prompt task success, editorial efficiency.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Technical domain prompt requiring precise background facts.\nExpected Output: Accurate, reliable responses generated through prompts embedded with rigorously curated knowledge.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If expert scalability is limited, incorporate crowdsourced validation with expert adjudication and develop semi-supervised curation models supplementing human efforts."

          "feedback_content": "While the experiment plan outlines sensible sequential steps, it lacks concrete details regarding scaling, expert panel selection criteria, and quantitative operationalization of the mixed qualitative-quantitative metrics. Providing clearer criteria for expert annotation consistency, specifying how anomaly detection thresholds are set, and elaborating on how dynamic integration into prompts will be technically realized would greatly enhance feasibility assessment and reproducibility. Furthermore, contingency plans for measuring and improving editorial efficiency in practice need clarification under realistic constraints of expert availability and cost models to ensure practical execution at scale, especially given the fallback plan's crowdsourcing suggestion. Enhancing these parts will solidify the experiment plan's scientific robustness and operational viability in real-world scenarios, a necessary step given the proposal’s reliance on iterative expert interventions for quality improvement and LLM downstream performance gains. The target should be a detailed protocol, ideally with prioritized milestones and success criteria, for each experiment phase to enable precise evaluation of pipeline components' effectiveness and cost-benefit trade-offs. This feedback targets the \"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\" section for strengthening scientific and logistical clarity and rigor in planned evaluations to better support execution and impact claims."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment indicating the idea is in a highly competitive space with strong existing links between expert curation, iterative pipelines, and LLM prompting, the proposal could substantially boost impact and distinctiveness by incorporating federated learning concepts. Specifically, using federated learning to enable distributed expert panels contributing editorial annotations and validations without centralizing sensitive or proprietary knowledge bases could increase scalability and privacy compliance. This would address the expert scalability challenge by parallelizing expert input while preserving data confidentiality, aligning with the fallback plan's goal of supplementing human efforts through semi-supervised models. Furthermore, integration of named entity recognition (NER) models could be leveraged within the anomaly detection module to better detect inconsistencies semantically and contextually in curated knowledge bases, thereby improving automated flags’ precision. These integrations would modernize the pipeline, leverage globally linked relevant advances, and position the approach as an innovative hybrid human-AI validation framework well beyond typical manual curation or model fine-tuning strategies. Therefore, augmenting the approach with federated learning and NER techniques is recommended to clearly differentiate from existing competitive methods and significantly enhance both novelty and potential community impact. This suggestion applies broadly but primarily connects to Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan."
