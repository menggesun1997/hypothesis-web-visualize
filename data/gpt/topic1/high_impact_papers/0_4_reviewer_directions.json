    "title": "Embedding eHealth Care Coordination Paradigms into AI-driven Communication Effectiveness Study",
    "Problem_Statement": "AI frameworks analyzing communication effectiveness rarely incorporate structured care coordination concepts, resulting in superficial modelling of interaction quality across media platforms.",
    "Motivation": "Harnesses care coordination frameworks from eHealth research to innovate evaluation paradigms in communication studies to fill critical gaps in outcome-oriented research with computational methodologies.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an AI-powered analytical platform embedding eHealth care coordination metrics (e.g., communication timeliness, information accuracy, role delineation) into multi-media interaction analysis, supported by retrieval-augmented contextual models and advanced graph representation learning to model cross-channel coordination.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Extract care coordination constructs and map to communication behaviors. 2) Collect multi-media communication datasets with interaction logs. 3) Build graph models representing media actors and messages. 4) Integrate retrieval-augmented contextualization for message disambiguation. 5) Measure coordination quality against human annotation benchmarks and behavioral outcomes.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Emergency response multi-platform media communications during a natural disaster. Output: Quantitative scores on coordination efficiency and gaps, highlighting bottlenecks and suggesting improvements for future messaging strategies.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "Fallback to simpler network metrics (e.g., density, centrality) combined with basic retrieval-augmented semantic analysis if the graph learning model underperforms or data is insufficient."

          "feedback_content": "The 'Proposed_Method' outlines promising techniques such as retrieval-augmented contextual models and graph representation learning but lacks a clear, detailed mechanism illustrating how these components will be concretely integrated with the selected eHealth care coordination metrics. Specifically, it is unclear how timeliness, information accuracy, and role delineation measurements will be operationalized and quantitatively embedded into the graph-based models and how retrieval augmentation will directly improve message disambiguation in a multi-media, multi-actor context. I recommend clarifying the data flow, model architecture, and the interpretability of outputs to strengthen methodological soundness and help reviewers and practitioners understand the actual implementation pathway and reasoning behind it. This clarification is essential for demonstrating technical novelty beyond the existing strong related works in this competitive area, ensuring the approach is both novel and well-founded from an AI modeling perspective. Target: Proposed_Method."

          "feedback_content": "Given the idea's classification as 'NOV-COMPETITIVE,' enhancing novelty and impact could be achieved by integrating privacy-preserving federated learning techniques from the 'Globally-Linked Concepts' list. For example, adopting federated learning to allow decentralized multi-institutional or multi-agency training of the coordination analysis models on sensitive communication logs (e.g., emergency response communications or healthcare-related messaging) would not only address the sensitive nature of such data but also boost scalability and generalizability. This approach could significantly strengthen the impact and practical adoption potential, especially in healthcare and emergency response sectors that require stringent privacy compliance when handling multi-platform communication data. Consider incorporating federated graph learning or privacy-aware retrieval augmentation modules as next research stages or experiment extensions. Target: Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan."
