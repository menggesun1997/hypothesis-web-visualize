    "title": "Explainable Hybrid Network-Language Models for Clinical Expertise",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current fine-tuned LLMs for clinical tasks suffer from poor explainability and trustworthiness, limiting their adoption in sensitive medical domains.",
    "Motivation": "Directly tackles the internal gap in explainability and the trust issues noted in Clinical LLM evaluation by creating a hybrid architecture that combines network analytical models with explicit prompt tuning strategies to generate interpretable and safe domain expertise outputs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a hybrid model where the LLM is guided by an interpretable network-based reasoning engine that encodes clinical relations (e.g., disease-drug, symptom-diagnosis graphs). The pipeline utilizes instruction prompt tuning complemented by structured graph constraints and produces rationale explanations alongside predictions.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Construct a clinical knowledge graph from curated biomedical ontologies.\n2. Develop a network reasoning engine that infers paths and relations relevant to query inputs.\n3. Implement instruction prompt tuning to embed network reasoning outputs as rationale prompts for the LLM.\n4. Test on clinical QA datasets requiring explanation of reasoning steps.\n5. Compare explanations and answer accuracy against vanilla fine-tuned LLMs.\n6. Evaluate trust and safety metrics using human expert review and adversarial testing.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Explain why medication A is recommended for symptom B in patient C.\"\nExpected Output: \"Medication A targets the receptor implicated in symptom B by blocking pathway X, supported by clinical network relations and evidence embedded in the reasoning engine.\"",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If integration leads to degraded LLM accuracy or explanation coherence, switch to a post-inference explanation generator module trained on the LLM's outputs combined with network features, employing attention visualization and logic rule extraction methods."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a promising hybrid approach combining a network reasoning engine and LLM guided by instruction prompt tuning. However, the mechanism by which the network reasoning outputs are integrated into the LLM's prompt remains underspecified. Details such as how the reasoning engine's outputs will be formatted, aligned semantically and temporally with LLM inputs, and how conflicting signals between graph constraints and LLM knowledge are reconciled need to be elaborated. Without clarifying these integration specifics, it is risky to assume that the hybrid model will maintain or improve prediction accuracy while achieving explainability goals. Greater methodological detail and a conceptual model linking the components would strengthen soundness and reproducibility of the approach. Consider explicitly defining the interfaces and feedback loops between the network reasoning and LLM components to ensure coherent combined reasoning and rationale generation. This clarity is essential to assess feasibility and practical implementation pathways effectively. This critique targets the Proposed_Method section specifically, as it is the core technical innovation."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is a useful scaffold but lacks crucial practical detail and may underestimate the complexity involved in each step. For example, constructing a clinically accurate, comprehensive knowledge graph (Step 1) from multiple biomedical ontologies is a nontrivial undertaking requiring extensive curation, alignment of heterogeneous data sources, and ontology disambiguation, which is not addressed. Similarly, developing a network reasoning engine (Step 2) that reliably extracts relevant clinical paths and explanations demands rigorous validation, which is not detailed. The plan also does not specify quantitative or qualitative metrics for measuring explanation quality or trust, nor does it describe the standards or protocols for human expert review or adversarial testing (Step 6). Furthermore, dependency or fallback triggers between steps in case of failure are not defined beyond a brief fallback plan. To increase feasibility, the experiment plan should include more granular milestones, risk mitigation strategies, validation criteria, and explicit plans for expert-in-the-loop evaluation. Without these details, the feasibility risk for this ambitious clinical application remains high."
