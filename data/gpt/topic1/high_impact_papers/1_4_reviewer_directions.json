    "title": "Multi-Relational Graph-Driven Prompt Engineering for Domain-Specific LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current prompt tuning techniques do not explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge, limiting LLMsâ€™ capability to reason over complex domain data such as biological networks.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the gap of underexploited network data in prompt tuning by developing a relational graph-driven prompt generation system that dynamically constructs instruction prompts enriched with domain network context for enhanced factual recall and reasoning.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a system that queries domain-specific relational graphs to extract relevant subgraphs for a given task and translates these into structured, natural language prompt augmentations. Integrate this with instruction prompt tuning of LLMs to inject contextual relational knowledge at inference time without full model retraining.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop graph query modules for domain knowledge graphs.\n2. Design natural language templates to verbalize graph substructures.\n3. Compose dynamic prompts combining user queries with graph-contextualized augmentations.\n4. Fine-tune LLMs on instruction prompts including such context.\n5. Evaluate on domain QA and reasoning tasks.\n6. Perform user studies for prompt interpretability and effectiveness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What pathways involve protein D relevant to disease Z?\"\nGenerated Prompt: \"Considering the interactions of protein D with proteins E and F involved in apoptosis and inflammation pathways impacting disease Z, please explain...\"\nExpected Output: A detailed explanation embedding relational context from the prompt.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If hand-crafted templates fail to capture knowledge effectively, switch to neural prompt generation conditioned on graph embeddings. Alternatively, employ retrieval-augmented generation combining explicit graph facts with prompt tuning."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a conceptually appealing approach to integrate relational graph knowledge into prompts but lacks details on how graph substructures are reliably transformed into natural language in a manner that preserves nuanced relational semantics. Clarify how the system handles ambiguity and potential information overload in the prompt, especially given LLM token limits. Also, better explain the interaction between the instruction tuning stage and the dynamic prompt augmentation at inference to ensure consistent utilization of the embedded graph context without retraining the entire model, as this interaction is central to the approach's soundness and novelty claims. Providing a conceptual or architectural diagram with detailed data flow would strengthen clarity significantly, enabling reviewers to assess the mechanism's validity more robustly without speculative assumptions about implementation specifics. This is critical to avoid hidden pitfalls that might undermine the approach's effectiveness in complex domain-specific reasoning tasks like biomedical networks where relational nuance matters greatly.

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment, the idea can gain stronger impact and distinction by integrating knowledge graph embedding techniques or biomedical relation extraction methods from the globally-linked concepts list. Specifically, consider leveraging recent advances in knowledge graph embeddings to generate continuous vector representations of the extracted subgraphs, which can be fed into a neural prompt generator rather than relying solely on hand-crafted or template-based natural language verbalizations. This would enhance scalability and generalize better across domains. Additionally, integrating techniques from biomedical relation extraction and knowledge graph question answering could enrich the system's ability to retrieve and verbalize more precise and semantically rich relational facts. Such integration will elevate the system beyond manual template approaches and position it competitively with leading retrieval-augmented LLM prompt engineering methods, thereby boosting innovation, feasibility, and applicability in high-impact biomedical NLP and AI for intelligent decision-making domains.
