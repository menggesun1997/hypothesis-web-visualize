    "title": "Ethnographically-Informed Symbolic Knowledge Injection for Bias Mitigation in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Most LLM fairness approaches lack deeper sociocultural understanding, risking superficial bias mitigation that misses embedded systemic issues. A gap exists in integrating ethnographic communication research with technical AI fairness methods in LLMs.",
    "Motivation": "Directly addresses the internal gap of the missing nexus between communication research and algorithmic fairness by pioneering an approach that injects ethnographic findings as symbolic knowledge into LLMs for fairness improvements, creating an interdisciplinary evaluative and mitigation tool.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Leverage ethnographic studies to extract symbolic knowledge rules about communication fairness and bias contexts. Encode these into rule-based knowledge graphs integrated with LLM training and inference pipelines as guidance constraints. During generation, model biases are penalized according to violations of these rules, effectively grounding fairness in sociocultural realities documented by communication research.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select representative ethnographic studies focusing on bias and communication.\n2) Manually curate symbolic fairness knowledge graphs encoding norms and anti-bias principles.\n3) Integrate these graphs via neuro-symbolic methods into LLM fine-tuning.\n4) Benchmark against state-of-the-art bias mitigation LLMs on communication datasets.\n5) Evaluate both quantitative bias metrics and qualitative sociocultural fairness assessments by expert panels.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A news report discussing gender roles.\nExpected Output: The generated text observes culturally sensitive fairness rules such as avoiding stereotypical gender assumptions and appropriately representing diverse voices, with model outputs aligned to ethnographic constraints.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If symbolic integration hamstrings fluency, switch to soft constraint regularizers or reinforcement learning with human-in-the-loop feedback derived from ethnographic experts."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes integrating symbolic knowledge graphs encoding ethnographic fairness principles as constraints in LLM training and inference. However, the underlying mechanism of how such symbolic constraints interact with large neural models lacks rigorous clarity. Specifically, the process of converting complex sociocultural norms into formal rules, their precise representation in the knowledge graph, and how their violation penalties are operationalized and balanced against language fluency and diverse contextual generations needs stronger theoretical grounding and technical detail. Clarify the neuro-symbolic integration approach—whether via soft constraints, loss functions, or reinforcement learning—and how conflict between symbolic rules and data-driven distributions will be resolved to avoid unintended degradation of model generativity or fairness metrics. This explanation is essential to establish soundness and reproducibility in this interdisciplinary approach, ensuring it is not overly simplistic or superficially symbolic without meaningful grounding in model behavior and ethnographic complexity. Provide either a conceptual formalization or a preliminary prototype plan for this integration mechanism to strengthen the soundness argument in Proposed_Method's explanation section, especially given the fallback plan's mention of alternate soft constraints or human-in-the-loop feedback systems as mitigation for integration challenges, indicating non-trivial complexity. This foundational detail is critical before advancing to implementation or experimental validation steps, lest the approach appears vague or overly ambitious without technical feasibility clarity in its core method design and innovation claim."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty screening's designation of NOV-COMPETITIVE and considering the deeply interdisciplinary but niche focus on ethnographic communication norms for bias mitigation, I recommend broadening the impact and enhancing novelty by explicitly linking the symbolic knowledge injection framework to globally impactful themes such as climate change mitigation policies or international trade communication scenarios. For instance, the model could be extended or benchmarked on bias and fairness in LLM outputs related to global negotiations on climate change or international economic discourse, domains with diverse sociocultural communication challenges. Leveraging moral intuitions and economist consensus as additional symbolic knowledge layers could refine the fairness constraints beyond ethnographic norms toward widely recognized ethical or economic fairness standards. This integration would not only boost the societal impact and relevance of the method but also position it more competitively within the AI fairness and NLP landscape by targeting high-stakes, cross-domain fairness challenges where systemic biases critically affect global decision-making and communication efficacy. Suggest concretely including these global socio-technical contexts as explicit testbeds or knowledge graph domains in future experimental design or method scope expansion to raise both impact potential and interdisciplinary novelty."
