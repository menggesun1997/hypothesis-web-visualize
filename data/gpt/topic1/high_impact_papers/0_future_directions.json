        "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Multi-Phase Thematic Synthesis Framework",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current communication and media research methodologies struggle to effectively evaluate complex multi-modal media data due to fragmented and siloed approaches, limiting methodological rigor and comprehensive synthesis.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses internal gap of limited integration of multi-phase thematic analysis from health services research into complex content analysis within communication studies, leveraging the hidden bridge identified for enhanced evaluation robustness.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a unified framework that systematically integrates multi-phase thematic analysis protocols (used in health services evaluations) with advanced content analysis techniques tailored for multi-modal media data. This involves automated phase detection, cross-modal theme alignment, and process evaluation metrics embedded within a retrieval-augmented platform to facilitate iterative interpretive cycles.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate multi-modal datasets from communication research (videos, texts, images). 2) Implement baseline content analysis and thematic coding approaches. 3) Incorporate multi-phase thematic modules based on healthcare meta-synthesis protocols. 4) Evaluate on standard metrics such as thematic cohesion, recall of latent themes, and process evaluation robustness. 5) Compare with expert-coded benchmarks to assess qualitative rigor.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A dataset of public health campaign videos and social media posts discussing vaccination. Expected Output: Identification of multi-layered themes (emotional appeals, misinformation patterns, outreach strategies) through distinct phases reflecting initial narrative framing to public reception stages, with quantified evaluation of theme evolution and coherence.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If automatic phase detection underperforms, fallback to semi-supervised phase annotation with domain experts. Alternatively, trial simplified uni-phase thematic aggregation with cross-validation on manual coding sets."

        "title": "eHealth-Informed Cross-Media Communication Effectiveness Metric Suite",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing communication effectiveness metrics inadequately capture quality-of-life impacts and care coordination analogs in complex cross-media studies, leaving outcome measures shallow and non-comparable.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the global gap highlighting underutilization of eHealth intervention evaluation frameworks in communication research, enabling novel, outcome-oriented metrics that bridge healthcare quality assessments with media impact studies.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design and validate a comprehensive metric suite inspired by eHealth care coordination and quality-of-life evaluation paradigms. This suite maps media interaction outcomes to surrogate health and wellbeing proxies, integrating subjective user feedback, engagement analytics, and thematic impact measures, implemented via a modular retrieval-augmented evaluation toolkit.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Extract principles from eHealth evaluation literature on care coordination and QoL metrics. 2) Identify analogous constructs in cross-media communication (e.g., message coherence, behavioral influence). 3) Develop mapping algorithms and software tools. 4) Apply on datasets involving health communication campaigns across multiple media types. 5) Assess correlation with independent behavioral outcome measures and user surveys.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Campaign combining TV ads, Twitter posts, and podcasts promoting mental health awareness. Output: Quantified metrics reflecting coordination effectiveness (message consistency across channels), recipient quality-of-life proxies (self-reported stigma reduction), and behavioral intent changes, demonstrating comprehensive effectiveness.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct mapping to QoL proxies fails, revert to a reduced metric set focusing on validated engagement and sentiment analysis measures. Alternatively, employ qualitative follow-up studies for metric refinement."

        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) integrating external knowledge via retrieval face challenges in systematically synthesizing voluminous multi-source data with methodological rigor from meta-analytic traditions, limiting contextualization depth.",
        "Motivation": "Responds to the gap of under-integrated computational meta-analytic methods from information sciences into social science research processes, proposing a novel fusion for enhanced LLM contextualization especially in media studies.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Engineer an end-to-end meta-analytic knowledge integration layer atop retrieval-augmented LLMs, embedding statistical synthesis algorithms, heterogeneity quantification, and process evaluation modules into the retrieval pipeline to dynamically curate and summarize evidence with meta-analytic rigor.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect diverse textual corpora used in communication research. 2) Baseline with standard RAG LLM models. 3) Incorporate meta-analytic extension modules processing retrieved documents before prompt submission. 4) Measure improvements in factual consistency, synthesis quality, and thematic coverage via expert evaluation and quantitative discrepancy measures.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Query on 'media influence on political polarization' with hundreds of research abstracts retrieved. Output: LLM synthesizes key meta-analytic effect sizes, confidence intervals, and thematic consensus rather than surface-level summaries, providing nuanced integrative context.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If statistical synthesis integration is computationally prohibitive, fallback to hierarchical clustering and weighted summarization heuristics with manual meta-analytic calibration."

        "Fallback_Plan": "Simplify temporal granularity or use cross-sectional snapshots if continuous dynamic modeling underperforms, or incorporate domain expert annotations for incremental improvements."
