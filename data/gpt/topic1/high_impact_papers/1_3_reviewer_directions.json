    "title": "Cross-Modal Relational Embedding Augmentation for Scientific LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs struggle to fully integrate structural biology knowledge with linguistic context due to modality misalignment and lack of integrated relational embeddings.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the critical gap on leveraging multi-relational graph embeddings by proposing novel cross-modal alignment techniques that transform protein network embeddings into a language-compatible latent space for fine-tuning LLMs, improving domain comprehension and reasoning.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an embedding augmentation framework that performs projection and alignment of graph-based protein interaction embeddings into the LLM embedding space via contrastive learning and modality translation layers. This aligned embedding is then used as auxiliary input during LLM fine-tuning to enhance contextual grounding in biological structure.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Obtain paired biological texts and corresponding protein interaction graphs.\n2. Train a graph encoder and language encoder jointly with cross-modal objectives to align embedding spaces.\n3. Fine-tune LLM with aligned graph embeddings concatenated or fused with input token embeddings.\n4. Evaluate on domain-specific reasoning and factuality benchmarks.\n5. Conduct visualization and interpretability analysis of aligned spaces.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Describe the effect of the protein complex formed by A, B, and C on enzymatic activity.\"\nExpected Output: \"The complex of proteins A, B, and C enhances enzymatic activity by stabilizing the active site, as supported by interaction embeddings aligned with textual evidence.\"",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cross-modal alignment degrades language model fluency, test using gating mechanisms to selectively incorporate graph embeddings or pre-train alignment modules separately before fine-tuning. Alternatively, explore adapter modules for incremental integration."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes an embedding augmentation framework involving projection, alignment via contrastive learning, and modality translation layers, but lacks clarity on the precise architecture and integration pipeline, such as how embedding fusion or concatenation interacts with the LLM during fine-tuning. Elaborate on the model design decisions, assumptions behind alignment effectiveness, and how this integration preserves LLM fluency and capacity for language reasoning to ensure soundness of approach and reduce risk of performance degradation inherent in multi-modal fusion attempts especially in large transformer models. Concrete architectural diagrams or pseudocode would strengthen this section significantly and address mechanistic ambiguities inherent in cross-modal alignment of such distinct modalities as graphs and language embeddings, facilitating reproducibility and clarity of innovation scope in this competitive area.  This detail is critical given the potential challenges stated in the fallback plan, indicating uncertainty about seamless integration at the embedding level without harming language modeling capabilities.  Please clarify or augment this section with anticipated failure modes and mitigations directly tied to the fusion mechanism design choices to increase reviewer confidence in soundness and practical viability of the approach in an already competitive niche.

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a reasonable coarse approach but omits several concrete specifics critical for feasibility and rigorous validation. For example, the sourcing and characteristics of paired biological texts and protein interaction graphs need elaboration: how will data quality, scale, and alignment fidelity be assured? The joint training regime for graph and language encoders needs details on architecture choice, loss weighting, and optimization strategies, as cross-modal alignment is known to require careful balancing. The fine-tuning step's protocol for fusion (concatenation/fusion) and evaluation benchmarks' selection criteria lack specificity and risk insufficient domain relevance or robustness. Include concrete datasets (e.g., known protein databases and textual corpora), quantifiable evaluation metrics, baseline comparisons, and ablation studies to guide reproducibility and feasibility assessment. Additionally, clarify how interpretability analysis will be performed: Are there established visualization methods for aligned embedding spaces in this context? This detailed experimental blueprint is essential for the community to assess, replicate, and build on the work in this tightly competitive domain. Without this, feasibility remains an open question.  (Target section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)  Feedback Code: [FEA-EXPERIMENT]"
