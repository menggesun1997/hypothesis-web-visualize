    "title": "Dynamic Process Evaluation for Multi-Modal Communication Research Using Health Services Methods",
    "Problem_Statement": "Media studies lack robust frameworks to dynamically evaluate iterative communication processes over time, especially when integrating multi-modal data sources, hampering understanding of evolving media impacts.",
    "Motivation": "Leverages health services process evaluation approaches as identified in the hidden bridge to create iterative evaluation models, bridging an internal gap in handling dynamic media data complexity and evaluation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a dynamic evaluation framework employing time-series process evaluation pipelines adapted from health systems, incorporating sequencing of communication events, intervention reflections, and recipient feedback loops across media forms, integrated within a retrieval-augmented analysis system.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather longitudinal multi-modal datasets (news articles, social media streams). 2) Implement baseline static content analysis. 3) Develop process evaluation modules simulating health intervention phases. 4) Quantify temporal shifts in themes, message effectiveness, and recipient sentiment. 5) Validate against known media event timelines and impact reports.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: COVID-19 related information flows through TV, Twitter, and official websites over six months. Output: Dynamic process evaluation showing phased communication adjustments, public sentiment reactions, and thematic evolution linked to pandemic milestones.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "Simplify temporal granularity or use cross-sectional snapshots if continuous dynamic modeling underperforms, or incorporate domain expert annotations for incremental improvements."
