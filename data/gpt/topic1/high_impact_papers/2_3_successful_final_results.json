        "title": "A Hybrid Mechanism for Coherent Integration of Heterogeneous Knowledge Bases in LLM Prompt Engineering with Human-in-the-Loop Validation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current fragmentation between mixed methods research and methods research limits effective integration of heterogeneous knowledge bases into large language model (LLM) prompt engineering workflows, leading to incoherent prompts and variable task performance.",
        "Motivation": "While prior works explore either qualitative or quantitative approaches in prompt engineering, a clearly operationalized hybrid framework that systematically aligns diverse expert knowledge and data-driven embeddings is lacking. Addressing the NOV-COMPETITIVE context, this proposal advances methodological clarity by detailing explicit integration mechanisms, leveraging human-computer interaction principles and tools inspired by socio-legal pluralism research to enable adaptive, iterative refinement of prompts. This approach offers a reproducible, transparent, and superior framework for harmonizing methodological pluralism in LLM prompt engineering, improving reliability, coherence, and few-shot task outcomes.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid meta-framework that tightly couples qualitative thematic analysis with quantitative embedding alignment through a formalized, stepwise integration pipeline supported by human-in-the-loop validation. First, diverse expert knowledge bases (e.g., textual expert interviews, domain-specific legal reasoning texts, and structured datasets) are subject to Computer-Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS) to extract thematic codes reflecting semantic concepts and argument structures drawn from socio-legal pluralism and linguistic landscape studies. Simultaneously, quantitative embedding vectors are derived from large pre-trained models, capturing semantic similarities in high-dimensional space. The core mechanism aligns qualitative themes with embedding clusters through algorithmic topic-embedding matching using similarity thresholding and conflict detection heuristics. In cases of conflict—e.g., divergent expert themes versus embedding proximities—the framework triggers iterative human-in-the-loop sessions involving domain experts and prompt engineers employing interactive visualization dashboards rooted in human-computer interaction best practices. These sessions reconcile discrepancies by adjusting embedding weightings, refining thematic codes, or incorporating additional semiotic resources, iteratively updating prompt structures. Methodological triangulation ensures reliability by cross-validating integrated knowledge from multiple sources, and an adaptive adjustment algorithm dynamically optimizes prompt tokens based on continuous feedback via downstream task performance metrics. This integrated process is fully documented with procedural algorithms, pseudocode, and exemplar workflows illustrating practical application in legal and applied linguistics domains.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate heterogeneous knowledge bases relevant to selected LLM prompt tasks, including transnational law expert interviews and legal doctrine texts.\n2) Utilize CAQDAS tools to conduct qualitative thematic coding, extracting salient themes grounded in socio-legal frameworks.\n3) Generate embedding vectors from LLMs for text corpora, applying clustering algorithms to detect semantic groupings.\n4) Implement an alignment algorithm that maps qualitative themes to embedding clusters using cosine similarity thresholds and a conflict flagging mechanism.\n5) Conduct human-in-the-loop iterative validation sessions leveraging interactive visualization dashboards to resolve detected conflicts and refine integrated prompt representations.\n6) Assemble hybrid prompts combining curated thematic content with weighted embeddings.\n7) Evaluate the impact on few-shot learning benchmark tasks (e.g., domain-specific legal question answering), employing control baselines such as standard prompt templates without integration.\nMetrics include:\n- Quantitative Integration Coherence Score: measured via semantic similarity consistency indices between thematic labels and embedding cluster centroids.\n- Task Performance Gains: accuracy and F1-score improvements on benchmark datasets.\n- Methodological Robustness: interrater reliability (Cohen’s kappa) during validation phases and stability of iterative updates.\nDataset selection criteria include representativeness of domain knowledge variability and presence of diverse semiotic resources.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A multi-source prompt combining legal expert interview extracts, transnational law doctrinal texts, and structured legal case metadata.\nExpected Output: Improved zero/few-shot classification accuracy on complex legal question-answering tasks, with coherent prompt narratives validated through qualitative coding consistency and embedding alignment metrics.\nFor example, embedding proximity reflects thematic coherence with negotiated expert meaning, verified by domain experts during human-in-the-loop sessions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full hybrid integration yields inconsistent or unstable prompt constructions, deploy modular subframeworks tailored for specific domains (e.g., separate pipelines for legal vs linguistic knowledge) incorporating adaptive switching based on task context detection. Alternatively, prioritize either expert-driven thematic prompts or embedding-derived prompt constructs dynamically, guided by continuous performance monitoring and uncertainty quantification metrics to select the optimal integration mode per use case."

In particular, explicit algorithms or procedural steps on aligning qualitative themes with quantitative embeddings and managing conflicts between data-driven and expert knowledge are needed to establish methodological clarity and reproducibility. Strengthen this section by providing more concrete descriptions or examples of the integration process and the iterative human-in-the-loop validation phases to ensure a sound mechanism underpinning the framework's effectiveness and coherence in LLM prompting contexts. This will help reviewers and practitioners better understand the feasibility and reproducibility of the approach, reducing ambiguity in execution and evaluation stages.
