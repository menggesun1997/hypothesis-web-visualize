        "title": "Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Memory Networks for Explainable Long-Term Reasoning",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM architectures lack explicit, scalable memory modules that integrate structured knowledge bases enabling interpretability and efficient long-term reasoning over heterogeneous data.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses internal gap of fragmented integration between data manipulation and knowledge modeling, and incorporates Opportunity 2 by leveraging lexical-semantic content for explainable memory enhancement, thus increasing interpretability and semantic coherence.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hierarchical memory network architecture where multiple levels encode and retrieve knowledge graph embeddings aligned with lexical-semantic networks. The model includes dynamic attention mechanisms that selectively query structured knowledge bases integrated with LLM latent states. A semantic control module enforces coherence by cross-validating reasoning chains against human language network principles, producing transparent inference paths.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Benchmark on datasets requiring multi-hop reasoning (e.g., HotpotQA, WikiHop). 2) Train using a composite loss incorporating reasoning accuracy and semantic coherence metrics. 3) Compare with baseline LLMs equipped with non-structured memory modules. 4) Evaluate interpretability via user studies and explainability metrics. 5) Ablate components to measure contribution of hierarchical and lexical-semantic modules.",

        "Fallback_Plan": "If hierarchical memory integration proves inefficient, explore a flattened but gated memory retrieval using graph neural networks with attention to dynamically prune knowledge components. Alternatively, incorporate post-hoc explanation models for interpretability without hierarchical memory."
