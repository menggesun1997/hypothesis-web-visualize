        "title": "Graph-Enhanced Self-Supervised Adaptive Recommender Systems for Personalized Prompt Engineering in Few-Shot LLM Contexts",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current few-shot learning frameworks with large language models lack robust mechanisms for personalized prompt adaptation that can dynamically leverage heterogeneous, complex knowledge bases and diverse user interaction histories. Moreover, practical deployment is hindered by challenges in scalable user data collection, cold start problems, real-time adaptation latency, and feedback noise management, limiting effective personalization and task success across domains.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing personalization gaps in LLM prompt engineering requires moving beyond straightforward recommenders to systems that deeply model the rich relational structure of knowledge snippets, user behaviors, and prompt templates. By integrating state-of-the-art graph representation learning and self-supervised pretraining into human-centered adaptive recommenders, we unlock superior contextual representations and enable robust, scalable adaptation in few-shot scenarios. This fundamentally advances over prior work by explicitly tackling cold start, noisy feedback, and integration latency challenges with rigorous experimental validation, promising impactful improvements in personalized AI interaction across critical legal, medical, educational, and creative domains.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel adaptive recommender system leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode heterogeneous relationships among knowledge snippets, user feedback signals, and prompt templates within a unified graph structure. This GNN-based embedding underpins dynamic prompt personalization with rich contextual awareness. To mitigate cold start and data sparsity, we employ self-supervised learning techniques to pretrain the recommender on large unlabeled user interaction datasets, enhancing generalization to new users and tasks. Our system fuses explicit user ratings with carefully weighted implicit behavioral signals (e.g., dwell time, edit patterns), applying noise-robust aggregation to handle conflicting feedback. Real-time integration with the LLM prompting pipeline is optimized via asynchronous update mechanisms and model pruning to minimize latency. Mixed-method analyses incorporate qualitative user studies and quantitative interaction logs to iteratively refine the recommendation and prompt adaptation processes. This method advances personalized prompt engineering by uniting graph-based knowledge representation, self-supervised user modeling, and rigorous human-AI co-adaptation workflows.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Establish diverse user cohorts across legal, medical, and educational domains through partnerships and simulated environments to ensure representative interaction data at scale.\n2) Collect baseline LLM prompting interaction logs including explicit feedback and implicit signals such as click patterns, response time, and prompt editing.\n3) Construct a heterogeneous graph combining knowledge snippets, user profiles, prompt templates, and feedback events.\n4) Develop and pretrain the adaptive recommender using self-supervised objectives (e.g., graph contrastive learning) on unlabeled interaction data to enhance cold start robustness.\n5) Integrate the recommender within the LLM prompt pipeline using asynchronous inference and model compression techniques, targeting sub-second adaptation latency.\n6) Implement noise-aware feedback fusion strategies balancing explicit and implicit signals, validated via ablation studies.\n7) Conduct iterative user studies with mixed qualitative and quantitative analyses to assess personalization quality, prompt adaptation speed, task success rates, and user satisfaction.\n8) Perform rigorous ablation studies isolating contributions of graph embedding, self-supervision, feedback fusion, and latency optimization.\n9) Publish reproducible benchmarks and open-source the framework for community validation and extension.\nThis stepwise plan ensures practical viability, scalability, and methodological rigor aligned with current best practices in adaptive AI and LLM engineering.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A legal practitioner preparing a contract summary begins with limited history but quickly receives dynamically refined prompt templates and domain-specific knowledge snippets personalized via the graph-augmented recommender, informed by prior implicit and explicit feedback.\nExpected Output: Accelerated prompt adaptation cycles, improved summary accuracy, and higher user satisfaction despite initial cold start. Subsequent interaction logs show increased alignment between recommended prompts and task needs.\n\nInput: A medical educator utilizing the system benefits from robust personalization even with sparse explicit feedback; implicit cues from editing patterns enhance prompt recommendations supported by pretrained graph representations.\nExpected Output: Notable improvements in task efficiency and prompt relevance, validated by mixed-method user feedback and performance metrics.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If integration latency or feedback noise exceeds acceptable thresholds, we will deploy tiered recommendation fallback strategies: (a) revert to cached generic yet domain-optimized prompt templates when latency spikes occur, (b) implement confidence-thresholded feedback filters to exclude unreliable signals, and (c) schedule offline batch retraining using cumulative user data to recalibrate the system periodically. Additionally, diversity enhancement algorithms will be applied to prevent overfitting personalized recommendations, ensuring balanced exploration-exploitation trade-offs for sustained user benefit."

It is recommended to elaborate on how data sparsity, cold start problems, and real-time adaptation will be addressed, as well as include pilot studies or simulation environments to validate feasibility before full deployment. This will strengthen the scientific soundness and practicality of the experimental approach, ensuring reliable evaluations of adaptive prompt effectiveness across tasks and user types. For example, clarifying how implicit signals will be captured and weighted versus explicit feedback, and mechanisms for handling noisy or contradictory feedback, will greatly enhance feasibility and reproducibility of results in real-world settings.  Please update the experiment plan accordingly to reflect these considerations and provide more rigorous, stepwise validation milestones for the adaptive recommender system integration with LLMs, focusing on realistic user scenarios and scalable data collection methods for robust evaluation metrics such as user satisfaction and prompt adaptation speed.

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict of 'NOV-COMPETITIVE', a valuable direction to substantially enhance innovation and impact is to explicitly integrate advanced concepts from 'representation learning' and 'graph representation learning' to better model and leverage complex, heterogeneous knowledge bases and user interaction histories within the adaptive recommender framework. For example, employing graph neural networks to encode relationships among knowledge snippets, user feedback signals, and prompt templates could foster richer contextual representations, improving the recommender’s ability to personalize prompt adaptations dynamically and effectively. Additionally, incorporating 'self-supervised learning techniques' could help pretrain the recommender system on unlabeled interaction data, boosting performance especially in cold-start scenarios. Integrating such methods aligns well with cutting-edge paradigms combining 'pre-trained language models' with structured knowledge representation and advanced user modeling, which can set this work apart in a competitive landscape. Embedding these globally linked concepts would not only augment method novelty but also potentially deepen impact across diverse scenarios where few-shot learning and personalized prompt engineering converge, such as legal, medical, or educational applications. Please consider revising the proposed method and experiment design to incorporate representative graph-based embedding and self-supervised pretraining strategies, and evaluate their contribution to recommendation quality, task success, and adaptation efficiency. This integration would provide a meaningful advance beyond straightforward recommender-LLM coupling, empowering more scalable, robust, and nuanced personalized prompt adaptations. Overall, this strategic enhancement will help the research leap beyond 'novel combination' territory toward a genuinely distinctive contribution with stronger theoretical and empirical foundations, increasing interest from the community and accelerating real-world adoption and impact. We strongly encourage elaboration on this in the next iteration of the work.
