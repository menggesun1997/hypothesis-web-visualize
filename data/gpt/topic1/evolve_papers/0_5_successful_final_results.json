    "title": "Click-Driven Conversational Coreference Resolution via Latent Semantic Retrieval",
    "Problem_Statement": "Conversational QA systems exhibit poor coreference resolution, affecting context understanding and retrieval relevance in multi-turn settings, and existing retrieval models do not utilize user interaction signals like clicks to improve this.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing critical internal gaps in coreference and pragmatic reasoning and external underuse of clickthrough data, this work proposes click-driven adaptive retrieval models that enhance coreference resolution dynamically in dialogues.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a retrieval module that integrates coreference-aware latent semantic embeddings updated via implicit user clicks indicating reference correctness or error. The system will use these signals to adapt embedding spaces emphasizing correct entity linking and pragmatic context. Jointly train retriever and generator to reinforce coreference understanding, enabling more precise retrieval of contextually appropriate documents in multi-turn dialogues.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use conversational QA datasets with annotated coreference chains (CoQA). 2. Collect or simulate clickthrough signals aligned to coreference correctness. 3. Train coreference-aware latent semantic models with click-driven supervision. 4. Evaluate on coreference resolution metrics, retrieval precision, and conversational QA accuracy. 5. Compare against baselines without click integration.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Dialogue: 'Who wrote Hamlet?' [retrieved document], next turn: 'When was he born?' with clicks confirming correct document entities. Expected Output: Generator correctly resolves 'he' to Shakespeare, outputting birth date with relevant retrieved context.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If actual click data unavailable, use simulated click signals or proxy feedback such as query reformulation patterns. Alternatively, incorporate external coreference models for pre-processing and rescoring."

        "title": "Click-Driven Conversational Coreference Resolution via Latent Semantic Retrieval with Explicit Online Adaptation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Conversational question answering (QA) systems frequently suffer from errors in coreference resolution, undermining their ability to understand multi-turn dialogue context and retrieve relevant information accurately. Existing retrieval models rarely leverage interactive user feedback signals such as clicks to dynamically improve coreference disambiguation and retrieval relevance, limiting their adaptability and performance in conversational settings.",
        "Motivation": "Despite advances in coreference resolution and conversational retrieval, there remains a critical gap in leveraging rich implicit interactive signals like user clicks, which contain valuable pragmatic information about entity disambiguation and document relevance. Current methods underexploit such digital traces, and few integrate coreference modeling tightly with adaptive retrieval systems. Our work innovates by proposing a coreference-aware, click-driven latent semantic embedding adaptation framework that dynamically updates conversational retrieval in response to user interaction. This combination—jointly training retriever and generator architectures with online, click-conditioned latent space refinement—offers a novel and competitive direction surpassing static retrieval or offline coreference approaches. It leverages state-of-the-art deep learning architectures in natural language processing and retrieval, advancing the intersection of coreference resolution and interactive information retrieval.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a unified architecture that integrates coreference-aware latent semantic embeddings within a retrieval-generator conversational QA pipeline, dynamically updated via implicit user clicks during multi-turn dialogue interactions. At its core, the system employs a dual encoder architecture: one encoder generates contextual embeddings capturing coreference chains in dialogue turns using a transformer-based NLP model enhanced with resolution algorithms, while a retriever encoder maps candidate documents into the same embedding space. User click feedback, collected at each dialogue turn, serves as a reinforcement learning (RL) signal to refine the latent semantic space. Specifically, click signals are processed through a noise-robust gating module that weighs the confidence of clicks (to handle click noise and sparsity), then incorporated into an online embedding adaptation layer using a gradient-based update with a small learning rate, ensuring low-latency updates between turns. This continuous update mechanism realigns embeddings to emphasize successfully resolved coreferences and document relevance. The retriever and the generator (a text generation model conditioned on retrieved context) are jointly optimized via multi-task training leveraging both supervised coreference annotations and click-induced RL rewards. Mechanistically, the click feedback refines the joint embedding space so that coreferential mentions in queries better match relevant entities in retrieved documents, thereby improving retrieval precision and downstream generation accuracy. Architectural diagrams include: a) Dual-encoder model with coreference embedding module. b) Click feedback integration pipeline illustrating input click signals processed through noise gating and embedding adaptation. c) Joint training flow combining supervised and RL updates on retriever and generator. Pseudocode outlines the online click-conditioned embedding update loop executed after each user interaction. We discuss failure modes such as click ambiguity and strategies like trust thresholds and fallback to external coreference models for robustness. This detailed operationalization clarifies how click signals concretely influence latent space geometry, retrieval ranking, and eventual generated answers.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset Preparation: Utilize established conversational QA datasets with annotated coreference chains such as CoQA and QuAC. 2. User Click Data Collection: Conduct controlled crowdsourcing studies and live user experiments to collect real clickthrough data aligned to dialogue turns and coreference references, ensuring a statistically significant sample size (targeting thousands of dialogues). Protocols include explicit instructions for users to click on relevant documents that disambiguate references. 3. Click Signal Validation: Analyze click reliability by correlating click patterns with annotated coreference correctness; develop metrics to quantify noise and sparsity in click data. 4. Signal Simulation: Develop a high-fidelity simulator for click signals using query reformulation patterns and proxy relevance heuristics, validating its statistical similarity to real clicks via distributional metrics and ablation studies. 5. Model Training: Train the dual-encoder retriever and generator jointly, integrating supervised coreference losses with reinforcement learning rewards derived from both real and simulated clicks. 6. Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate on coreference resolution accuracy (F1-score on coreference chains), retrieval precision (Recall@K, MRR), and overall conversational QA accuracy. 7. Baseline Comparisons: Compare to models without click integration and models using external static coreference processors. 8. Ablation Studies: Isolate the contribution of the click-driven embedding updates versus coreference modeling alone. 9. Scalability & Latency Testing: Measure embedding update latencies and impact on user interaction speed to validate online adaptation feasibility. This detailed plan addresses feasibility risks by elaborating data collection protocols and validation schemes, ensuring robust, interpretable insights into the impact of click-driven coreference-aware retrieval.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: Dialogue Turn 1: User asks 'Who wrote Hamlet?' The system retrieves documents about Shakespeare and returns the most relevant passage. User clicks confirm the document's correctness. Dialogue Turn 2: User follows up with 'When was he born?' The system uses click-updated embeddings to resolve 'he' to Shakespeare confidently, retrieving biographical data and generating an accurate answer. Expected: Higher retrieval precision for Turn 2, improved coreference metrics, and correct generation output. Example 2: Dialogue with ambiguous pronoun references where user clicks are noisy or sparse. The model employs noise gating to downweight unreliable clicks and falls back to an external coreference model for rescoring retrieval, maintaining robust performance. These cases illustrate both successful online click-driven adaptation and fallback robustness under noisy feedback.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-world user click data proves insufficient in scale or quality, we will rely on high-fidelity simulation of click signals based on user behavior heuristics such as query reformulation similarity and interaction logging from open domain datasets. We will rigorously validate these signals against limited real data to ensure fidelity. Additionally, we will integrate state-of-the-art external coreference resolution models as preprocessing modules that provide candidate entity links used for rescoring retrieval outputs. This rescoring will be evaluated in conjunction with or independently from click-driven updates, providing a modular fallback mechanism. These contingency methods will ensure method applicability despite challenges in collecting rich interactive signals, enabling stepwise progression toward full interactive adaptation."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section outlines a compelling high-level approach, but the details on how the click-driven latent semantic embeddings will be updated during user interaction remain underspecified. For example, it is unclear what model architecture will integrate click signals with coreference embeddings, how noise and ambiguity in clicks are handled, and whether clicks serve as direct supervision or as reinforcement signals within training. Clarifying the mechanism for click integration, latency considerations for online updating, and the joint training procedure for retriever and generator will substantially strengthen soundness and reproducibility of the approach. Additionally, more explicit connections between coreference resolution improvements and retrieval quality gains will improve clarity of the mechanism's causal effects. Please expand this section with architectural diagrams or pseudocode illustrating how click feedback refines the embedding space and influences retrieval and generation outputs at runtime and training time, ensuring the approach is rigorously defined and plausibly effective in practice. This will mitigate risk of oversimplification assumptions about click utility and model adaptability, enhancing internal consistency and confidence in the feasibility claims within the methodology itself (Proposed_Method). The assumption that click signals reliably and sufficiently inform coreference disambiguation is plausible but requires explicit model-level operationalization and discussion of potential failure modes (e.g., noisy or sparse clicks). This refinement is critical given the novelty and competitive nature of the area and will clarify the exact innovation and contribution within coreference-aware retrieval research. Note that as this is a novel combination of coreference and click-driven latent space adaptation, rigorous model design exposition is essential for a top-tier venue review acceptance and impact assessment.

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan thoughtfully covers dataset selection, signal simulation, training, and evaluation metrics, but the feasibility of collecting true user clickthrough signals aligned explicitly to coreference correctness is likely quite challenging. The plan relies heavily on either collecting new large-scale interactive data or simulating proxy signals (e.g., query reformulation) that may imperfectly reflect true coreference feedback. This gap introduces a key feasibility risk that should be addressed more concretely. For example, please delineate the data collection protocol (crowdsourcing, live user studies, or log mining), the scale necessary for statistical power, and the strategy to ensure that click signals actually correlate with correct/incorrect coreference decisions. Additionally, clarifying how simulation fidelity will be validated against real signals is important. The fallback plans to leverage external coreference models for rescoring are promising but require further detail on integration and evaluation conditions. Strengthening the experiment plan to explicitly incorporate risk mitigation strategies for gathering and validating click data and to robustly simulate user clicks will enhance feasibility credibility. Explicit benchmark baselines and ablation studies isolating the click-driven component from coreference modeling alone will improve interpretability and confidence in derived conclusions. This detail is crucial because the method's claimed impact hinges on effectively exploiting interactive click feedback, so demonstrating feasible pathways to obtaining and validating such feedback is imperative.
