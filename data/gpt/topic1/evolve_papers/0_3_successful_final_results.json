    "title": "Neuro-Cognitive Inspired Hybrid Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation in RAG Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Hallucination remains a persistent challenge in RAG-enhanced LLMs, partly due to suboptimal decoding strategies that insufficiently integrate external knowledge and internal memory.",
    "Motivation": "Bridging internal gaps around hallucination and external gaps in leveraging neuro-cognitive insights offers a novel hybrid decoding approach that fuses cognitive-inspired memory retrieval with probabilistic decoding, mitigating hallucinations via deep integration of knowledge and memory.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid decoding algorithm inspired by cognitive memory retrieval mechanisms combining fast pattern completion (parallel retrieval) and slow confirmation (sequential verification) processes. This decoder dynamically balances reliance on retrieved documents and internal language priors by directing attention through a neuro-inspired gating system. The approach integrates entity embeddings and semantic memory modules and introduces feedback-driven adjustments from external knowledge confidence scores during generation.",

        "title": "Neuro-Cognitive Inspired Hybrid Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation in RAG Systems",
        "Problem_Statement": "Hallucination remains a persistent challenge in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhanced large language models (LLMs), stemming from suboptimal integration of external knowledge retrieval and internal language priors during decoding. Existing solutions often fail to dynamically balance these sources, leading to fabricated or unreliable outputs.",
        "Motivation": "To overcome limitations in current RAG frameworks, this research leverages cognitive computing principles—specifically neuro-cognitive memory retrieval mechanisms inspired by an advanced analytical framework in intelligent transportation system safety—to craft a hybrid decoding approach. This approach uniquely fuses fast parallel retrieval and slow sequential verification to dynamically integrate retrieved documents with internal priors, driven by a neuro-inspired gating system. The novelty lies in formalizing and operationalizing these cognitive insights within a real-world deployable neural language model to robustly mitigate hallucinations across diverse domains and scales.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a rigorously formalized hybrid decoding algorithm grounded in cognitive computing and neural language models, blending two retrieval-verification pathways: (1) Fast Pattern Completion Module (FPCM) implementing parallel retrieval of candidate token probabilities from external knowledge embeddings using entity-centric semantic memory modules, and (2) Slow Confirmation Module (SCM) conducting sequential verification by probabilistically confirming token outputs via attention over internal language priors. A neuro-inspired gating network dynamically weighs these modules’ contributions per decoding step, based on a mathematically defined gating signal G_t = σ (W_r * C_t + W_p * L_t + W_f * F_t + b), where C_t represents confidence from retrieved knowledge, L_t internal language context, and F_t feedback-driven adjustments derived from generative adversarial network style hallucination detectors. Architectural diagrams illustrate module interplay, featuring entity embeddings feeding both modules and gating dynamics. Training employs a multi-task regime optimizing factual accuracy, hallucination reduction, and fluency with reinforcement learning from human and neural feedback, ensuring synergy and convergence. This novel integration contrasts with existing RAG methods by embedding neuro-cognitive inspired gating explicitly modeled and optimized, enhancing hallucination mitigation and fluency in real-world applications.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Benchmark implementation: Deploy a baseline RAG system with conventional beam search on large-scale, multi-domain QA datasets including NaturalQuestions, TriviaQA, and conversation-focused datasets such as Wizard of Wikipedia to ensure extensive domain diversity and scale. 2. Develop and implement the Hybrid Decoding pipeline with the Fast Pattern Completion Module, Slow Confirmation Module, and the neuro-inspired gating network, backed by entity embeddings and semantic memory modules. 3. Integrate a GAN-based hallucination detection module generating feedback signals to adaptively tune gating during generation. 4. Evaluate hallucination metrics using established quantitative measures like HaLIE and FEVER score along with BLEU and ROUGE for fluency across datasets. 5. Profile latency and convergence during iterative training to identify and optimize computational efficiency, ensuring real-time applicability is feasible. 6. Conduct statistically rigorous, double-blind user studies with n>100 participants from diverse backgrounds assessing perceived answer reliability and factual accuracy, employing standardized questionnaires and inter-rater agreement analysis for robustness. 7. Perform detailed ablation studies on gating mechanism components, memory module variants, and feedback sources. 8. Document comprehensive experimental pipeline to include performance profiling ensuring risk mitigation ahead of deployment.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What were the historic achievements of Marie Curie?\" Expected Output: A detailed, factually grounded answer correctly citing established achievements such as her pioneering research on radioactivity and two Nobel Prizes with no fabricated or unsupported claims. A comparative analysis with baseline RAG output demonstrating notable reduction in hallucination and improved answer reliability and fluency. Additional test queries will cover cross-domain topics from technology, transport systems (e.g., impacts of intelligent transportation systems on roadway safety), and modern scientific advancements illustrating model generalization.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should the hybrid decoding system cause prohibitive latency or encounter convergence obstacles, fallback strategies include deploying a modular post-generation hallucination detection pipeline using the GAN-based verification filters supplemented by probabilistic ensemble decoding to approximate the benefits of integrated gating. Parallel efforts will explore distillation of the hybrid method into lightweight, deployable modules informed by performance profiling data. This ensures practical deployment readiness alongside ongoing research."

For instance, the mechanisms for dynamically balancing retrieved document reliance against internal language priors via the neuro-inspired gating system require clearer formalization. Detailed description of the gating architecture, training regime, and interaction dynamics between entity embeddings, semantic memory modules, and feedback adjustments are needed to establish a solid soundness foundation and to convince reviewers of the method’s viability and innovation distinctness from existing RAG frameworks using memory and confidence integrations. Consider providing pseudocode or architectural diagrams to clarify these components' interactions and dependencies within the decoder, and a mathematical formulation of the gating signals based on cognitive principles would greatly enhance mechanistic transparency and credibility in the Proposed_Method section."

There is no specific mention of dataset diversity or scale, which is crucial for demonstrating robustness and generalization of hallucination mitigation beyond niche or small-scale QA datasets. Additionally, the plan briefly refers to user studies but lacks detail on methodology, sample size, or criteria for assessing perceived reliability, which are essential to validate impact practically. Moreover, potential latency and convergence issues are raised only in the Fallback_Plan without an upfront risk mitigation strategy in the experiment design. To strengthen feasibility, the plan should incorporate clearer evaluation metrics for hallucination quantification and fluency, multi-domain benchmarks, statistically rigorous user study design, and performance profiling during development iterations to measure algorithmic efficiency and real-time applicability. These enhancements will ensure the experimental assessment comprehensively validates both effectiveness and practicality of the hybrid decoding approach."
