    "Motivation": "Directly addresses the critical external gap of bridging domain expert interactions, real-time feedback, and trust calibration to improve reliability in practical settings.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a continuous deployment system where domain experts interact with LLM outputs, providing trust ratings and corrections. Use these signals to update Bayesian trust calibration models and fine-tune embeddings incrementally without full retraining, enabling ephemeral prompt adjustments. Incorporate causal inference to model the effect of feedback on user trust and prediction accuracy dynamically.",

        "title": "Multi-Modal Adaptive Trust Feedback Loop for Robust Continuous LLM Calibration in High-Stakes Domains",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current large-scale LLM deployment systems lack robust, multi-modal mechanisms that aggregate real-time domain expert feedback with telemetry and behavioral data to dynamically calibrate trust and refine model performance without destabilizing incremental updates in high-stakes environments.",
        "Motivation": "While existing approaches address trust calibration in LLM deployment, they largely rely on single-source expert feedback and offline recalibration methods, limiting adaptability and robustness. Our proposal fundamentally advances the state-of-the-art by integrating multi-source trust signals—including domain experts, system telemetry, and user interactions—combined with causal inference and deep reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively optimize trust calibration and model fine-tuning. This dynamically adaptive, multi-modal framework enables safer, more reliable LLM deployment in critical domains such as legal review, healthcare, and autonomous systems, positioning our work as uniquely scalable and impactful beyond current competitive methods.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose to develop a continuous, multi-modal trust feedback system that aggregates real-time domain expert trust ratings and corrections with auxiliary signals from system telemetry and user behavior through advanced information fusion techniques. Trust calibration models will utilize Bayesian inference enhanced by causal modeling to disentangle confounders and measure the impact of feedback longitudinally. Incremental model updates will be guided by a deep reinforcement learning agent that optimizes prompt adjustments and embedding fine-tuning policies to maximize both predictive accuracy and end-user trust without destabilizing the LLM. The system will incorporate sim-to-real transfer strategies to leverage simulated pilot data for safe pre-deployment policy learning. Feedback collection interfaces will be standardized with quantifiable trust metrics, including Likert scales, confidence intervals, and correction saliency scores. We will implement strict criteria and regularization mechanisms to detect model drift, triggering fallback batch retraining when cumulative feedback crosses predefined thresholds. This multi-layered approach integrates concepts from clinical decision support and intelligent decision-making to ensure the approach’s generality and robustness across dynamic, high-stakes environments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Conduct pilot simulation studies in a representative high-stakes domain (e.g., legal document review), generating synthetic expert trust feedback, telemetry, and behavioral data to pre-train reinforcement learning policies and validate causal models. 2) Develop standardized expert feedback interfaces incorporating trust quantification scales and correction annotation protocols to ensure consistent data collection. 3) Deploy a prototype LLM system with initial fine-tuning and integrate multi-source trust signal fusion modules and Bayesian causal inference pipelines. 4) Collect real-time multi-modal feedback from domain experts and system telemetry over extended longitudinal use, applying incremental embedding fine-tuning guided by RL policies. 5) Monitor trust calibration metrics, prediction accuracy, and user satisfaction continuously; implement regular drift detection tests with explicit thresholds for triggering fallback batch retraining with regularization. 6) Extend evaluation to additional domains like clinical decision support systems or autonomous robot navigation to demonstrate generalizability and scalability of the approach.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A paralegal submits a complex legal query to the LLM and receives an answer with an associated confidence score. The expert provides a quantified trust rating on a Likert scale and marks specific answer segments with suggested corrections and correction saliency scores. System telemetry captures response time and error rates, while behavioral data logs user hesitation and query reformulation attempts. Expected output: The system fuses these multi-modal signals to update Bayesian trust calibration parameters and incrementally fine-tunes embeddings per RL policy recommendations, resulting in improved calibrated confidence scores and more accurate subsequent outputs under similar queries, with stable model behavior over time.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If incremental updates risk destabilizing the model or cause drift, we will apply carefully designed regularization and constraint techniques within the RL policy to restrict update magnitude and direction. Additionally, we will implement strict monitoring protocols with threshold-based triggers for batch retraining using accumulated feedback and data to restore calibrated model states. Simulated environments will be used continuously to test policies and fallback strategies prior to live deployment to minimize risk in sensitive high-stakes domains."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is conceptually sound but lacks details on critical aspects that can significantly affect practical feasibility. Specifically, it omits how domain experts’ trust ratings and corrections will be standardized or quantified to update the Bayesian calibration models and embeddings incrementally without destabilizing the LLM. There is also no clear methodology described for causal inference modeling of feedback impacts, which is non-trivial and may require longitudinal data and careful confounder control. It would strengthen the feasibility if the authors elaborate on mechanisms for expert feedback collection interfaces, data volume requirements, timing and frequency of incremental updates, and criteria for triggering fallback batch retraining to prevent model drift. Adding pilot studies or simulations addressing these points before full deployment would enhance confidence in scientific rigor and operational viability of the experiment plan. This would considerably reduce execution risk in a high-stakes domain like legal review where errors are costly and expert time limited, thus ensuring the deployment pipeline is robust and actionable in practice, not just theoretically appealing.\" , \"target_section\":\"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\""

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the focus on trust calibration in domain-specific LLM deployment, the work's impact and uniqueness could be substantially enhanced by integrating concepts from related fields like clinical decision support systems or intelligent decision-making, which also rely heavily on expert feedback and trust calibration in high-stakes environments. For example, incorporating multi-source information fusion techniques to aggregate trust signals not only from direct domain expert feedback but also from system telemetry, user behavioral data, or auxiliary NLP modules could increase robustness and broaden applicability. Additionally, coupling the trust feedback loop with reinforcement learning algorithms to adaptively optimize system responses in dynamic environments can open avenues for real-time policy improvements and sim-to-real transfer strategies. Embedding such globally-linked concepts would differentiate this research by enabling richer, multi-modal, and dynamically adaptive trust calibration mechanisms, moving beyond single-domain continuous calibration. This direction may also help scale the approach towards other high-stakes domains such as healthcare or mobile robot navigation, thereby increasing community and industrial impact.\" , \"target_section\":\"Overall Proposal\"}]}  ?>}  Code Snippet End.
