    "title": "Interface-Aware Memory Modules for Enhanced LLM Robustness in Protein Reasoning",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs struggle with brittleness and lack interpretability when extrapolating protein folding predictions to unseen sequences or domains, partly due to poor incorporation of protein interaction and interface data into memory.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses brittleness and interpretability gap by designing memory components within LLMs that explicitly model protein domain interactions and interface features, improving robustness for novel biological inputs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Engineer specialized memory slots within the LLM architecture that encode protein domain-domain interaction graphs and interface residue features. These slots influence downstream reasoning via attention biases and modular embeddings, making memory reasoning interpretable and robust when faced with novel protein architecture questions.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate datasets of protein interaction networks and domain interface annotations. 2. Integrate interface-aware memory slots into an LLM framework. 3. Train with multitask objectives including interaction prediction and folding inference. 4. Evaluate on OOD protein sequences and domain recombination tasks. 5. Analyze interpretability using attribution methods.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Protein sequence with an uncommon domain combination; Task: Predict structural compatibility and interaction potential. Output: LLM outputs interaction confidence scores with interpretable memory activation patterns corresponding to known interface features, outperforming baseline LLMs in cross-domain generalization.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If interface memory slots degrade baseline performance, try soft integration via auxiliary losses or graph neural networks to encode protein interactions externally, feeding latent embeddings into the memory module."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes engineering specialized memory slots encoding protein domain interactions and interface features that influence reasoning via attention biases and modular embeddings. However, the mechanism lacks precise clarification on how these memory slots are architected within standard LLMs, how they interact with existing transformer layers, and how they avoid catastrophic interference with conventional language modeling capabilities. The plan should elucidate the integration strategy and how interpretability will concretely arise from these memory activations to establish soundness of the approach rather than relying on intuitive claims alone. This clarification is essential to validate the core technical contribution and feasibility of the proposal's novelty claim in this competitive area, ensuring the idea is more than a high-level sketch and has a reproducible design blueprint and rationale for robustness improvements in protein reasoning tasks. Detailed architectural diagrams or pseudo-code would strengthen this section considerably and boost reviewer confidence in the method’s soundness and clarity of mechanism implementation and scientific rigor in interpretability attribution methods, complementing the planned experiments. Targeted revisions are strongly recommended before further consideration of this work’s impact and viability prospects in a premier venue context."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE status and the domain-specific focus on protein interface reasoning, the proposal would likely benefit from expanding its impact and appeal by integrating concepts from broader AI and knowledge discovery domains. Specifically, leveraging advances in AI agents as interactive reasoning entities could enhance the interpretability and robustness claims by framing the protein interface-aware memory module as part of an agent that dynamically queries and updates external biological knowledge bases. Additionally, adopting data mining and knowledge discovery techniques to extract latent interaction patterns from protein-domain databases could guide memory encoding or serve as auxiliary supervision signals. Incorporation of these cross-disciplinary elements will strengthen the novelty and global scientific relevance beyond narrowly scoped domain tasks and align well with interests of venues focused on domain-specific applications and real-world deployment of LLMs for biomedical discovery. This integration would also resonate with Pacific-Asia Conference and similar forums emphasizing AI advancement for impactful knowledge discovery, offering a more compelling narrative toward advancing artificial intelligence capabilities in life sciences."
