        "Proposed_Method": "Design a novel neuro-evolutionary memory architecture where memory modules are evolved populations of latent representations, continuously optimized with evolutionary algorithms over streaming protein knowledge base updates. The system uses adaptive selectors to retrieve and update memory cells grounded in protein structure predictions, maintaining persistent yet flexible long-term reasoning capability within LLMs.",
