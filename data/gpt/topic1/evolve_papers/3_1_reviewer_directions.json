    "title": "Legally Informed Explainable AI for Individual-Level Fair Clinical Decisions",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing explainability methods often fail to provide actionable, legally grounded transparency for individual-level clinical decisions, hindering trust and compliance with anti-discrimination mandates.",
    "Motivation": "This tackles the critical gap that current XAI methods do not embed legal and healthcare practice standards into explanations, limiting user trust and accountability. It directly advances the second high-potential innovation opportunity, integrating legal ontologies into explanation generation for fairness.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We introduce LEGAL-XAI, an explainability framework embedding ontologies encoding anti-discrimination laws and healthcare standards into explanation generation pipelines for LLM-based clinical AI assistants. LEGAL-XAI produces explanations that map model decisions to legal fairness criteria and healthcare guidelines, dynamically generating counterfactuals reflecting legal compliance scenarios. This enables clinicians to understand model rationale with explicit legal context, offering actionable recourse.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect clinical decision datasets with known bias cases. 2) Develop linked ontologies for antidiscrimination laws and relevant healthcare standards. 3) Train LLMs specialized on clinical language with domain-adaptive pretraining. 4) Implement explanation modules producing legal-contextualized rationales and counterfactuals. 5) Evaluate on user trust metrics, explanation fidelity, and legal adherence using clinician user studies and legal audits. 6) Benchmark versus traditional explanation methods without legal integration.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Model predicts lower likelihood of receiving certain treatments for Black patients. LEGAL-XAI outputs an explanation highlighting how this violates the 'Equal Treatment' clause under relevant anti-discrimination law and suggests counterfactual changes removing race-associated proxies leading to fairer treatment allocation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If legal-contextual explanations prove too complex for clinician usability, develop layered explanation interfaces that provide both simple and advanced legal information progressively, coupled with targeted clinician training and interface redesign."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section presents LEGAL-XAI as embedding legal and healthcare ontologies into explanation pipelines for clinical AI. However, key technical details on how these ontologies are integrated with LLM outputs remain underspecified. For example, it is unclear how ontology terms map to model features or decisions, and how counterfactuals are generated within the legal context without design choices leading to combinatorial complexity or error propagation. Providing a clearer algorithmic description or architectural framework is critical for evaluating the soundness of the approach and reproducibility, including how dynamically generated legal explanations maintain fidelity to the underlying clinical model decisions while ensuring legal accuracy and compliance verification frameworks. Please clarify this mechanism depth-wise to solidify the soundness of the method's core contribution and reduce ambiguity about practical implementation steps and assumptions in legal reasoning automation within XAI pipelines. This will strengthen reviewer confidence in the idea's conceptual robustness and path to realization, especially given the known challenges in legal ontology-driven AI explanations in high-stakes domains like healthcare. The current description risks appearing high-level and conceptual without actionable technical grounding, which is essential for top-tier venues with rigorous standards on method transparency and soundness evaluation. Such clarifications would also inform feasibility and scope discussions downstream effectively."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Experiment_Plan lays out a sequential approach culminating in user studies and legal audits for evaluation. Yet, the plan lacks specific details on dataset accessibility, annotation protocols for bias characterization, and ontology construction methodologies, which are nontrivial in the clinical and legal interoperability context. Additionally, training specialized LLMs on clinical language with domain-adaptive pretraining requires substantial compute resources and access to sensitive, compliant datasets—a nontrivial barrier. The plan should elaborate on how privacy, data sharing constraints, and legal expertise integration will be managed practically. Also, the step of legal audits needs explicit design—what legal experts will assess, by what criteria, and how results will be quantified or mapped back to technical explanations. Without these specifics, feasibility risks being overly optimistic, particularly for timely, rigorous evaluation. Incorporating contingency plans about data governance and collaborative frameworks with legal and clinical practitioners upfront would improve project viability assessments. Further, quantifying expected resource requirements and outlining recruitment and experimental protocols for clinician user studies will strengthen the feasibility narrative. Clarify and strengthen these points to convince reviewers and stakeholders that LEGAL-XAI can proceed from concept to rigorously evaluated prototype within realistic operational constraints."
