    "title": "Clickthrough-Guided Latent Semantic Model Adaptation for Domain-Robust RAG",
    "Problem_Statement": "RAG systems lack robust domain adaptation and operational reliability since they do not sufficiently leverage real-world interaction signals like clickthrough data for dynamic relevance feedback and continual learning.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the external gap of integrating clickthrough data with latent semantic retrieval, this research blends crowd interaction signals and user feedback into RAG training loops for enhanced domain adaptation and system robustness, going beyond static latent semantic models.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a feedback-augmented RAG framework where live user interaction signals—clickthroughs, dwell time, explicit feedback—are used to dynamically update latent semantic embeddings in the retriever via online learning. The retriever and generator jointly adapt to emerging domains, with crowdsourcing pipelines enabling correction of errors. This method will introduce a hybrid offline-online training paradigm, exploiting continuous relevance refinement and user expectation modeling. Novel clickthrough-aware loss functions will modulate retrieval ranking during training.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Gather datasets with associated click logs (e.g., MS MARCO with clickthrough data). 2. Develop latent semantic retriever fine-tuned on click-guided relevance judgments. 3. Implement online learning modules to update retriever embeddings with live simulated user interactions. 4. Fine-tune generator jointly with retriever adaptively updating for domain shifts. 5. Measure domain adaptation success on specialized datasets (healthcare, finance) with user feedback simulations. 6. Evaluate improvements in retrieval precision, generation factuality, and user satisfaction proxies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User queries medical information, clicks on retrieved documents about 'diabetes symptoms'. The system updates embedding weights to better prioritize similar health-related documents for future queries. Expected Output: Subsequent responses better grounded in verified medical knowledge, with reduced hallucinations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If online learning proves unstable, introduce mini-batch update regimes with validation checkpoints. Alternatively, simulate batch re-training with synthetic clickthrough expansion. Employ active learning with human-in-the-loop validation as a safety net."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experimental plan, while broadly outlined, lacks important operational details critical for ensuring feasibility and reproducibility. For example, the plan should explicitly specify how \"live simulated user interactions\" will be realistically generated or sourced to reflect genuine clickthrough dynamics across domains. Furthermore, the approach to jointly fine-tuning the retriever and generator needs clearer articulation on synchronization frequency, stability monitoring, and computational budget. Detailing the evaluation metrics for \"user satisfaction proxies\" and defining baseline comparisons when adapting to specialized domains (e.g., healthcare, finance) would also strengthen practical study execution. Without these specifics, implementing the method risks instability or inconclusive outcomes. I recommend the authors revise the experiment plan to provide concrete methodology, anticipated challenges, and mitigation strategies around online learning, incremental updates, and domain adaptation measurement to improve scientific rigor and feasibility assessment in a competitive space like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This clarification is critical for peer reviewers and implementers alike to assess and trust the experimental workload and approach efficacy. Targeting this clear gap will materially increase the work's impact and likelihood of success in premier venues, given the complexity of dynamic relevance feedback integration in RAG systems today.  \n\nPlease revise the \"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\" section accordingly with these points in mind.  \n\n"

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the presented research focusing on clickthrough-guided latent semantic adaptation in RAG, I strongly suggest integrating graph-based approaches and knowledge representation learning, as noted in the linked concepts. Specifically, the model could benefit from incorporating an explicit graph-structured knowledge representation (e.g., entity or concept graphs) to contextualize and propagate clickthrough feedback beyond simple latent vector updates. This could make user interaction signals more robust, interpretable, and domain-aware, enhancing cross-domain knowledge discovery and retrieval precision, particularly in low-resource or specialized language domains. Additionally, aligning ranking functions with learning-to-rank algorithms that leverage these structured embeddings may further strengthen performance and relevance ranking during domain shifts. Emphasizing such hybrid dense vector plus graph-based retrieval architectures within the offline-online training paradigm may substantially lift impact and novelty in light of strong existing baselines. Please explicitly consider and outline this potential global integration in the \"Proposed_Method\" or as an extension recommendation to significantly deepen cross-disciplinary innovation and confer distinguishing advantage in the competitive landscape of RAG-related research."
