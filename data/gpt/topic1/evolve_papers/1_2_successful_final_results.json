    "Problem_Statement": "Existing approaches insufficiently leverage multimodal data (text, images, graphs) from e-commerce and supply chains, limiting the richness of domain-specific LLM fine-tuning.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap of underexplored multimodal and cross-domain knowledge fusion for LLM fine-tuning, particularly the overlooked intersections in e-commerce and supply chain data.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multimodal embedding framework that fuses textual product descriptions, user behavior analytics, supply chain graphs, and product images into unified knowledge representations. Integrate these into LLM prompt-tuning pipelines via modality-aware adapters. Employ contrastive learning between modalities to reinforce semantic alignment and enable richer domain understanding for tasks like demand forecasting and product classification.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble multimodal datasets from e-commerce platforms comprising text, images, and graph-structured supply chain info. 2) Construct baseline mono-modal LLM fine-tuned models. 3) Develop modality encoders and fusion mechanisms within adapters. 4) Perform contrastive pretraining to align modalities. 5) Fine-tune for downstream classification and forecasting tasks. 6) Evaluate accuracy, F1, and modality contribution ablations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Product listing with description, image, and supply chain node info. Expected output: Accurate classification of product category and prediction of stock shortage risk, supported by multimodal evidence.",

        "title": "Multimodal Knowledge Fusion with Semantic-Interoperable Adapters for Domain-Specific LLMs in E-Commerce and Supply Chain",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current domain-specific large language model (LLM) fine-tuning approaches inadequately integrate the heterogeneous and multimodal data sources intrinsic to e-commerce and supply chains—such as textual product descriptions, images, user behavior sequences, and complex supply chain graphs—resulting in limited comprehension and predictive performance on industry-critical tasks.",
        "Motivation": "While multimodal fusion in LLMs is an active research area, the convergence of advanced graph representation learning for supply chain structures, temporal sequence modeling of user behaviors, and vision-language integration within a unified, semantic-interoperable adapter framework remains underexplored. Addressing this gap can enable richer and more robust domain embeddings, facilitating superior accuracy and explainability in e-commerce and supply chain forecasting and classification tasks. Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating, our motivation is to advance beyond existing methods by designing modality-specific encoders and fusion workflows that tightly couple with LLM prompt-tuning pipelines, leveraging state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNNs), ResNet-50 based vision encoder tuning, gated recurrent units (GRUs) for behavioral sequences, and semantic interoperability techniques to align learned representations.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an architecture composed of distinct modality encoders: a ResNet-50 based visual encoder fine-tuned jointly with LLM adapters to process product images; a transformer-based text encoder for product descriptions; gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks to model temporal patterns in user behavior analytics; and specialized graph neural networks (e.g., GraphSAGE or GAT) to embed supply chain graph structures. Each encoder outputs modality-specific embeddings standardized into a shared semantic feature space via semantic interoperability frameworks, such as ontology alignment and cross-modal contrastive learning objectives. Fusion occurs at the adapter layer in the LLM prompt-tuning pipeline through semantic-interoperable adapters—modality-aware modules that incorporate gating mechanisms to weigh and integrate embeddings dynamically. Contrastive learning is orchestrated across these adapters and modality encoders by maximizing agreement between paired modalities while respecting their heterogeneity, mitigating discrepancies in scale and structure. This architecture enables end-to-end fine-tuning that jointly optimizes modality encoders and adapters, ensuring robust alignment and synergistic knowledge fusion across heterogeneous data sources.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate a large-scale multimodal dataset aligned with e-commerce and supply chain contexts, encompassing product descriptions, images, temporal user behavior logs, and graph-structured supply chain metadata. 2) Establish baselines with mono-modal LLM fine-tuned models per modality. 3) Implement modality-specific encoders: fine-tune ResNet-50 for images jointly with adapters; design GRU networks for user behavior sequence embeddings; develop GNN modules for supply chain graphs; integrate a shared text encoder. 4) Design semantic interoperability modules to map these embeddings into a unified feature space, using ontology-driven alignment techniques. 5) Construct semantic-interoperable adapters with gating units for dynamic fusion at the adapter layer of the LLM prompt-tuning pipeline. 6) Perform joint contrastive pretraining to enhance cross-modal representation alignment and semantic coherence. 7) Fine-tune the full system for downstream classification (product categories) and forecasting (stock shortage risk) tasks. 8) Evaluate via accuracy, F1 score, modality ablation studies, and interpretability analyses demonstrating modality contributions and temporal/graph relational insights.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An e-commerce product record with textual description, a product image, sequential user interaction logs (clicks, purchases), and supply chain graph nodes detailing supplier relationships and logistics paths. Expected Output: 1) Accurate classification of product category demonstrating multimodal enrichment, 2) Reliable prediction of imminent stock shortage risk informed by supply chain graph embeddings and temporal user demand patterns, 3) Explanation of decisions highlighting contribution weights assigned by semantic-interoperable adapters to each modality embedding.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If joint multimodal fusion underperforms, we will explore sequential or cascaded modality integration, starting with the strongest modalities (e.g., textual and graph) and progressively adding others. We will experiment with adapter architecture variants that incorporate modality-specific normalization or residual connections to stabilize training. Additionally, we will employ generative AI techniques to create synthetic multimodal samples for data augmentation and leverage transfer learning from related domains to enhance encoder robustness and representation quality."
