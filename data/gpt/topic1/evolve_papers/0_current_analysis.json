Nevertheless, LLMs are prone to hallucination, generating plausible yet nonfactual content. This phenomenon raises significant concerns over the reliability of LLMs in real-world information retrieval (IR) systems and has attracted intensive research to detect and mitigate such hallucinations. Given the open-ended general-purpose attributes inherent to LLMs, LLM hallucinations present distinct challenges that diverge from prior task-specific models. This divergence highlights the urgency for a nuanced understanding and comprehensive overview of recent advances in LLM hallucinations. In this survey, we begin with an innovative taxonomy of hallucination in the era of LLM and then delve into the factors contributing to hallucinations. Subsequently, we present a thorough overview of hallucination detection methods and benchmarks. Our discussion then transfers to representative methodologies for mitigating LLM hallucinations. Additionally, we delve into the current limitations faced by retrieval-augmented LLMs in combating hallucinations, offering insights for developing more robust IR systems. Finally, we highlight the promising research directions on LLM hallucinations, including hallucination in large vision-language models and understanding of knowledge boundaries in LLM hallucinations.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'The Power of Noise: Redefining Retrieval for RAG Systems', 'abstract': \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a method to extend beyond the pre-trained knowledge of Large Language Models by augmenting the original prompt with relevant passages or documents retrieved by an Information Retrieval (IR) system. RAG has become increasingly important for Generative AI solutions, especially in enterprise settings or in any domain in which knowledge is constantly refreshed and cannot be memorized in the LLM. We argue here that the retrieval component of RAG systems, be it dense or sparse, deserves increased attention from the research community, and accordingly, we conduct the first comprehensive and systematic examination of the retrieval strategy of RAG systems. We focus, in particular, on the type of passages IR systems within a RAG solution should retrieve. Our analysis considers multiple factors, such as the relevance of the passages included in the prompt context, their position, and their number. One counter-intuitive finding of this work is that the retriever's highest-scoring documents that are not directly relevant to the query (e.g., do not contain the answer) negatively impact the effectiveness of the LLM. Even more surprising, we discovered that adding random documents in the prompt improves the LLM accuracy by up to 35%. These results highlight the need to investigate the appropriate strategies when integrating retrieval with LLMs, thereby laying the groundwork for future research in this area.\"}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Natural Questions: A Benchmark for Question Answering Research', 'abstract': 'We present the Natural Questions corpus, a question answering data set. Questions consist of real anonymized, aggregated queries issued to the Google search engine. An annotator is presented with a question along with a Wikipedia page from the top 5 search results, and annotates a long answer (typically a paragraph) and a short answer (one or more entities) if present on the page, or marks null if no long/short answer is present. The public release consists of 307,373 training examples with single annotations; 7,830 examples with 5-way annotations for development data; and a further 7,842 examples with 5-way annotated sequestered as test data. We present experiments validating quality of the data. We also describe analysis of 25-way annotations on 302 examples, giving insights into human variability on the annotation task. We introduce robust metrics for the purposes of evaluating question answering systems; demonstrate high human upper bounds on these metrics; and establish baseline results using competitive methods drawn from related literature.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'BLEU: a method for automatic evaluation of machine translation', 'abstract': 'Human evaluations of machine translation are extensive but expensive. Human evaluations can take months to finish and involve human labor that can not be reused. We propose a method of automatic machine translation evaluation that is quick, inexpensive, and language-independent, that correlates highly with human evaluation, and that has little marginal cost per run. We present this method as an automated understudy to skilled human judges which substitutes for them when there is need for quick or frequent evaluations.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'CoQA: A Conversational Question Answering Challenge', 'abstract': 'Humans gather information through conversations involving a series of interconnected questions and answers. For machines to assist in information gathering, it is therefore essential to enable them to answer conversational questions. We introduce CoQA, a novel dataset for building Conversational Question Answering systems. Our dataset contains 127k questions with answers, obtained from 8k conversations about text passages from seven diverse domains. The questions are conversational, and the answers are free-form text with their corresponding evidence highlighted in the passage. We analyze CoQA in depth and show that conversational questions have challenging phenomena not present in existing reading comprehension datasets (e.g., coreference and pragmatic reasoning). We evaluate strong dialogue and reading comprehension models on CoQA. The best system obtains an F1 score of 65.4%, which is 23.4 points behind human performance (88.8%), indicating that there is ample room for improvement. We present CoQA as a challenge to the community at https://stanfordnlp.github.io/coqa .'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'ColBERT', 'abstract': \"Recent progress in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is driving fast-paced advances in Information Retrieval (IR), largely owed to fine-tuning deep language models (LMs) for document ranking. While remarkably effective, the ranking models based on these LMs increase computational cost by orders of magnitude over prior approaches, particularly as they must feed each query-document pair through a massive neural network to compute a single relevance score. To tackle this, we present ColBERT, a novel ranking model that adapts deep LMs (in particular, BERT) for efficient retrieval. ColBERT introduces a late interaction architecture that independently encodes the query and the document using BERT and then employs a cheap yet powerful interaction step that models their fine-grained similarity. By delaying and yet retaining this fine-granular interaction, ColBERT can leverage the expressiveness of deep LMs while simultaneously gaining the ability to pre-compute document representations offline, considerably speeding up query processing. Crucially, ColBERT's pruning-friendly interaction mechanism enables leveraging vector-similarity indexes for end-to-end retrieval directly from millions of documents. We extensively evaluate ColBERT using two recent passage search datasets. Results show that ColBERT's effectiveness is competitive with existing BERT-based models (and outperforms every non-BERT baseline), while executing two orders-of-magnitude faster and requiring up to four orders-of-magnitude fewer FLOPs per query.\"}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Learning deep structured semantic models for web search using clickthrough data', 'abstract': 'Latent semantic models, such as LSA, intend to map a query to its relevant documents at the semantic level where keyword-based matching often fails. In this study we strive to develop a series of new latent semantic models with a deep structure that project queries and documents into a common low-dimensional space where the relevance of a document given a query is readily computed as the distance between them. The proposed deep structured semantic models are discriminatively trained by maximizing the conditional likelihood of the clicked documents given a query using the clickthrough data. To make our models applicable to large-scale Web search applications, we also use a technique called word hashing, which is shown to effectively scale up our semantic models to handle large vocabularies which are common in such tasks. The new models are evaluated on a Web document ranking task using a real-world data set. Results show that our best model significantly outperforms other latent semantic models, which were considered state-of-the-art in the performance prior to the work presented in this paper.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'A Deep Relevance Matching Model for Ad-hoc Retrieval', 'abstract': 'In recent years, deep neural networks have led to exciting breakthroughs in speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, there have been few positive results of deep models on ad-hoc retrieval tasks. This is partially due to the fact that many important characteristics of the ad-hoc retrieval task have not been well addressed in deep models yet. Typically, the ad-hoc retrieval task is formalized as a matching problem between two pieces of text in existing work using deep models, and treated equivalent to many NLP tasks such as paraphrase identification, question answering and automatic conversation. However, we argue that the ad-hoc retrieval task is mainly about relevance matching while most NLP matching tasks concern semantic matching, and there are some fundamental differences between these two matching tasks. Successful relevance matching requires proper handling of the exact matching signals, query term importance, and diverse matching requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel deep relevance matching model (DRMM) for ad-hoc retrieval. Specifically, our model employs a joint deep architecture at the query term level for relevance matching. By using matching histogram mapping, a feed forward matching network, and a term gating network, we can effectively deal with the three relevance matching factors mentioned above. Experimental results on two representative benchmark collections show that our model can significantly outperform some well-known retrieval models as well as state-of-the-art deep matching models.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Seven Failure Points When Engineering a Retrieval Augmented Generation System', 'abstract': 'Software engineers are increasingly adding semantic search capabilities to applications using a strategy known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). A RAG system involves finding documents that semantically match a query and then passing the documents to a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT to extract the right answer using an LLM. RAG systems aim to: a) reduce the problem of hallucinated responses from LLMs, b) link sources/references to generated responses, and c) remove the need for annotating documents with meta-data. However, RAG systems suffer from limitations inherent to information retrieval systems and from reliance on LLMs. In this paper, we present an experience report on the failure points of RAG systems from three case studies from separate domains: research, education, and biomedical. We share the lessons learned and present 7 failure points to consider when designing a RAG system. The two key takeaways arising from our work are: 1) validation of a RAG system is only feasible during operation, and 2) the robustness of a RAG system evolves rather than designed in at the start. We conclude with a list of potential research directions on RAG systems for the software engineering community.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Improving the Domain Adaptation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Models for Open Domain Question Answering', 'abstract': 'Abstract\\n                  Retrieval Augment Generation (RAG) is a recent advancement in Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA). RAG has only been trained and explored with a Wikipedia-based external knowledge base and is not optimized for use in other specialized domains such as healthcare and news. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of joint training of the retriever and generator components of RAG for the task of domain adaptation in ODQA. We propose RAG-end2end, an extension to RAG that can adapt to a domain-specific knowledge base by updating all components of the external knowledge base during training. In addition, we introduce an auxiliary training signal to inject more domain-specific knowledge. This auxiliary signal forces RAG-end2end to reconstruct a given sentence by accessing the relevant information from the external knowledge base. Our novel contribution is that, unlike RAG, RAG-end2end does joint training of the retriever and generator for the end QA task and domain adaptation. We evaluate our approach with datasets from three domains: COVID-19, News, and Conversations, and achieve significant performance improvements compared to the original RAG model. Our work has been open-sourced through the HuggingFace Transformers library, attesting to our work’s credibility and technical consistency.'}]\n```\n\n**Part A.2: The Evolution Links (Edges of the Graph):**\nThe following list defines the citation relationships between the papers in Part A.

    "title": "Landscape Map: Knowledge Base Integration via Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Enhanced LLM Contextualization",
    "current_research_landscape": "The current research landscape centers on improving the contextualization of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This approach emerged as a response to the inherent limitations of LLMs' closed-world knowledge and their tendency to hallucinate non-factual content. Core methodologies involve the coupling of advanced retrieval techniques — such as deep latent semantic models (e.g., ColBERT) and relevance matching architectures — with generative LLMs to augment prompt inputs with relevant, contextual documents. The focus has evolved from benchmarking QA datasets and evaluation metrics (e.g., Natural Questions, CoQA, BLEU) to examining the retrieval component's influence on generation quality, uncovering surprising effects such as improvements from introducing random documents. Additionally, domain adaptation and end-to-end joint training of retriever and generator components have been recognized as crucial for deploying RAG in specialized contexts like healthcare and news. The central conceptual clusters revolve around conversational question answering, latent semantic retrieval models, random document effects, and robust evaluation metrics, reflecting a multidisciplinary integration of deep language understanding, semantic matching, and IR techniques to combat hallucinations and enhance factual grounding in LLM-generated outputs.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internally, significant limitations persist regarding the validation, robustness, and operational reliability of RAG systems, as highlighted by identified failure points across diverse domains. Even state-of-the-art retrieval models struggle with aligning retrieved information with generation tasks, and existing approaches often treat retriever and generator components separately, resulting in suboptimal domain adaptation and susceptibility to irrelevant or noisy data influence. Furthermore, conversational and multi-turn question answering datasets reveal challenges such as coreference resolution and pragmatic reasoning that are insufficiently addressed. Critically, the surprising finding that non-relevant or random documents can improve LLM accuracy exposes a limited understanding of the interplay between retrieval noise and generative models, pointing to a conceptual gap in retrieval prompt design and context modeling. Externally, the global co-occurrence analysis reveals an underexplored opportunity to integrate aggregate query handling with conversational questioning and to leverage clickthrough data for adaptive learning, which remains disconnected from current latent semantic retrieval paradigms within RAG systems. Cross-disciplinary advances in neuro-cognitive modeling of memory and dialogue systems, as well as innovations in hybrid decoding strategies and external knowledge representation (e.g., using entity embeddings and dense retrievers), have not been fully exploited to mitigate hallucination or improve end-to-end retrieval-generation synergy.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "1. Developing Adaptive Retrieval-Guided LLM Architectures for Conversational and Aggregate Queries: Leveraging the global insight connecting 'aggregate queries' and 'conversational questions', this direction would explore dynamically contextual retrieval and generation that integrate memory-augmented dialogue understanding. It addresses the internal gap in managing conversational dependencies and pragmatic reasoning by combining conversational QA datasets with adaptive retrieval models informed by user interaction history (e.g., clickthrough data). \n\n2. Investigating the Role and Mechanism of Retrieval Noise in Enhancing LLM Generation Robustness: Inspired by the counter-intuitive finding on random documents improving accuracy, research should delve into the theoretical and empirical foundations of retrieval noise infusion. This includes designing noise-aware retrieval prompts and fine-tuning joint retriever-generator training to exploit beneficial noise patterns, addressing the gap in understanding retrieval prompt structure and context disambiguation.\n\n3. Cross-disciplinary Integration of Clickthrough Data and Latent Semantic Models for Dynamic, Domain-Adaptive RAG Systems: Bridging 'clickthrough data' with 'latent semantic models' and leveraging crowdsourcing and user feedback mechanisms to improve relevance judgments and domain adaptation. This opportunity aims to create RAG systems that continuously learn from real-world interaction signals, enhancing robustness and validating responses during operation, thus tackling the critical system validation and reliability challenges noted internally."
