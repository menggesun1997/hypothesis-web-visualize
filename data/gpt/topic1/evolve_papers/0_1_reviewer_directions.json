    "title": "Retrieval Noise Injection for Robust LLM Generation via Noise-Aware Prompt Engineering",
    "Problem_Statement": "Non-relevant or random documents were unexpectedly found to improve LLM generation accuracy, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood, limiting the ability to purposefully exploit retrieval noise.",
    "Motivation": "This targets the critical external conceptual gap regarding the role of retrieval noise in improving generation robustness. By systematizing noise-aware retrieval prompt design and joint training, this research builds a theoretical and practical foundation to harness beneficial noise patterns.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a noise injection framework for RAG where controlled stochastic perturbations to retrieval inputs (random, semi-random, context-shifted documents) are combined with specialized noise-aware prompting strategies for the generator. Implement a joint training regime where the retriever learns to balance true relevance and structured noise, while the generator is trained to leverage contextual diversity induced by noise to improve factuality and reduce hallucinations. Visualization and interpretability tools will analyze how noise affects attention and generation pathways.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use standard QA datasets (Natural Questions, TriviaQA) as baseline. 2. Implement noise injection strategies: purely random retrieval, context-drifted vs. semantically related noise. 3. Train noise-aware prompts for GPT-based generations under varying noise conditions. 4. Perform controlled experiments comparing end-to-end joint training with independent retriever/generator training. 5. Evaluate with metrics for accuracy, hallucination rates, and factual consistency. 6. Conduct ablation on noise levels and document types.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Question: 'Who is the CEO of Tesla?' Retrieval set injected with a mixture of relevant Tesla news articles plus random unrelated sport articles. Expected Output: Despite noise, the generator reliably outputs 'Elon Musk' due to learned robustness and noise-informed prompt design.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If noise injection disrupts generation quality, revert to soft noise schedules with gradual introduction, or incorporate denoising modules. Alternatively, explore hybrid deterministic and stochastic retrieval fusion with generator ensembles to enhance robustness."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that non-relevant or random documents improve LLM generation accuracy requires clearer empirical grounding and theoretical justification. The proposal should better articulate why and under what circumstances noise benefits robustness instead of degrading quality, to solidify the hypothesis before building extensive methods upon it. Incorporating preliminary analyses or citing prior controlled studies of beneficial noise effects in retrieval-augmented generation would strengthen soundness substantially. Without this, the foundation risks being speculative, making the proposed mechanisms harder to validate and interpret reliably at scale, especially since noise typically degrades performance in most retrieval-based tasks. Consider explicitly specifying assumptions about what kinds of noise correlate with improvement and why the joint training can capitalize on these patterns effectively, including potential failure modes and boundary conditions for this assumption's validity. This will make the approach more convincing scientifically and guide subsequent experimental design more precisely, enhancing interpretability and reproducibility of findings for the community.

For instance, employing contrastive loss functions to learn a discriminative boundary between helpful structured noise and harmful noise could enhance retriever noise calibration effectively. Additionally, exploring hybrid retrieval approaches from video-language models or biomedical time series analytics might inspire sophisticated, multi-modal noise patterns that further improve robustness in specialized domains. Leveraging insights from intelligent decision-making or Critical Infrastructure Protection could motivate socially impactful applications where robustness to noisy retrieval is mission-critical. These integrations will differentiate the work beyond incremental combinations and tap into broader research trends, increasing its visibility and adoption potential at premier venues.
