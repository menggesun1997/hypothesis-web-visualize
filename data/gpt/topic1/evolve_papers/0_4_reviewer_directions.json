    "title": "Dynamic Aggregation of Multi-Modal Knowledge for Contextualized RAG in Specialized Domains",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current RAG systems primarily focus on textual knowledge and often ignore multi-modal sources (images, tables, graphs), limiting contextualization in domains like healthcare or scientific literature where knowledge is multi-modal.",
    "Motivation": "This idea exploits the external gap of cross-disciplinary advances by integrating heterogeneous knowledge representations and retrieval across multiple modalities, enhancing LLM contextualization well beyond traditional semantic text retrieval.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a unified multi-modal retrieval-augmentation framework where textual, visual, and structured knowledge embeddings co-exist in a shared latent space. Develop cross-modal retriever architectures capable of multimodal query reformulation, and design generator conditioning mechanisms that fuse multi-modal retrieved information seamlessly. Specialized domain adapters will enable dynamic weighting and attention over modalities based on conversational context and query type.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multi-modal datasets combining text, images, and tables (e.g., medical reports with scans, scientific papers with figures). 2. Train multi-modal retrievers jointly with adapters for domain specialization. 3. Extend LLM input conditioning layers for heterogeneous modalities. 4. Benchmark on specialized multimodal QA datasets and measure improvements in accuracy, relevance, and hallucination reduction. 5. Analyze modality contribution per query type.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Query about 'interpretation of chest X-ray abnormalities in COVID-19'. Expected Output: Generator produces a contextualized, accurate explanation referencing both textual guidelines and visual scan retrievals fused in the response.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-modal integration proves too complex or data-starved, focus on dual-modality (text plus tables) first and progressively incorporate images. Alternatively, rely on modality-specific retrieval cascades with late fusion in generation."

          "feedback_content": "While the idea of creating a unified multi-modal retrieval-augmentation framework is compelling, the proposal lacks detailed clarity on how the cross-modal retriever architectures will effectively perform multimodal query reformulation and how the generator conditioning layers will fuse heterogeneous modalities at the model architecture level. Further, mechanisms for dynamic weighting and attention based on conversational context are mentioned but not well-specified, leaving some uncertainty about implementation feasibility and soundness of the core method. Providing architectural diagrams or algorithmic outlines would significantly strengthen the soundness and clarity of the proposed method section to reassure reviewers that the approach is sufficiently concrete and well-grounded technically. Consider detailing how embeddings from different modalities will be aligned, how late fusion versus joint embedding strategies will be balanced, and how domain adapters will be integrated into the overall pipeline explicitly to improve soundness and replicability of this novel integration approach (Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty is marked as 'NOV-COMPETITIVE', it would be beneficial to enhance the idea's impact and distinctiveness by integrating concepts from 'process mining' and 'knowledge management'. Specifically, incorporating process mining techniques to dynamically model and adapt to user interaction workflows or domain-specific information retrieval patterns could tailor the multi-modal retrieval aggregator more effectively, improving contextualization over time. Additionally, leveraging knowledge management approaches to structure and curate heterogeneous knowledge from different modalities might improve retrieval precision and reduce hallucination. Exploring synergy with AI agents that orchestrate retrieval modalities dynamically based on query characteristics and user context could further elevate the practical impact and novelty of the system. This global integration could help differentiate the system from existing multi-modal RAG approaches and open new avenues for adaptive, real-time, domain-specialized knowledge augmentation (Globally-Linked Concepts)."
