    "title": "Neuro-Cognitive Inspired Hybrid Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation in RAG Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Hallucination remains a persistent challenge in RAG-enhanced LLMs, partly due to suboptimal decoding strategies that insufficiently integrate external knowledge and internal memory.",
    "Motivation": "Bridging internal gaps around hallucination and external gaps in leveraging neuro-cognitive insights offers a novel hybrid decoding approach that fuses cognitive-inspired memory retrieval with probabilistic decoding, mitigating hallucinations via deep integration of knowledge and memory.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid decoding algorithm inspired by cognitive memory retrieval mechanisms combining fast pattern completion (parallel retrieval) and slow confirmation (sequential verification) processes. This decoder dynamically balances reliance on retrieved documents and internal language priors by directing attention through a neuro-inspired gating system. The approach integrates entity embeddings and semantic memory modules and introduces feedback-driven adjustments from external knowledge confidence scores during generation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Implement baseline RAG with standard beam search on QA benchmarks. 2. Develop the hybrid decoder incorporating cognitive gating and memory modeling modules. 3. Integrate entity embeddings and knowledge confidence metrics. 4. Evaluate hallucination prevalence, factual accuracy, and fluency across multiple datasets including conversational QA. 5. Run user studies to assess perceived answer reliability. 6. Perform ablation on gating mechanisms and memory module implementations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Question about 'historic achievements of Marie Curie'. Expected Output: Answers accurately grounded on retrieved documents without fabricating achievements, showing improved hallucination mitigation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If hybrid decoding complexity causes latency or convergence issues, fallback to modular post-generation hallucination detection with fact verification filters. Alternatively, employ probabilistic ensembles to mimic hybrid decoding benefits."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed hybrid decoding algorithm is inspired by neuro-cognitive memory retrieval mechanisms combining fast parallel retrieval and slow sequential verification, the proposal lacks sufficient clarity on how these processes will be concretely implemented in the decoding pipeline. For instance, the mechanisms for dynamically balancing retrieved document reliance against internal language priors via the neuro-inspired gating system require clearer formalization. Detailed description of the gating architecture, training regime, and interaction dynamics between entity embeddings, semantic memory modules, and feedback adjustments are needed to establish a solid soundness foundation and to convince reviewers of the methodâ€™s viability and innovation distinctness from existing RAG frameworks using memory and confidence integrations. Consider providing pseudocode or architectural diagrams to clarify these components' interactions and dependencies within the decoder, and a mathematical formulation of the gating signals based on cognitive principles would greatly enhance mechanistic transparency and credibility in the Proposed_Method section."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan covers important evaluation stages but omits critical aspects regarding scientific feasibility and thoroughness. There is no specific mention of dataset diversity or scale, which is crucial for demonstrating robustness and generalization of hallucination mitigation beyond niche or small-scale QA datasets. Additionally, the plan briefly refers to user studies but lacks detail on methodology, sample size, or criteria for assessing perceived reliability, which are essential to validate impact practically. Moreover, potential latency and convergence issues are raised only in the Fallback_Plan without an upfront risk mitigation strategy in the experiment design. To strengthen feasibility, the plan should incorporate clearer evaluation metrics for hallucination quantification and fluency, multi-domain benchmarks, statistically rigorous user study design, and performance profiling during development iterations to measure algorithmic efficiency and real-time applicability. These enhancements will ensure the experimental assessment comprehensively validates both effectiveness and practicality of the hybrid decoding approach."
