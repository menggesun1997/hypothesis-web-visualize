        "title": "Trust-Calibrated Human-in-the-Loop Adaptive Fine-Tuning for Domain-Specific LLMs with Integrated Decision-Theoretic Optimization and Multi-Modal Expert Feedback",
        "Problem_Statement": "Contemporary domain-specific LLM fine-tuning approaches lack a rigorously defined dynamic trust calibration mechanism that tightly integrates interpretability and adaptive decision support. This leads to diminished user trust and suboptimal outcomes in critical high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance, where decision reliability and explanations of causal inference impacts are essential. Additionally, current methods rarely unify heterogeneous expert signals or optimize recommendations under uncertainty, limiting practical utility for real-world intelligent decision-making.",
        "Motivation": "While existing frameworks combine Bayesian calibration, uncertainty-aware prompt tuning, and explainable representations, they often treat these components in isolation without clear joint operational mechanisms or decision-theoretic integration. This proposal seeks to bridge that gap by systematically detailing and formalizing the interaction among model components using mathematical formulations and algorithmic steps. By incorporating multi-modal expert feedback streams inspired by multi-sensor fusion and embedding a decision-theoretic optimization module, this approach enhances trust calibration beyond probabilistic estimates to actionable, risk-aware recommendations. This fusion addresses the novelty gap by evolving from calibration alone toward an intelligent adaptive system for explainable, optimized domain-specific NLP applications, advancing both methodology and practical impact.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an interactive adaptive framework that tightly integrates human-in-the-loop fine-tuning of domain-specific LLMs with decision-theoretic modeling and multi-modal expert feedback assimilation:\n\n1) **Model Architecture & Feedback Integration:** The base LLM is augmented with a Bayesian calibration layer and uncertainty-aware prompt tuning modules. Knowledge embeddings and prompt parameters are jointly updated via a mathematically defined algorithm where expert corrections are encoded as feedback vectors influencing posterior parameter distributions. Expert signals can derive from multiple heterogeneous modalities (e.g., textual annotations, visual diagnostic imagery, sensor data), employing multi-sensor fusion methods (e.g., attention-based fusion) to produce context-aware trusted confidence adjustments.\n\n2) **Algorithmic Procedure:** At each iteration, the LLM produces outputs with calibrated confidence and explainable intermediate representations quantified via attribution metrics (e.g., integrated gradients, causal inference scores). Experts review outputs and provide corrective feedback which is represented as vectorized corrections on confidence scores and explanation components. These corrections update Bayesian calibration parameters and prompt tuning weights through a joint optimization objective combining likelihood maximization and trust calibration losses. We formalize the update steps as an expectation-maximization style algorithm ensuring convergence criteria are met and computational efficiency is maintained.\n\n3) **Interpretability Metrics Integration:** Interpretability is quantitatively measured by fidelity scores to causal clinical features or finance indicators and incorporated as a regularization term in the feedback update loop to align explanations with domain expert judgments, thereby enhancing trust and transparency.\n\n4) **Decision-Theoretic Optimization Module:** We embed a downstream decision-making layer that leverages calibrated outputs and uncertainty estimates to generate risk-aware recommendations optimizing a domain-specific utility function (e.g., minimizing expected readmission risk cost or financial loss). This module adapts with fine-tuning to align model outputs with optimal decision policies under uncertainty.\n\nOverall, this framework is a novel hybrid system that evolves domain-specific LLM fine-tuning from static calibration to an adaptive, interpretable, multi-modal, and decision-optimized process, setting new standards for high-stakes AI trustworthiness.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect richly annotated domain-specific datasets from healthcare and finance including multi-modal expert signals (textual annotations, diagnostic images, sensor data). 2) Implement a baseline fine-tuning pipeline with Bayesian calibration and uncertainty-aware prompting. 3) Develop a multi-modal human-in-the-loop interface to capture heterogeneous expert feedback with attribution alignment. 4) Formalize and implement the joint update algorithm integrating expert corrections into Bayesian calibration and prompt tuning with interpretability regularization. 5) Design and integrate a decision-theoretic optimization layer producing risk-aware actionable recommendations. 6) Evaluate via trust calibration metrics (Expected Calibration Error, Brier score), interpretability fidelity scores (e.g., causal feature attribution accuracy), task accuracy, convergence behavior, computational efficiency, and user trust surveys in simulated and live expert studies. 7) Compare against state-of-the-art static calibration and non-optimized fine-tuning baselines. 8) Conduct ablation studies to isolate contributions of multi-modal fusion and decision-theoretic components.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical note with patient history and associated ECG imaging asks \"What is the likelihood of patient readmission within 30 days?\"\nExpected output: Model predicts a calibrated risk score with confidence intervals, highlights causal clinical features and ECG indicators supporting the prediction via explainable intermediate attribution maps, and offers a risk-aware admission/release recommendation. Expert feedback on confidence calibration, explanation accuracy, and any multi-modal input integration errors is collected in real-time and mathematically incorporated into joint model updates that refine embeddings, prompt parameters, and decision thresholds iteratively.\n\nInput: Financial report with textual analysis and market sensor data asks \"What is the risk level of portfolio insolvency next quarter?\"\nExpected output: Model outputs calibrated risk with probabilistic bounds, visualizes key contributing financial indicators influencing the risk through attribution, and suggests portfolio rebalancing strategies maximizing expected utility under uncertainty. Multi-expert feedback on explanations and recommendations is fused and used to update the model embeddings and decision policies.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If Bayesian calibration convergence issues arise, fallback to ensemble neural calibration approaches combined with conformal prediction to maintain trust bounds. If multi-modal expert feedback is limited or noisy, simulate feedback streams using active learning and domain-knowledge-based synthetic corrections prioritizing uncertain cases, ensuring robustness. Alternatively, simplify the system by decoupling the decision-theoretic optimization module to a post-processing reinterpretation while retaining core calibration and interpretability updates, preserving foundational trust improvements."

For example, the mechanism for jointly updating knowledge embeddings and prompt parameters with real-time expert corrections is not clearly articulated, nor is the computational or convergence behavior described. To strengthen soundness, explicitly detail the stepwise algorithmic procedures, how expert feedback is incorporated mathematically, and how calibration adjustments are propagated through the model. Clarify how interpretability is quantitatively measured and integrated into the feedback loop to justify trust calibration claims rigorously. This will solidify the methodological foundation and make validation more reproducible and convincing to reviewers and practitioners alike, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare or finance where trust is crucial and explanations must be reliable and understandable at a fine granularity (e.g., causal links in clinical features)."

For instance, augment the human-in-the-loop adaptive fine-tuning framework with decision-theoretic modeling that not only calibrates trust but also optimizes recommendations for risk-aware decision support. You might incorporate multi-sensor fusion principles to assimilate heterogeneous expert feedback streams or multi-modal domain signals, thereby enriching contextual grounding and robustness of trust estimates. This integration can elevate the impact by positioning the approach not just as a calibration mechanism but as a broader intelligent system enabling adaptive, explainable, and optimized decision-making under uncertainty, amplifying appeal to both NLP and interdisciplinary ML research communities."
