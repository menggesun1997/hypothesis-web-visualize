    "title": "Multi-Modal BLEU-Guided Neural Prompt Translation and Synthesis for Biomedical Text Generation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Biomedical report generation and natural language synthesis fail to effectively leverage multi-modal data and BLEU-based evaluation feedback for optimizing quality and clinical accuracy.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the external gap (a) about insufficient linkage between BLEU scores, multi-modal data, and retrieval in biomedical generation tasks, this idea innovates by introducing BLEU-guided neural prompt translation and synthesis exploiting multi-modal cues for prompt design improvements.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a neural architecture that translates and synthesizes prompts by backpropagating BLEU-based evaluation signals through a multi-modal encoder-decoder pipeline conditioned on images, text, and signals. Retrieval modules augment prompt contexts with relevant evidence, closing the loop between evaluation metrics and prompt refinement in a differentiable manner.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect paired biomedical data: text reports, imaging (X-rays), signals (ECG). 2. Implement multi-modal encoder to extract embeddings. 3. Train a decoder generating prompt texts, guided by BLEU scores from generated biomedical summaries. 4. Baselines: static prompts; prompt tuning without BLEU loop; single modality prompts. 5. Metrics: BLEU, clinical correctness (domain expert annotation), fluency, diversity of generated reports.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Chest X-ray image and clinical metadata for a patient. System generates a prompt refined to yield a clinical summary with a BLEU score increase (e.g., from 0.55 to 0.70) against reference reports, demonstrating enhanced text fidelity.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If BLEU backpropagation is noisy, smooth metric approximation techniques or surrogate metrics (ROUGE, METEOR) will be used. If multi-modal fusion causes instability, separate modality pathways may be experimented with before late fusion."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method to backpropagate BLEU-based evaluation signals through a multi-modal encoder-decoder for prompt translation and synthesis is conceptually attractive but underspecified in critical details. Specifically, BLEU as a discrete, non-differentiable metric creates substantial challenges for gradient-based optimization. The approach should clarify how BLEU scores are converted into differentiable signals, for example, by employing differentiable surrogates or reinforcement learning techniques. Furthermore, the integration mechanism among modalities (images, text, signals) for prompt generation needs clearer exposition on how features are fused and how retrieval modules dynamically augment prompts in a trainable manner. These clarifications are essential to substantiate the soundness and novelty of the core mechanism and to anticipate technical pitfalls prior to experimentation, ensuring the approach is implementable and theoretically justified in a highly competitive area. This is critical since existing vision-language and multi-modal biomedical generation pipelines have complex fusion and training strategies well studied in the literature, implying the need for deeper technical grounding here to contribute meaningfully beyond incremental combination of existing components.\n\nRecommendation: Provide precise mathematical formulation of BLEU differentiation or its proxy, architectural diagrams detailing multi-modal fusion and retrieval augmentation, and a concise stepwise description of prompt generation conditioned on multi-modal inputs to strengthen the proposed method's soundness and reproducibility at this stage.\n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and the scope of overlapping research in multi-modal biomedical text generation and BLEU-based evaluation, a promising direction to enhance both impact and novelty is to incorporate joint latent space alignment with pre-trained vision-language models specialized for medical domains, for example, leveraging vision-language pre-training and knowledge graphs to better ground prompt translation on clinical semantics. This could also facilitate zero-shot generalization to new biomedical tasks or modalities beyond chest X-rays and ECG signals. Furthermore, integrating electronic health record (EHR) data as additional contextual inputs and aligning multi-modal embeddings with knowledge graph embeddings might substantially improve clinical correctness and interpretability. These extensions align with globally linked concepts such as 'joint latent space,' 'multi-modal representation learning,' 'knowledge graph,' and 'vision-language pre-training,' providing a crisp, competitive enhancement path that builds on the current design while increasing scientific novelty and downstream impact. This would also enable leveraging state-of-the-art baselines and benchmark datasets, moving beyond BLEU score optimization to more clinically actionable metrics and applications.\n\nTarget section: Proposed_Method"
