    "title": "Multimodal Knowledge Fusion for Domain-Specific LLMs in E-commerce and Supply Chain",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing approaches insufficiently leverage multimodal data (text, images, graphs) from e-commerce and supply chains, limiting the richness of domain-specific LLM fine-tuning.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap of underexplored multimodal and cross-domain knowledge fusion for LLM fine-tuning, particularly the overlooked intersections in e-commerce and supply chain data.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multimodal embedding framework that fuses textual product descriptions, user behavior analytics, supply chain graphs, and product images into unified knowledge representations. Integrate these into LLM prompt-tuning pipelines via modality-aware adapters. Employ contrastive learning between modalities to reinforce semantic alignment and enable richer domain understanding for tasks like demand forecasting and product classification.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble multimodal datasets from e-commerce platforms comprising text, images, and graph-structured supply chain info. 2) Construct baseline mono-modal LLM fine-tuned models. 3) Develop modality encoders and fusion mechanisms within adapters. 4) Perform contrastive pretraining to align modalities. 5) Fine-tune for downstream classification and forecasting tasks. 6) Evaluate accuracy, F1, and modality contribution ablations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Product listing with description, image, and supply chain node info. Expected output: Accurate classification of product category and prediction of stock shortage risk, supported by multimodal evidence.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If fusion models underperform, try sequential modality incorporation or prioritize stronger modality encoders. Use data augmentation or synthetic multimodal examples to enrich training."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a multimodal embedding framework and integration via modality-aware adapters, but it lacks sufficient detail on how exactly these adapters manage heterogeneous modalities in the LLM prompt-tuning pipeline. Clarify the architecture and interaction between modality encoders, fusion mechanisms, and adapters, including whether fusion occurs at embedding, adapter, or output layers, and how contrastive learning is orchestrated across these components. This will strengthen the soundness by assuring that the fusion is both conceptually and technically feasible within LLM fine-tuning constraints.\n\nTarget specific challenges such as handling discrepancies in data scale and structure between text, images, and graphs, and provide preliminary ideas on adapter designs or mechanisms to address these. Examples or prototypes would meaningfully enhance confidence in the method's mechanism and innovation distinctiveness within this competitive space.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty screen rating of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the presence of globally-linked concepts like 'graph representation learning', 'contrastive learning', and 'semantic interoperability', the proposal could significantly boost impact and novelty by explicitly incorporating advanced graph neural networks (GNNs) specialized for supply chain graph embeddings and leveraging semantic interoperability frameworks to align multimodal representations.\n\nFurthermore, linking the approach to ongoing developments in generative AI for synthetic multimodal data augmentation or employing ResNet-50-based vision encoders fine-tuned jointly with LLM adapters could enhance representation quality and robustness. Integrating recurrent units or gated mechanisms to capture sequential dependencies in user behavior analytics would also strengthen temporal modeling.\n\nThese integrations would not only address multimodal alignment but also broaden the impact scope by connecting the method to cutting-edge representation learning techniques, potentially advancing both AI and e-commerce supply chain domains.\n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
