    "title": "Trust-Calibrated Human-in-the-Loop Adaptive Fine-Tuning for Domain-Specific LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current domain-specific LLM fine-tuning lacks dynamic trust calibration and interpretability, leading to user mistrust in high-stakes domains and suboptimal decision support.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient calibration and interpretability limiting trust, and leverages the high-potential opportunity of human expert-in-the-loop feedback combined with probabilistic calibration.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an interactive fine-tuning framework where domain experts provide real-time feedback on LLM outputs via an interface. Integrate Bayesian calibration layers to adjust LLM confidence scores based on cumulative expert corrections. Use uncertainty-aware prompt tuning coupled with explainable intermediate representations to improve interpretability. This dynamic feedback loop refines both knowledge embeddings and prompt parameters, achieving calibrated and trustworthy outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect domain-specific datasets from healthcare or finance with expert annotations. 2) Implement baseline LLM fine-tuning and confidence calibration methods. 3) Develop a human-in-the-loop interface for expert feedback collection. 4) Train the Bayesian calibration layer combined with uncertainty-aware prompt tuning. 5) Evaluate trust calibration metrics (ECE, Brier score), task accuracy, and user trust surveys. 6) Compare against fixed fine-tuning baselines without feedback.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical note asks \"What is the likelihood of patient readmission within 30 days?\" Expected output: Model predicts risk with calibrated confidence intervals and highlights the reasoning steps supported by clinical features. Expert feedback adjusts confidence and explanation iteratively for improvement.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If Bayesian calibration underperforms, explore ensemble neural calibration methods or conformal prediction-based trust bounds. If expert feedback is sparse, simulate feedback with curated corrections or leverage active learning to prioritize uncertain cases."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed method integrates Bayesian calibration, uncertainty-aware prompt tuning, and explainable intermediate representations in a dynamic feedback loop, the proposal lacks clarity on how these components interact concretely in training and inference pipelines. For example, the mechanism for jointly updating knowledge embeddings and prompt parameters with real-time expert corrections is not clearly articulated, nor is the computational or convergence behavior described. To strengthen soundness, explicitly detail the stepwise algorithmic procedures, how expert feedback is incorporated mathematically, and how calibration adjustments are propagated through the model. Clarify how interpretability is quantitatively measured and integrated into the feedback loop to justify trust calibration claims rigorously. This will solidify the methodological foundation and make validation more reproducible and convincing to reviewers and practitioners alike, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare or finance where trust is crucial and explanations must be reliable and understandable at a fine granularity (e.g., causal links in clinical features)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty is rated as only competitive due to strong existing links among core components, consider integrating insights or techniques from the 'intelligent decision-making' area among the globally linked concepts. For instance, augment the human-in-the-loop adaptive fine-tuning framework with decision-theoretic modeling that not only calibrates trust but also optimizes recommendations for risk-aware decision support. You might incorporate multi-sensor fusion principles to assimilate heterogeneous expert feedback streams or multi-modal domain signals, thereby enriching contextual grounding and robustness of trust estimates. This integration can elevate the impact by positioning the approach not just as a calibration mechanism but as a broader intelligent system enabling adaptive, explainable, and optimized decision-making under uncertainty, amplifying appeal to both NLP and interdisciplinary ML research communities."
