    "title": "Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Domain Adaptation in RAG Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Deploying RAG with domain adaptation often requires sensitive user data (click logs, queries), raising privacy concerns and hindering broad adoption in domains like healthcare and finance.",
    "Motivation": "This idea tackles critical external gaps involving user data and domain adaptation by proposing a federated learning framework enabling multi-institutional collaborative RAG adaptation without data leakage, thus preserving privacy while leveraging real-world feedback.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a federated RAG training pipeline where individual client nodes fine-tune their retriever-generator locally using internal data and interaction signals. Federated aggregation securely blends gradients or model updates centrally without accessing raw data. Incorporate differential privacy mechanisms and communication-efficient protocols. The aggregated model will support domain-adaptive, privacy-compliant retrieval enhancements for downstream generation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Simulate federated environments with multiple healthcare or finance clients, each with proprietary data and click logs. 2. Implement federated training algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx) on retriever-generator modules. 3. Measure privacy metrics, communication overhead, and domain adaptation gains. 4. Benchmark model performance against centrally trained baselines. 5. Conduct privacy attack simulations to verify compliance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Institution A queries patient records; Institution B queries financial documents. Federated updates improve each local RAG model's adaptation without sharing raw queries or clicks. Expected Output: Enhanced retrieval relevance and generation accuracy respecting privacy constraints.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated convergence is slow or unstable, introduce personalization layers and hybrid centralized-federated schemes. Alternatively, deploy synthetic data augmentation offline."

        "title": "Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Domain Adaptation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems with Enhanced Mechanisms",
        "Problem_Statement": "Deploying Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that effectively adapt to specific domains requires leveraging sensitive user interaction data (e.g., query logs, click feedback). Centralized data collection in sensitive fields like healthcare and finance raises significant privacy concerns, obstructing real-world adoption and limiting domain adaptation capabilities.",
        "Motivation": "While federated learning for domain adaptation has been explored, existing approaches lack detailed, rigorous mechanisms tailored to RAG's complex retriever-generator architecture and the stringent privacy demands of sensitive domains. This proposal pioneers an end-to-end federated adaptation framework that integrates advanced differential privacy, communication-efficient protocols, and robust client heterogeneity management specifically for RAG systems. By explicitly addressing privacy-utility tradeoffs and incorporating federated intelligence concepts, our approach surpasses current methods by enabling privacy-compliant, high-fidelity domain adaptation across heterogeneous institutions, fueling broader adoption in high-stakes fields.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a comprehensive federated learning pipeline customized for RAG models consisting of a dual-module architecture: a dense retriever and a generative language model. Each client node fine-tunes local retriever and generator components on domain-specific data and interaction signals, utilizing separate federated update streams. Locally, the retriever is updated via contrastive learning on client data, while the generator fine-tunes on retrieved context and local target texts. To preserve privacy, we integrate per-client adaptive Gaussian differential privacy mechanisms with carefully budgeted epsilon-delta parameters tracked via Renyi Differential Privacy accounting, ensuring rigorous privacy guarantees. Communication efficiency is achieved through a hybrid update protocol combining gradient sparsification and low-rank parameter updates, tuned to RAG’s modular structure and communicated asynchronously. Federated aggregation leverages FedProx with robust proximal terms to mitigate client heterogeneity and non-IID data challenges. We further enhance robustness by implementing personalization layers post-aggregation to fine-tune models to specific client distributions. Our system supports modular federated intelligence enabling dynamic adjustment of privacy budgets and communication frequency based on client resource profiles, inspired by human-computer and human-robot interaction paradigms in adaptive distributed learning scenarios, ensuring scalability across high-performance computing-enabled institutional clients.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset Preparation: Curate realistic, domain-heterogeneous datasets simulating sensitive data scenarios—e.g., partitioned EHR datasets for healthcare, and proprietary financial document corpora—enforcing strict data siloing and privacy constraints. 2. Baselines & Metrics: Implement centralized and conventional federated baselines (FedAvg, FedProx without privacy) using established RAG benchmarks. Define evaluation metrics including retrieval recall@k, generation ROUGE/BLEU, privacy budget consumption (epsilon), communication overhead metrics, and robustness against client drift. 3. Federated System Implementation: Develop the dual-stream federated training pipeline with differential privacy (adaptive Gaussian noise injection) integrated at local update stages. Incorporate communication protocols employing gradient sparsification and low-rank updates for bandwidth reduction. 4. Experimental Controls & Ablations: Systematically vary privacy budgets, communication constraints, and aggregation strategies to isolate their impact on utility and privacy. Further, evaluate personalization layers’ contribution versus pure federated aggregation. 5. Privacy Attack Simulations: Conduct white-box and black-box membership inference and gradient inversion attacks aligned with federated threat models to empirically validate privacy guarantees. 6. Runtime and Scalability Profiling: Measure wall-clock time, communication rounds, and compute resource utilization across simulated high-performance computing client settings to assess system feasibility and scalability. 7. Benchmark against fallback strategies such as hybrid centralized-federated training and offline synthetic data augmentation to contextualize performance and privacy tradeoffs.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Institution A (hospital) submits patient diagnostic queries; Institution B (financial firm) processes regulatory compliance queries. Without sharing raw queries or click data, each institution fine-tunes its local retriever and generator modules. Federated aggregation aggregates model updates with adaptive differential privacy noise and optimized communication protocols. Expected Output: Locally personalized RAG models with improved retrieval relevance (e.g., precision at 10 > baseline by 5%) and generation accuracy (ROUGE-1 improvement >4%) while maintaining formal privacy guarantees (epsilon < 1.0) and reduced communication overhead (bandwidth usage reduced by 30%). Robustness demonstrated via resistance to membership inference attacks with attack accuracy near random guess.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated convergence stalls due to high client heterogeneity, we will incrementally introduce stronger personalization layers individualized to client data distributions and implement hybrid training schemes combining local unsupervised pretraining with federated supervised adaptation. Should differential privacy degrade utility excessively, we will explore relaxed privacy definitions (e.g., zCDP), and incorporate homomorphic encryption selectively on sensitive update components to balance privacy and utility. Offline synthetic data generation using generative models trained locally will be evaluated as an augmentation to enrich model adaptation under privacy constraints."

For example, it is unclear how retriever-generator modules are locally fine-tuned in federated settings, which specific differential privacy techniques and parameters will be used, and how communication-efficient protocols are concretely applied given the complexity of RAG components. The method should clarify the architecture adjustments for federated aggregation, privacy budget accounting, and robustness to client heterogeneity to ensure conceptual soundness and practical implementation feasibility. Addressing these would strengthen the methodological clarity and rigor substantially, providing confidence in the approach's validity and distinguishing it from existing federated domain adaptation works with privacy constraints in NLP-like settings. This critique targets the 'Proposed_Method' section specifically to request comprehensive elaboration on model update mechanisms, privacy integration, and communication protocol design tailored to RAG systems in federated learning settings, beyond broad-stroke descriptions currently presented."

Key missing details include: definition and sourcing of realistic heterogeneous client datasets with domain shift and privacy constraints; baseline selection and metric justification beyond accuracy to quantify privacy-utility tradeoffs; experimental controls to isolate effects of federated algorithms vs. personalization layers from fallback options; and concrete methodology for privacy attack simulations including threat models and attack vectors. Including plans for federated system runtime profiling and scalability with realistic communication constraints would further improve feasibility assessment. Strengthening these experiment plan components, especially dataset realism, privacy benchmarks, and fallback evaluation metrics, is necessary to ensure scientific soundness and reproducibility. This feedback is targeted at the 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' to encourage detailed, pragmatic experimental planning that realistically tests both domain adaptation gains and privacy guarantees in federated RAG research."
