    "title": "Cross-Modal Privacy-Preserving Retrieval-Augmented Prompting in Biomedical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Biomedical LLMs currently underexplore privacy-preserving retrieval mechanisms that incorporate cross-modal biomedical data (text, imaging, signals), hampering model grounding, reasoning, and clinical applicability in sensitive environments.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the external gap (b) about privacy-preserving cross-modal retrieval and internal gap (4) concerning underexplored multimodal integration. It proposes a novel framework that unifies privacy guarantees with knowledge-augmented prompt engineering across data modalities, which existing models neglect.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining multi-modal embeddings (text, images, biosignals) with privacy-preserving retrieval protocols (differential privacy, homomorphic encryption). The retrieval module fetches relevant biomedical evidence mapped to prompt context dynamically. A knowledge graph bridges structured domain knowledge to enhance prompt tuning. This framework composes prompts with fused multi-modal evidence in a privacy-aware manner, enabling respected few-shot learning in clinical settings.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect publicly available biomedical multi-modal datasets with paired modalities. 2. Build retrieval indices with privacy mechanisms and a knowledge graph embedding system. 3. Implement retrieval-augmented prompt engineering in biomedical LLMs (BioGPT, Med-PaLM variants). 4. Baselines: prompt tuning without retrieval, retrieval without privacy, uni-modal retrieval. 5. Metrics: BLEU for generation quality, retrieval precision/recall, privacy guarantee metrics, clinical relevance measured by domain expert evaluation. 6. Ablation on privacy parameters and modality fusion strategies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical note \"Patient with shortness of breath and chest pain\" plus chest X-ray image and ECG signal. Expected output: Accurate diagnostic summary leveraging text and image signals retrieved silently under privacy constraints, e.g., \"Findings consistent with early signs of congestive heart failure.\"",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If privacy mechanisms degrade performance, relax privacy budget and explore federated retrieval. If multi-modal fusion hurts, isolate modality contributions to tune fusion strategies or focus on best-performing modality integration."

        "title": "Cross-Modal Privacy-Preserving Retrieval-Augmented Prompting in Biomedical LLMs with Detailed Mechanisms and Feasibility Framework",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current biomedical large language models (LLMs) inadequately integrate privacy-preserving, cross-modal retrieval of heterogeneous biomedical data—including text, imaging, and physiological signals—leading to suboptimal model grounding and reasoning in sensitive clinical environments. Existing approaches often under-specify the mechanisms balancing privacy constraints with multi-modal fusion effectiveness, restricting practical deployment in high-stakes healthcare settings.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the critical external gap of privacy-preserving cross-modal retrieval and the internal gap of under-explored multimodal biomedical data integration, this work advances beyond existing methods by providing a rigorously specified, technically feasible framework that operates within strict privacy guarantees without compromising retrieval quality or clinical relevance. By explicitly detailing the interaction of privacy protocols, multi-modal embeddings, and knowledge graph bridging in prompt construction, and embedding state-of-the-art vision-language models and contrastive learning techniques, our approach significantly strengthens feasibility, interpretability, and clinical applicability, thereby offering a competitive, novel contribution to biomedical AI.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular, dynamically compositional retrieval-augmented generation architecture grounded in three tightly integrated components: (1) Multi-modal Embeddings & Retrieval: Utilize pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., MedCLIP-like architectures) and contrastive learning to encode biomedical text, images, and biosignals into a shared latent space. Retrieval indices employ differential privacy (DP) at the output query level to perturb retrieval-related signals, balancing privacy and precision, and, optionally, homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure query execution where latency budgets permit. DP privacy budgets are adaptively calibrated using per-query sensitivity analysis to preserve clinical signal integrity. (2) Knowledge Graph Embedding Bridge: Integrate a biomedical knowledge graph embedding (e.g., using RotatE or ComplEx) to semantically augment retrieved evidence. The knowledge graph entity embeddings are combined with multi-modal retrieval outputs via a privacy-aware fusion module that leverages attention mechanisms constrained by DP noise. (3) Privacy-aware Prompt Composition: Compose few-shot learning prompts by combining retrieved multi-modal evidences and enriched knowledge-graph context. The prompt builder dynamically adjusts incorporation weights via learned gating networks that account for privacy noise and information signal strength. The system ensures privacy guarantees via DP parameters articulated for each module, enabling clear tracing of privacy-utility trade-offs. We explicitly handle latency constraints by implementing HE selectively on costly operations, allowing a tunable trade-off between computational overhead and privacy strength. Throughout, federated retrieval experiments are designed as an incremental privacy-performance trade-off baseline. This integrated design leverages multimodal machine learning and intelligent decision-making principles to advance biomedical LLM applications under strict clinical privacy constraints.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset Selection & Preparation: Leverage publicly available biomedical multi-modal datasets with carefully aligned modalities, such as MIMIC-IV (clinical notes + signals), CheXpert (reports + chest X-rays), and PhysioNet Challenge datasets, ensuring clinical representation and compliance with data use agreements. 2. Privacy Mechanism Implementation: Develop modular DP algorithms for multi-modal retrieval outputs, and implement partial HE-based secure retrieval submodules. Privacy budget parameters will be selected based on per-dataset sensitivity informed by pilot experiments and domain expert consultation. 3. Retrieval Index & Knowledge Graph Construction: Build retrieval indices integrating vision-language embeddings and knowledge graph embeddings from UMLS and SNOMED CT, employing privacy-preserving fusion attention modules. 4. Model Integration: Implement the full retrieval-augmented prompt composition pipeline atop biomedical LLMs (BioGPT, Med-PaLM), integrating multi-modal evidence fusion. 5. Evaluation Protocol: Evaluate generation quality using BLEU, retrieval precision/recall, and privacy metrics (epsilon values, composition accounting). Clinical relevance will be assessed through blinded evaluation by at least three board-certified clinicians using standardized scoring rubrics (e.g., diagnostic accuracy, coherence), with statistical power calculations determining sample sizes (~200 cases). 6. Ablation Studies: Systematically vary DP privacy budgets, HE usage, modality fusion weights, and knowledge graph inclusion to analyze effects on performance and privacy. 7. Scalability & Latency Profiling: Measure computational cost and latency on realistic biomedical server architectures to verify clinical deployment feasibility. 8. Incremental Integration Strategy: Begin with uni-modal DP retrieval, then add multi-modal fusion and finally HE, ensuring stepwise verification and graceful degradation fallback strategies.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A clinical note \"Patient with shortness of breath and chest pain,\" combined with a chest X-ray image and ECG signal from the same patient instance. The system retrieves related multi-modal biomedical evidence under privacy constraints using DP-perturbed retrieval queries and submits encrypted or privacy-guarded data to the model. Expected output: A diagnostic summary integrating evidence from all modalities, e.g., \"Findings consistent with early signs of congestive heart failure,\" accompanied by relevant knowledge graph-backed contextual notes. The generation respects privacy parameters, maintaining high retrieval precision and clinically accurate summarization without exposing sensitive patient data.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If privacy mechanisms (e.g., strong DP or HE) significantly degrade performance or cause prohibitive latency, we propose a staged relaxation strategy: initially, limit privacy budget parameters to moderate DP values, continuously monitoring clinical signal degradation, then experiment with federated retrieval architectures to distribute computations and reduce privacy leakage risks. Should multi-modal fusion prove detrimental, detailed modality-level ablation and gating adjustment will isolate and emphasize high-contribution modalities, possibly deferring integration to best-performing subset (e.g., text + imaging). This fallback ensures stepwise progression towards a viable system balancing privacy, performance, and clinical utility for real-world biomedical settings."

Clarify the mechanism for dynamically composing prompts from fused multi-modal evidence while ensuring privacy guarantees—specifically, detail how retrieval, fusion, and knowledge graph embedding operations maintain privacy without degrading signal quality. This clarity is essential to judge technical soundness and replicate the approach reliably in sensitive clinical settings, where errors bear high cost, and the trade-offs between privacy and retrieval effectiveness are subtle and critical to balance effectively. Without this, the framework risks being theoretically interesting but practically unclear or infeasible in real biomedical environments. This should include outlining which privacy-preserving techniques (differential privacy, homomorphic encryption) are applied where and how their privacy parameters relate to retrieval precision in the context of multi-modal fusion and prompt generation for LLMs in a clinical setting at scale and under latency constraints, if any. Enhancing this clarity will strengthen the methodological foundation and improve confidence in feasibility and impact evaluations.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The experimental plan proposes multiple complex components—multi-modal retrieval with privacy mechanisms, knowledge graph embeddings, prompt engineering on biomedical LLMs—yet it lacks concrete feasibility considerations such as dataset availability, computational scalability, and privacy budget selection strategies. While publicly available biomedical multi-modal datasets exist, their alignment with paired modalities suitable for cross-modal retrieval under privacy constraints is challenging. The plan should detail dataset choices and justify their representativeness with respect to intended clinical scenarios. Moreover, implementing rigorous privacy-preserving retrieval (e.g., homomorphic encryption) is computationally intensive; addressing scalability and computational resource requirements is critical for feasibility. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive but would benefit from a clearer plan on how domain expert clinical relevance evaluation will be operationalized, including criteria, blinded protocols, and sample sizes to produce reliable assessments. Finally, contingency plans for degraded retrieval quality under stringent privacy are good but could be further refined by proposing incremental integration steps (for example, starting with differential privacy parametrization experiments before adding homomorphic encryption) to ensure methodical feasibility assessment. Providing these enhancements will increase confidence that the planned experiments can yield meaningful, reproducible results under realistic biomedical operational constraints."
