    "title": "Neuro-Evolutionary Memory Architectures for Adaptive Protein Reasoning",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs with memory-enhanced architectures lack the ability to dynamically adapt and evolve their memory representations over time when integrating protein knowledge bases, undermining long-term reasoning performance for novel biological sequences.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of static memory usage and lack of dynamic memory mechanisms by leveraging evolutionary computation principles to enable continual adaptation of memory-augmented networks, integrating evolving protein data.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a novel neuro-evolutionary memory architecture where memory modules are evolved populations of latent representations, continuously optimized with evolutionary algorithms over streaming protein knowledge base updates. The system uses adaptive selectors to retrieve and update memory cells grounded in protein structure predictions, maintaining persistent yet flexible long-term reasoning capability within LLMs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect dynamic protein knowledge bases (e.g., updates from UniProt and RoseTTAFold predictions). 2. Implement baseline LLM memory-augmented architectures. 3. Integrate an evolutionary strategy (e.g., CMA-ES) to adapt memory representations during continual updates. 4. Evaluate on long-term protein sequence reasoning benchmarks, measuring reasoning accuracy and memory adaptability over time. 5. Compare against static memory baselines and other dynamic memory methods. Metrics include prediction accuracy, adaptation speed, and robustness to novel inputs.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Novel protein sequence with mutations unseen during initial training; Task: Predict folding and functional domains leveraging memory history. Output: Improved structure prediction accuracy compared to static-memory LLMs and evidence of dynamic memory cell updates reflecting new knowledge, enabling better long-range contextual reasoning.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If evolutionary strategies are inefficient, pivot to reinforcement learning-based memory updates with learned update policies. Alternatively, incorporate attention mechanisms with gating to simulate dynamic memory adaptation."
