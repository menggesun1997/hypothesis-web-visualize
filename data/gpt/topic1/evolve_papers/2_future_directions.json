        "title": "Cross-Modal Privacy-Preserving Retrieval-Augmented Prompting in Biomedical LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Biomedical LLMs currently underexplore privacy-preserving retrieval mechanisms that incorporate cross-modal biomedical data (text, imaging, signals), hampering model grounding, reasoning, and clinical applicability in sensitive environments.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the external gap (b) about privacy-preserving cross-modal retrieval and internal gap (4) concerning underexplored multimodal integration. It proposes a novel framework that unifies privacy guarantees with knowledge-augmented prompt engineering across data modalities, which existing models neglect.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining multi-modal embeddings (text, images, biosignals) with privacy-preserving retrieval protocols (differential privacy, homomorphic encryption). The retrieval module fetches relevant biomedical evidence mapped to prompt context dynamically. A knowledge graph bridges structured domain knowledge to enhance prompt tuning. This framework composes prompts with fused multi-modal evidence in a privacy-aware manner, enabling respected few-shot learning in clinical settings.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect publicly available biomedical multi-modal datasets with paired modalities. 2. Build retrieval indices with privacy mechanisms and a knowledge graph embedding system. 3. Implement retrieval-augmented prompt engineering in biomedical LLMs (BioGPT, Med-PaLM variants). 4. Baselines: prompt tuning without retrieval, retrieval without privacy, uni-modal retrieval. 5. Metrics: BLEU for generation quality, retrieval precision/recall, privacy guarantee metrics, clinical relevance measured by domain expert evaluation. 6. Ablation on privacy parameters and modality fusion strategies.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical note \"Patient with shortness of breath and chest pain\" plus chest X-ray image and ECG signal. Expected output: Accurate diagnostic summary leveraging text and image signals retrieved silently under privacy constraints, e.g., \"Findings consistent with early signs of congestive heart failure.\"",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If privacy mechanisms degrade performance, relax privacy budget and explore federated retrieval. If multi-modal fusion hurts, isolate modality contributions to tune fusion strategies or focus on best-performing modality integration."

        "title": "Automated Biomedical Prompt Rule Induction via Knowledge Graph Embeddings",
        "Problem_Statement": "Manual prompt engineering for biomedical few-shot learning is time-consuming and not scalable across diverse biomedical subdomains due to heavy expert involvement.",
        "Motivation": "This proposal directly addresses internal gap (2) on expert-driven prompt design limitations and external gap (d) about utilizing knowledge graph retrieval in prompt tuning. Automating rule induction via knowledge graph embeddings is a transformative step in prompt engineering.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct an automated rule induction framework that uses node and edge embeddings from biomedical knowledge graphs (e.g., UMLS, SNOMED) to generate candidate prompt templates and label words. These are scored and optimized using reinforcement learning and retrieval-augmented LLM feedback loops to select effective prompts for few-shot biomedical relation extraction and classification without manual heuristics.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Obtain biomedical knowledge graphs and preprocess them into embedding spaces. 2. Build a generation module to produce prompt candidates from embeddings. 3. Use RL-based optimization guided by few-shot task performance on biomedical relation extraction datasets like TACRED. 4. Baselines: manual prompt engineering, PTR, KnowPrompt. 5. Metrics: accuracy/F1 on downstream tasks, prompt efficiency (manual effort/time), adaptability across biomedical subdomains.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Relation extraction task between symptoms and diseases. Generated prompt: \"Identify if the sentence implies a symptom indicating a disease relationship.\" Expected output: High classification accuracy comparable or superior to manual prompts with less expert input.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If RL optimization is unstable, switch to evolutionary or gradient-free search methods for prompt rule selection. If embedding-driven rules are sparse, enrich graph with external databases or couple with textual semantic similarity."

        "title": "Multi-Modal BLEU-Guided Neural Prompt Translation and Synthesis for Biomedical Text Generation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Biomedical report generation and natural language synthesis fail to effectively leverage multi-modal data and BLEU-based evaluation feedback for optimizing quality and clinical accuracy.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the external gap (a) about insufficient linkage between BLEU scores, multi-modal data, and retrieval in biomedical generation tasks, this idea innovates by introducing BLEU-guided neural prompt translation and synthesis exploiting multi-modal cues for prompt design improvements.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a neural architecture that translates and synthesizes prompts by backpropagating BLEU-based evaluation signals through a multi-modal encoder-decoder pipeline conditioned on images, text, and signals. Retrieval modules augment prompt contexts with relevant evidence, closing the loop between evaluation metrics and prompt refinement in a differentiable manner.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect paired biomedical data: text reports, imaging (X-rays), signals (ECG). 2. Implement multi-modal encoder to extract embeddings. 3. Train a decoder generating prompt texts, guided by BLEU scores from generated biomedical summaries. 4. Baselines: static prompts; prompt tuning without BLEU loop; single modality prompts. 5. Metrics: BLEU, clinical correctness (domain expert annotation), fluency, diversity of generated reports.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Chest X-ray image and clinical metadata for a patient. System generates a prompt refined to yield a clinical summary with a BLEU score increase (e.g., from 0.55 to 0.70) against reference reports, demonstrating enhanced text fidelity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If BLEU backpropagation is noisy, smooth metric approximation techniques or surrogate metrics (ROUGE, METEOR) will be used. If multi-modal fusion causes instability, separate modality pathways may be experimented with before late fusion."

        "Problem_Statement": "Biomedical datasets like TACRED are limited by annotation noise, sparse domain coverage, and insufficient multi-source annotations, impacting model reliability and performance.",
        "Motivation": "Responds to internal gap (3) about dataset limitations and external gap (c) on integrating transfer learning and advanced annotation strategies. This idea combines multi-source annotation aggregation, noise-robust learning, and synthetic privacy-aware augmentation to create high-quality expanded datasets.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a pipeline combining multi-source biomedical expert annotations, crowd-sourced signals, and weak supervision with noise-aware reweighting algorithms. Incorporate synthetic data generation techniques respecting privacy constraints (e.g., GANs or VAEs with differential privacy) to augment data coverage. Apply transfer learning from general LLMs and linguistic computational methods to refine entity and relation quality.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Aggregate existing datasets and new annotation sources for biomedical relations. 2. Implement noise-robust training algorithms (e.g., co-teaching, loss correction). 3. Generate privacy-preserving synthetic samples via deep generative models. 4. Evaluate using held-out expert-labeled validation sets. 5. Baselines: standard TACRED training; existing synthetic data augmentation; no denoising methods. 6. Metrics: F1 scores, annotation agreement statistics, model uncertainty calibration.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Relation extraction sentence with noisy or conflicting labels. After denoising, model outputs consistent relation classification, e.g., correctly identifying \"Drugâ€“Disease\" interaction despite initial label noise.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If synthetic data decreases model generalization, reduce synthetic portion or improve realism of generative models. If noise reduction hampers learning, experiment with alternative denoising schemes or active learning for human-in-the-loop corrections."

        "title": "Federated Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Prompt Tuning Framework for Distributed Biomedical LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Biomedical LLM fine-tuning and prompt engineering suffer from data privacy constraints limiting access to centralized clinical datasets, restricting model adaptation and knowledge grounding.",
        "Motivation": "This idea merges external gap (b) on privacy-preserving retrieval with internal gaps (2) and (4) by proposing a federated learning approach that integrates knowledge graphs and prompt tuning across distributed clinical sites, preserving privacy while enriching model knowledge.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a federated prompt tuning system where hospitals locally tune LLM prompts leveraging local knowledge graph embeddings and private clinical data. Aggregation protocols coordinate prompt parameter sharing without exposing raw data. This federated knowledge graph-enabled tuning iteratively improves prompt quality across centers while maintaining strict privacy compliance.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Simulate distributed clinical data environments with local knowledge graphs. 2. Implement federated prompt tuning protocols with encryption and differential privacy. 3. Compare against centralized prompt tuning and naive federated tuning without knowledge graph integration. 4. Use biomedical relation extraction and question answering benchmarks. 5. Metrics: model accuracy, prompt adaptation speed, privacy leakage measures, communication cost.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Local clinical text at hospital A tuned into domain-specific prompt, aggregated with hospitals B and C to build a robust multi-center biomedical LLM prompt. Output: Improved few-shot relation extraction across sites without raw data sharing.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated optimization converges poorly, explore hybrid aggregation methods or local fine-tuning combined with prompt tuning. If privacy noise degrades model, calibrate differential privacy budgets or rely on secure multiparty computation."
