    "title": "Federated Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Prompt Tuning Framework for Distributed Biomedical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Biomedical LLM fine-tuning and prompt engineering suffer from data privacy constraints limiting access to centralized clinical datasets, restricting model adaptation and knowledge grounding.",
    "Motivation": "This idea merges external gap (b) on privacy-preserving retrieval with internal gaps (2) and (4) by proposing a federated learning approach that integrates knowledge graphs and prompt tuning across distributed clinical sites, preserving privacy while enriching model knowledge.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a federated prompt tuning system where hospitals locally tune LLM prompts leveraging local knowledge graph embeddings and private clinical data. Aggregation protocols coordinate prompt parameter sharing without exposing raw data. This federated knowledge graph-enabled tuning iteratively improves prompt quality across centers while maintaining strict privacy compliance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Simulate distributed clinical data environments with local knowledge graphs. 2. Implement federated prompt tuning protocols with encryption and differential privacy. 3. Compare against centralized prompt tuning and naive federated tuning without knowledge graph integration. 4. Use biomedical relation extraction and question answering benchmarks. 5. Metrics: model accuracy, prompt adaptation speed, privacy leakage measures, communication cost.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Local clinical text at hospital A tuned into domain-specific prompt, aggregated with hospitals B and C to build a robust multi-center biomedical LLM prompt. Output: Improved few-shot relation extraction across sites without raw data sharing.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated optimization converges poorly, explore hybrid aggregation methods or local fine-tuning combined with prompt tuning. If privacy noise degrades model, calibrate differential privacy budgets or rely on secure multiparty computation."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while comprehensive, could be strengthened by including more realistic simulation conditions that reflect the heterogeneity and noise typical in real-world distributed clinical data. It lacks explicit consideration of practical issues such as varying data schemas, site participation dropout, and network unreliability, which could impact federated prompt tuning convergence and communication cost. The plan should also clarify how privacy guarantees are quantitatively evaluated and balanced against model utility, to ensure feasibility under strict regulatory compliance. Including ablation studies to isolate the contribution of knowledge graph integration versus federated tuning alone would strengthen empirical validation and feasibility assessment further. Adding these elements will increase the robustness and practical guidance of the experimental evaluation framework in clinical settings, thereby solidifying feasibility claims for deployment scenarios and regulatory expectations. The current plan risks being theoretically plausible but experimentally under-specified for real clinical environments, which are notably complex and sensitive contexts.  This enhancement is crucial prior to attempting deployment or broader claims on adaptation speed and privacy leakage metrics effectiveness in the biomedical domain where data sensitivity is paramount and heterogeneity is high.  In short, expand and detail experimental contingencies and privacy-utility trade-offs to robustly demonstrate true feasibility of the approach in realistic federated biomedical settings where prompt tuning is applied alongside knowledge graphs and clinical data privacy constraints are stringent and heterogeneous across sites and use cases.  Also make clear how clinical validation benchmarks relate to practical biomedical knowledge and downstream tasks beyond system metrics to strengthen confidence in real-world impact of the experimental validation approach itself, further promoting feasibility and acceptance of the idea by domain stakeholders and regulatory entities alike in practice and production-scale trials/systems deployment contexts.  This will position the experiment plan as feasible, reliable, and clinically meaningful rather than lab-only or overly idealized, thus essential to the next phase of research translation and impact evaluation within biomedical federated learning and prompt tuning research communities and clinical AI stakeholders.  The proposed methods' rigor and practicality rest critically on these expansions to the investigation plan and corresponding metrics and evaluation protocols, so please incorporate these points explicitly in the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan to better demonstrate feasibility and practical reliability of the approach for biomedical LLM prompt tuning attaining privacy-preserving knowledge enrichment across distributed clinical sites sensibly and rigorously, accounting for all key biomedical federated learning challenges and operational constraints realistically and explicitly alongside privacy levels and noise calibration practices that impact model performance and clinical validity ultimately.  This is the single largest gap the proposal must address to ensure successful follow-up progress and eventual impact in the highly privacy-sensitive biomedical AI domain, turning a solid conceptual approach into a rigorously tested, reproducible, and clinically valuable federated knowledge graph-enhanced prompt tuning methodology ready for wider adoption and scrutiny, fundamentally reinforcing feasibility rather than under-specifying empirical validation or privacy benchmarking approaches as currently done in the initial plan, which is somewhat sparse and idealized without sufficient treatment of core biomedical federated learning difficulties and privacy-utility trade-offs at scale and in the wild clinical environment contexts expected.  The proposal will be significantly strengthened and verifiability and reproducibility improved by undertaking this major enhancement of the experimental evaluation protocol and metrics explicitly before progressing further with model or systems implementation phase or making claims of superior privacy and/or performance benefits under realistic clinical deployment constraints and federated architectures and privacy regulations like HIPAA or GDPR.  Consequently, this key improvement must be addressed upfront to ensure the feasibility of the entire proposed methodology aligns with actual clinical and regulatory realities, beyond idealized simulation-based or conceptual validation scenarios without nuanced details and contingency plans included for realistic conditions and robustness assessment through comprehensive experimental scrutiny and realistic biomedical data testbeds and distributed federated learning simulation fidelity improvement, linking privacy measures to clinical task relevance directly to validate practical biomedical AI utility, trustworthiness, and regulatory compliance feasibility with clarity and rigor, strengthening the research contribution's trustworthiness and eventual translational value in biomedical AI prompt and federated learning research lines in the community and clinical informatics applications targeting biomedical knowledge enhancement without direct data sharing in multi-center clinical ecosystems under privacy-preserving constraints simultaneously.  Addressing this significant shortfall will boost confidence for reviewers, practitioners, and regulatory bodies evaluating this proposal's readiness and feasibility for adoption and scrutiny in real biomedical AI federation contexts, significantly raising the contribution's perceived feasibility and practical impact value and making it more competitive as well for high-tier conference venues and clinical AI adoption.  Please explicitly refine the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan accordingly.  Thank you!

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "To enhance both the novelty and broader impact of this federated knowledge graph-enhanced prompt tuning framework, the proposal should explicitly integrate concepts such as 'domain shift' and 'target domain' adaptation from the globally-linked concepts, focusing on heterogeneity across biomedical sites. This would allow the method to explicitly tackle domain shifts common in biomedical data across hospitals and patient populations, increasing robustness and generalization. Additionally, linking the approach with 'Transformer-based language models' beyond general LLM mentions and exploring integration with 'intelligent decision-making' systems in clinical workflows can significantly raise impact, showing downstream benefits. Incorporating 'human-centric artificial intelligence' principles to improve clinician interpretability and trust in federated prompt tuning adaptations can further differentiate the work. Lastly, leveraging 'electronic health records' and potentially 'genomic analysis' as enriched local knowledge graphs would ground the method in critical biomedical domains with high impact potential. These linkage points and broader integration promise to elevate the proposal from a novel federated tuning framework to a comprehensive, domain-aware, human-centered biomedical AI system with practical translational appeal and higher novelty standing. Consider these integration pathways as a global suggestion to boost novelty and multi-dimensional impact beyond the current core federated prompt tuning niche, aligning tightly with leading biomedical AI challenges and community priorities in data heterogeneity, privacy, interpretability, and translational clinical impact.
