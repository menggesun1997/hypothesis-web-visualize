Negative unintended consequences abound including the perpetuation and exacerbation of societal inequalities and divisions via algorithmic decision making. We present six grand challenges for the scientific community to create AI technologies that are human-centered, that is, ethical, fair, and enhance the human condition. These grand challenges are the result of an international collaboration across academia, industry and government and represent the consensus views of a group of 26 experts in the field of human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI). In essence, these challenges advocate for a human-centered approach to AI that (1) is centered in human well-being, (2) is designed responsibly, (3) respects privacy, (4) follows human-centered design principles, (5) is subject to appropriate governance and oversight, and (6) interacts with individuals while respecting human’s cognitive capacities. We hope that these challenges and their associated research directions serve as a call for action to conduct research and development in AI that serves as a force multiplier towards more fair, equitable and sustainable societies.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'The false hope of current approaches to explainable artificial intelligence in health care', 'abstract': 'The black-box nature of current artificial intelligence (AI) has caused some to question whether AI must be explainable to be used in high-stakes scenarios such as medicine. It has been argued that explainable AI will engender trust with the health-care workforce, provide transparency into the AI decision making process, and potentially mitigate various kinds of bias. In this Viewpoint, we argue that this argument represents a false hope for explainable AI and that current explainability methods are unlikely to achieve these goals for patient-level decision support. We provide an overview of current explainability techniques and highlight how various failure cases can cause problems for decision making for individual patients. In the absence of suitable explainability methods, we advocate for rigorous internal and external validation of AI models as a more direct means of achieving the goals often associated with explainability, and we caution against having explainability be a requirement for clinically deployed models.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations', 'abstract': 'Health systems rely on commercial prediction algorithms to identify and help patients with complex health needs. We show that a widely used algorithm, typical of this industry-wide approach and affecting millions of patients, exhibits significant racial bias: At a given risk score, Black patients are considerably sicker than White patients, as evidenced by signs of uncontrolled illnesses. Remedying this disparity would increase the percentage of Black patients receiving additional help from 17.7 to 46.5%. The bias arises because the algorithm predicts health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for White patients. Thus, despite health care cost appearing to be an effective proxy for health by some measures of predictive accuracy, large racial biases arise. We suggest that the choice of convenient, seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can be an important source of algorithmic bias in many contexts.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': \"Big Data's Disparate Impact\", 'abstract': 'Advocates of algorithmic techniques like data mining argue that these techniques eliminate human biases from the decision-making process. But an algorithm is only as good as the data it works with. Data is frequently imperfect in ways that allow these algorithms to inherit the prejudices of prior decision makers. In other cases, data may simply reflect the widespread biases that persist in society at large. In still others, data mining can discover surprisingly useful regularities that are really just preexisting patterns of exclusion and inequality. Unthinking reliance on data mining can deny historically disadvantaged and vulnerable groups full participation in society. Worse still, because the resulting discrimination is almost always an unintentional emergent property of the algorithm’s use rather than a conscious choice by its programmers, it can be unusually hard to identify the source of the problem or to explain it to a court. This Essay examines these concerns through the lens of American antidiscrimination law — more particularly, through Title VII’s prohibition of discrimination in employment. In the absence of a demonstrable intent to discriminate, the best doctrinal hope for data mining’s victims would seem to lie in disparate impact doctrine. Case law and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Uniform Guidelines, though, hold that a practice can be justified as a business necessity when its outcomes are predictive of future employment outcomes, and data mining is specifically designed to find such statistical correlations. Unless there is a reasonably practical way to demonstrate that these discoveries are spurious, Title VII would appear to bless its use, even though the correlations it discovers will often reflect historic patterns of prejudice, others’ discrimination against members of protected groups, or flaws in the underlying data Addressing the sources of this unintentional discrimination and remedying the corresponding deficiencies in the law will be difficult technically, difficult legally, and difficult politically. There are a number of practical limits to what can be accomplished computationally. For example, when discrimination occurs because the data being mined is itself a result of past intentional discrimination, there is frequently no obvious method to adjust historical data to rid it of this taint. Corrective measures that alter the results of the data mining after it is complete would tread on legally and politically disputed terrain. These challenges for reform throw into stark relief the tension between the two major theories underlying antidiscrimination law: anticlassification and antisubordination. Finding a solution to big data’s disparate impact will require more than best efforts to stamp out prejudice and bias; it will require a wholesale reexamination of the meanings of “discrimination” and “fairness.”'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases', 'abstract': 'Machine learning is a means to derive artificial intelligence by discovering patterns in existing data. Here, we show that applying machine learning to ordinary human language results in human-like semantic biases. We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing sources of bias in culture, including technology.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Closing the AI accountability gap', 'abstract': \"Rising concern for the societal implications of artificial intelligence systems has inspired a wave of academic and journalistic literature in which deployed systems are audited for harm by investigators from outside the organizations deploying the algorithms. However, it remains challenging for practitioners to identify the harmful repercussions of their own systems prior to deployment, and, once deployed, emergent issues can become difficult or impossible to trace back to their source. In this paper, we introduce a framework for algorithmic auditing that supports artificial intelligence system development end-to-end, to be applied throughout the internal organization development life-cycle. Each stage of the audit yields a set of documents that together form an overall audit report, drawing on an organization's values or principles to assess the fit of decisions made throughout the process. The proposed auditing framework is intended to contribute to closing the accountability gap in the development and deployment of large-scale artificial intelligence systems by embedding a robust process to ensure audit integrity.\"}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild**http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~lz013/projects/FaceAttributes.html', 'abstract': 'Predicting face attributes in the wild is challenging due to complex face variations. We propose a novel deep learning framework for attribute prediction in the wild. It cascades two CNNs, LNet and ANet, which are fine-tuned jointly with attribute tags, but pre-trained differently. LNet is pre-trained by massive general object categories for face localization, while ANet is pre-trained by massive face identities for attribute prediction. This framework not only outperforms the state-of-the-art with a large margin, but also reveals valuable facts on learning face representation. (1) It shows how the performances of face localization (LNet) and attribute prediction (ANet) can be improved by different pre-training strategies. (2) It reveals that although the filters of LNet are fine-tuned only with image-level attribute tags, their response maps over entire images have strong indication of face locations. This fact enables training LNet for face localization with only image-level annotations, but without face bounding boxes or landmarks, which are required by all attribute recognition works. (3) It also demonstrates that the high-level hidden neurons of ANet automatically discover semantic concepts after pretraining with massive face identities, and such concepts are significantly enriched after fine-tuning with attribute tags. Each attribute can be well explained with a sparse linear combination of these concepts.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Model Cards for Model Reporting', 'abstract': 'Trained machine learning models are increasingly used to perform high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement, medicine, education, and employment. In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related artificial intelligence technology, increasing transparency into how well artificial intelligence technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Human-Centered AI', 'abstract': 'Abstract Researchers, developers, business leaders, policy makers, and others are expanding the technology-centered scope of artificial intelligence (AI) to include human-centered AI (HCAI) ways of thinking. This expansion from an algorithm-focused view to embrace a human-centered perspective can shape the future of technology so as to better serve human needs. Educators, designers, software engineers, product managers, evaluators, and government agency staffers can build on AI-driven technologies to design products and services that make life better for people and enable people to care for each other. Humans have always been tool builders, and now they are supertool builders, whose inventions can improve our health, family life, education, business, the environment, and much more. The remarkable progress in algorithms for machine and deep learning have opened the doors to new opportunities, and some dark possibilities. However, a bright future awaits AI researchers, developers, business leaders, policy makers, and others who build on their working methods by including HCAI strategies of design and testing. This enlarged vision can shape the future of technology so as to better serve human needs.

Trustworthy AI (TAI) bases on the idea that trust builds the foundation of societies, economies, and sustainable development, and that individuals, organizations, and societies will therefore only ever be able to realize the full potential of AI, if trust can be established in its development, deployment, and use. With this article we aim to introduce the concept of TAI and its five foundational principles (1) beneficence, (2) non-maleficence, (3) autonomy, (4) justice, and (5) explicability. We further draw on these five principles to develop a data-driven research framework for TAI and demonstrate its utility by delineating fruitful avenues for future research, particularly with regard to the distributed ledger technology-based realization of TAI.'}]\n```\n\n**Part A.2: The Evolution Links (Edges of the Graph):**\nThe following list defines the citation relationships between the papers in Part A.

scientific progress. Analyze how the core problems and methods have evolved through the papers (A.1). Synthesize this evolutionary understanding with the local (Part B) and global (Part C) context. This deep understanding will be the foundation for your final report.\n\n**Step 2: Generate the Final Research Landscape Map (This is your ONLY output)**\nNow, based on the deep insights gained from your internal analysis in Step 1, generate a concise and insightful report. The report **MUST** contain ONLY the following three sections:\n\n**1. Current Research Landscape & Core Consensus:**\n- What is the central problem and dominant methodology of the **current** state-of-the-art? Your summary should reflect the insights from the evolutionary analysis (e.g., 'the current focus on X is a direct response to the limitations of the earlier Y').\n- Use the Central Nodes (B.1) and Thematic Islands (B.2) to support your summary.\n\n**2. Critical Gaps & Unexplored Frontiers:**\n- **Internal Gaps:** What limitations are present in the recent papers? What weaknesses are revealed by the overall evolutionary trajectory (e.g., 'the field has consistently overlooked problem Z throughout its evolution')?\n- **External/Novel Gaps:** Based on the Global Context (Part C), what novel connections or cross-disciplinary approaches have been overlooked?\n\n**3. High-Potential Innovation Opportunities:**\n- Based on the identified gaps, propose 2-3 high-level, innovative research directions.\n- Each opportunity should be justified by linking a Global Opportunity (from Part C) with a problem or limitation identified in your analysis.\n",

    "title": "Research Landscape Map on Incorporating Knowledge Bases into LLMs for Fairness and Bias Mitigation",
    "current_research_landscape": "The current state-of-the-art research centers on addressing algorithmic bias and fairness in AI systems—specifically through human-centered artificial intelligence approaches within high-stakes domains like health care. The dominant methodology involves scrutinizing algorithms' reliance on imperfect proxies (e.g., health care costs) that encode systemic disparities, exemplified by racial biases impacting Black patients despite ostensibly accurate predictive models. Concurrently, there is strong emphasis on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to illuminate black-box models, though recent critique labels many explainability methods as insufficient alone, motivating rigorous model auditing and accountability processes. The thematic core integrates insights on health disparities, antidiscrimination laws, and semantic biases encoded in language corpora harvested from large text datasets like the World Wide Web. These insights highlight that historic social biases permeate training data, necessitating integrative frameworks combining human-centered design, transparency, and legal accountability mechanisms to mitigate bias and promote fairness within AI-driven decision support systems.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internally, a key limitation is the persistent reliance on flawed proxies such as health care costs that encode historic social inequities, which existing debiasing and explainability methods insufficiently address. Explainability techniques often fail to provide actionable transparency for individual-level decisions, undermining trust and fairness in clinical AI applications. Moreover, the human-centered AI movement, while advocating for ethical design, struggles to systematically incorporate legal anti-discrimination mandates and practical enforcement into algorithmic pipelines. Externally, the global context analysis reveals overlooked interdisciplinary connections, such as exploiting natural language processing advances and clinical language models (e.g., Named Entity Recognition) to better understand and correct social determinants of health embedded in unstructured health data. Additionally, integrating legal frameworks enforcing antidiscrimination with technical model audit frameworks remains underdeveloped. Finally, domain-adaptive pretraining of language models that incorporate fairness constraints linked with healthcare socio-legal knowledge is a novel frontier yet to be rigorously explored.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "1. Develop hybrid AI frameworks that combine semantic knowledge from language corpora and structured knowledge bases on health equity and antidiscrimination laws with LLMs to detect and mitigate proxy-driven biases in clinical prediction models. This innovation harnesses insights from Global Concepts linking 'care costs' and 'language corpora' to address biases arising from flawed ground truth proxies.\n\n2. Design robust explainability and auditing methodologies that integrate human-centered principles with legal compliance requirements. Embedding ontologies encoding antidiscrimination statutes and healthcare practice standards into explanation generation could enhance fairness accountability and user trust, thereby bridging gaps between technical XAI and legal oversight highlighted by linking 'explainability methods' and 'antidiscrimination laws.'\n\n3. Implement domain-adaptive pretraining of large language models incorporating clinical language understanding, social determinants of health, and ethical guidelines to develop context-aware AI assistants. These would support primary care providers in equitable decision-making, addressing cross-disciplinary gaps revealed by the co-concepts in the GPS analysis associating 'care costs' with 'human-centered AI' and natural language processing advancements."
