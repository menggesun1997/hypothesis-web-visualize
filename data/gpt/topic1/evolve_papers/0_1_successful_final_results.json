    "title": "Retrieval Noise Injection for Robust LLM Generation via Noise-Aware Prompt Engineering",
    "Problem_Statement": "Non-relevant or random documents were unexpectedly found to improve LLM generation accuracy, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood, limiting the ability to purposefully exploit retrieval noise.",
    "Motivation": "This targets the critical external conceptual gap regarding the role of retrieval noise in improving generation robustness. By systematizing noise-aware retrieval prompt design and joint training, this research builds a theoretical and practical foundation to harness beneficial noise patterns.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a noise injection framework for RAG where controlled stochastic perturbations to retrieval inputs (random, semi-random, context-shifted documents) are combined with specialized noise-aware prompting strategies for the generator. Implement a joint training regime where the retriever learns to balance true relevance and structured noise, while the generator is trained to leverage contextual diversity induced by noise to improve factuality and reduce hallucinations. Visualization and interpretability tools will analyze how noise affects attention and generation pathways.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use standard QA datasets (Natural Questions, TriviaQA) as baseline. 2. Implement noise injection strategies: purely random retrieval, context-drifted vs. semantically related noise. 3. Train noise-aware prompts for GPT-based generations under varying noise conditions. 4. Perform controlled experiments comparing end-to-end joint training with independent retriever/generator training. 5. Evaluate with metrics for accuracy, hallucination rates, and factual consistency. 6. Conduct ablation on noise levels and document types.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Question: 'Who is the CEO of Tesla?' Retrieval set injected with a mixture of relevant Tesla news articles plus random unrelated sport articles. Expected Output: Despite noise, the generator reliably outputs 'Elon Musk' due to learned robustness and noise-informed prompt design.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If noise injection disrupts generation quality, revert to soft noise schedules with gradual introduction, or incorporate denoising modules. Alternatively, explore hybrid deterministic and stochastic retrieval fusion with generator ensembles to enhance robustness."

        "title": "Contrastive Noise Injection and Few-Shot Noise-Aware Prompting for Robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation",
        "Problem_Statement": "While retrieval augmentation typically assumes that relevant documents boost large language model (LLM) generation, recent observations reveal that certain non-relevant or noisy documents can unexpectedly improve generation robustness and factuality. However, the exact boundary conditions and mechanisms under which retrieval noise benefits or harms generation remain unclear, leading to speculative assumptions and limiting purposeful exploitation. This creates a critical knowledge gap: understanding which types of noise contribute positively to robustness, why structured noise can aid generalization, and how to systematically leverage such noise in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models without degrading performance.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing this foundational gap enables principled, interpretable methods to harness retrieval noise for robust LLM generation—a salient challenge as retrieval sources scale and diversify. By grounding noise benefits in empirical and theoretical analyses, and by integrating advances in contrastive learning and few-shot prompting, our research offers a novel framework to discriminate and induce beneficial noise patterns. This surpasses incremental noise-injection heuristics and typical prompt tuning by structuring noise-aware learning and robustifying generation via few-shot adaptation. Furthermore, exploring domain-inspired multi-modal noise and robust retrieval strategies, such as those drawn from biomedical time series and video-language models, aligns with critical applications including intelligent decision-making and Critical Infrastructure Protection where robustness against noisy input is mission-critical. This multidisciplinary integration establishes a competitively novel contribution with broad impact potential.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a comprehensive framework combining: (1) contrastive noise calibration—where contrastive learning objectives enable the retriever to distinguish between helpful structured noise (e.g., semantically related but not topically relevant documents) and harmful noise (purely random or irrelevant documents). This allows dynamic noise weighting rather than binary relevance scoring. (2) Few-shot noise-aware prompt tuning for the generator, leveraging small exemplars augmented with controlled noise permutations to teach the model how to interpret noisy retrievals effectively. (3) A joint training regimen that alternates between retriever contrastive noise calibration and few-shot prompt refinement, fostering synergy between retrieval noise patterns and generation robustness. (4) Exploration of multi-modal and domain-specific noise patterns inspired by video-language retrieval and biomedical time series irregularities, to enhance robustness in specialized contexts. (5) Comprehensive theoretical analyses to characterize the boundary conditions for beneficial noise effects and failure modes, supported by interpretability tools analyzing attention and generation pathways influenced by noise. This multi-pronged approach transcends existing heuristics, enabling principled, scalable, and interpretable robustness enhancement in RAG.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Empirically benchmark retrieval noise effects by replicating existing observations on standard QA datasets (Natural Questions, TriviaQA), establishing baseline noise-benefit curves. 2. Implement contrastive learning objectives in retriever training to discriminate structured beneficial noise from harmful noise; evaluate noise classification accuracy and downstream influence on generation. 3. Develop few-shot noise-aware prompt tuning pipelines using exemplar augmentations with varying noise types and levels. 4. Conduct joint contrastive-prompt training and compare against independent training baselines for metrics including accuracy, hallucination rate, and factual consistency. 5. Extend noise injection experiments to multi-modal datasets inspired by video-language and biomedical time series retrieval to test robustness across modalities and domains. 6. Use interpretability analyses (e.g., attention attribution) to understand how noise influences generation pathways. 7. Perform ablations on noise types, levels, and their interplay with joint training strategies to delineate boundary conditions for robustness gains. 8. Test social-impact scenarios from intelligent decision-making and Critical Infrastructure Protection domains to demonstrate mission-critical relevance.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: Question: 'Who is the CEO of Tesla?' Retrieval set includes a mix of relevant Tesla news articles, semantically related automotive industry reports (structured noise), and unrelated sports articles (harmful noise). Expected Output: Despite injected noise, the generator outputs the correct answer 'Elon Musk' consistently due to jointly trained contrastive noise-calibrated retriever and few-shot noise-aware prompts enabling discrimination and robustness. Additional Example: In a biomedical retrieval task, temporal mismatch noise is injected (outdated time series data). The model, trained with domain-inspired noise patterns and contrastive objectives, generates factually consistent and up-to-date medical summaries, illustrating cross-domain capability.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If joint contrastive and few-shot training fails to yield robustness improvements, we will explore gradual noise curriculum learning schedules to better condition the model on increasing noise severity. Alternatively, integrate denoising autoencoder modules or adversarial noise filters in retrieval pipelines. Hybrid fusion strategies combining deterministic top-k retrieval with stochastic or noise-enriched retrieval ensembles will be tested. For prompt tuning, fallback includes using hard prompt engineering or retrieval-augmented instructions without few-shot exemplars. If domain-inspired multi-modal noise experiments prove too complex initially, revert to unimodal NLP tasks before scaling up."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that non-relevant or random documents improve LLM generation accuracy requires clearer empirical grounding and theoretical justification. The proposal should better articulate why and under what circumstances noise benefits robustness instead of degrading quality, to solidify the hypothesis before building extensive methods upon it. Incorporating preliminary analyses or citing prior controlled studies of beneficial noise effects in retrieval-augmented generation would strengthen soundness substantially. Without this, the foundation risks being speculative, making the proposed mechanisms harder to validate and interpret reliably at scale, especially since noise typically degrades performance in most retrieval-based tasks. Consider explicitly specifying assumptions about what kinds of noise correlate with improvement and why the joint training can capitalize on these patterns effectively, including potential failure modes and boundary conditions for this assumption's validity. This will make the approach more convincing scientifically and guide subsequent experimental design more precisely, enhancing interpretability and reproducibility of findings for the community.
