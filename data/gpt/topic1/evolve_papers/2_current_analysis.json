Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, spanning from machine learning and deep learning to large model paradigms, stand poised to significantly augment physicians in rendering more evidence-based decisions, thus presenting a pioneering solution for clinical practice. Traditionally, the amalgamation of diverse medical data modalities (e.g., image, text, speech, genetic data, physiological signals) is imperative to facilitate a comprehensive disease analysis, a topic of burgeoning interest among both researchers and clinicians in recent times. Hence, there exists a pressing need to synthesize the latest strides in multi-modal data and AI technologies in the realm of medical diagnosis. In this paper, we narrow our focus to five specific disorders (Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, depression, heart disease, epilepsy), elucidating advanced endeavors in their diagnosis and treatment through the lens of artificial intelligence. Our survey not only delineates detailed diagnostic methodologies across varying modalities but also underscores commonly utilized public datasets, the intricacies of feature engineering, prevalent classification models, and envisaged challenges for future endeavors. In essence, our research endeavors to contribute to the advancement of diagnostic methodologies, furnishing invaluable insights for clinical decision making.\"}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Large language models encode clinical knowledge', 'abstract': 'Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but the bar for clinical applications is high. Attempts to assess the clinical knowledge of models typically rely on automated evaluations based on limited benchmarks. Here, to address these limitations, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing medical question answering datasets spanning professional medicine, research and consumer queries and\\xa0a new dataset of medical questions searched online, HealthSearchQA. We propose a human evaluation framework for model answers along multiple axes including factuality, comprehension,\\xa0reasoning, possible harm and bias. In addition, we evaluate Pathways Language Model1 (PaLM,\\xa0a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM2 on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA3, MedMCQA4, PubMedQA5 and Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) clinical topics6), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA\\xa0(US Medical Licensing Exam-style questions), surpassing the prior state of the art by more than 17%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps. To resolve this, we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, knowledge recall and reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal limitations of today’s models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLMs for clinical applications.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'BioGPT: generative pre-trained transformer for biomedical text generation and mining', 'abstract': 'Pre-trained language models have attracted increasing attention in the biomedical domain, inspired by their great success in the general natural language domain. Among the two main branches of pre-trained language models in the general language domain, i.e. BERT (and its variants) and GPT (and its variants), the first one has been extensively studied in the biomedical domain, such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT. While they have achieved great success on a variety of discriminative downstream biomedical tasks, the lack of generation ability constrains their application scope. In this paper, we propose BioGPT, a domain-specific generative Transformer language model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical literature. We evaluate BioGPT on six biomedical natural language processing tasks and demonstrate that our model outperforms previous models on most tasks. Especially, we get 44.98%, 38.42% and 40.76% F1 score on BC5CDR, KD-DTI and DDI end-to-end relation extraction tasks, respectively, and 78.2% accuracy on PubMedQA, creating a new record. Our case study on text generation further demonstrates the advantage of BioGPT on biomedical literature to generate fluent descriptions for biomedical terms.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Domain-Specific Language Model Pretraining for Biomedical Natural Language Processing', 'abstract': ' Pretraining large neural language models, such as BERT, has led to impressive gains on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, most pretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web. A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by starting from general-domain language models. In this article, we challenge this assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical NLP benchmark from publicly available datasets. Our experiments show that domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of biomedical NLP tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board. Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common practices are unnecessary with BERT models, such as using complex tagging schemes in named entity recognition. To help accelerate research in biomedical NLP, we have released our state-of-the-art pretrained and task-specific models for the community, and created a leaderboard featuring our BLURB benchmark (short for Biomedical Language Understanding & Reasoning Benchmark) at https://aka.ms/BLURB .

This is a big challenge due to some of the triplets extracted from one sentence may have overlapping entities. Most existing methods perform entity recognition followed by relation detection between every possible entity pairs, which usually suffers from numerous redundant operations. In this paper, we propose a relation-specific attention network (RSAN) to handle the issue. Our RSAN utilizes relation-aware attention mechanism to construct specific sentence representations for each relation, and then performs sequence labeling to extract its corresponding head and tail entities. Experiments on two public datasets show that our model can effectively extract overlapping triplets and achieve state-of-the-art performance.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'PTR: Prompt Tuning with Rules for Text Classification', 'abstract': 'Recently, prompt tuning has been widely applied to stimulate the rich knowledge in pre-trained language models (PLMs) to serve NLP tasks. Although prompt tuning has achieved promising results on some few-class classification tasks, such as sentiment classification and natural language inference, manually designing prompts is cumbersome. Meanwhile, generating prompts automatically is also difficult and time-consuming. Therefore, obtaining effective prompts for complex many-class classification tasks still remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose to encode the prior knowledge of a classification task into rules, then design sub-prompts according to the rules, and finally combine the sub-prompts to handle the task. We name this Prompt Tuning method with Rules “PTR”. Compared with existing prompt-based methods, PTR achieves a good trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency in building prompts. We conduct experiments on three many-class classification tasks, including relation classification, entity typing, and intent classification. The results show that PTR outperforms both vanilla and prompt tuning baselines, indicating the effectiveness of utilizing rules for prompt tuning. The source code of PTR is available at https://github.com/thunlp/PTR.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'KnowPrompt: Knowledge-aware Prompt-tuning with Synergistic Optimization for Relation Extraction', 'abstract': 'Recently, prompt-tuning has achieved promising results for specific few-shot classification tasks. The core idea of prompt-tuning is to insert text pieces (i.e., templates) into the input and transform a classification task into a masked language modeling problem. However, for relation extraction, determining an appropriate prompt template requires domain expertise, and it is cumbersome and time-consuming to obtain a suitable label word. Furthermore, there exists abundant semantic and prior knowledge among the relation labels that cannot be ignored. To this end, we focus on incorporating knowledge among relation labels into prompt-tuning for relation extraction and propose a Knowledge-aware Prompt-tuning approach with synergistic optimization (KnowPrompt). Specifically, we inject latent knowledge contained in relation labels into prompt construction with learnable virtual type words and answer words. Then, we synergistically optimize their representation with structured constraints. Extensive experimental results on five datasets with standard and low-resource settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code and datasets are available in GitHub1 for reproducibility.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Re-TACRED: Addressing Shortcomings of the TACRED Dataset', 'abstract': 'TACRED is one of the largest and most widely used sentence-level relation extraction datasets. Proposed models that are evaluated using this dataset consistently set new state-of-the-art performance. However, they still exhibit large error rates despite leveraging external knowledge and unsupervised pretraining on large text corpora. A recent study suggested that this may be due to poor dataset quality. The study observed that over 50% of the most challenging sentences from the development and test sets are incorrectly labeled and account for an average drop of 8% f1-score in model performance. However, this study was limited to a small biased sample of 5k (out of a total of 106k) sentences, substantially restricting the generalizability and broader implications of its findings. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by: (i) performing a comprehensive study over the whole TACRED dataset, (ii) proposing an improved crowdsourcing strategy and deploying it to re-annotate the whole dataset, and (iii) performing a thorough analysis to understand how correcting the TACRED annotations affects previously published results. After verification, we observed that 23.9% of TACRED labels are incorrect. Moreover, evaluating several models on our revised dataset yields an average f1-score improvement of 14.3% and helps uncover significant relationships between the different models (rather than simply offsetting or scaling their scores by a constant factor). Finally, aside from our analysis we also release Re-TACRED, a new completely re-annotated version of the TACRED dataset that can be used to perform reliable evaluation of relation extraction models.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'ChatDoctor: A Medical Chat Model Fine-Tuned on a Large Language Model Meta-AI (LLaMA) Using Medical Domain Knowledge', 'abstract': \"Objective The primary aim of this research was to address the limitations observed in the medical knowledge of prevalent large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, by creating a specialized language model with enhanced accuracy in medical advice. Methods We achieved this by adapting and refining the large language model meta-AI (LLaMA)\\xa0using a large dataset of 100,000 patient-doctor dialogues sourced from a widely used online medical consultation platform. These conversations were cleaned and anonymized to respect privacy concerns. In addition to the model refinement, we incorporated a self-directed information retrieval mechanism, allowing the model to access and utilize real-time information from online sources like Wikipedia and data from curated offline medical databases. Results The fine-tuning of the model with real-world patient-doctor interactions significantly improved the model's ability to understand patient needs and provide informed advice. By equipping the model with self-directed information retrieval from reliable online and offline sources, we observed substantial improvements in the accuracy of its responses. Conclusion Our proposed ChatDoctor, represents a significant advancement in medical LLMs, demonstrating a significant improvement in understanding patient inquiries and providing accurate advice. Given the high stakes and low error tolerance in the medical field, such enhancements in providing accurate and reliable information are not only beneficial but essential.\"}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'How Does ChatGPT Perform on the United States Medical Licensing Examination? The Implications of Large Language Models for Medical Education and Knowledge Assessment', 'abstract': \"BACKGROUND: Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a 175-billion-parameter natural language processing model that can generate conversation-style responses to user input.\\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on questions within the scope of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and Step 2 exams, as well as to analyze responses for user interpretability.\\nMETHODS: We used 2 sets of multiple-choice questions to evaluate ChatGPT's performance, each with questions pertaining to Step 1 and Step 2. The first set was derived from AMBOSS, a commonly used question bank for medical students, which also provides statistics on question difficulty and the performance on an exam relative to the user base. The second set was the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) free 120 questions. ChatGPT's performance was compared to 2 other large language models, GPT-3 and InstructGPT. The text output of each ChatGPT response was evaluated across 3 qualitative metrics: logical justification of the answer selected, presence of information internal to the question, and presence of information external to the question.\\nRESULTS: Of the 4 data sets, AMBOSS-Step1, AMBOSS-Step2, NBME-Free-Step1, and NBME-Free-Step2, ChatGPT achieved accuracies of 44% (44/100), 42% (42/100), 64.4% (56/87), and 57.8% (59/102), respectively. ChatGPT outperformed InstructGPT by 8.15% on average across all data sets, and GPT-3 performed similarly to random chance. The model demonstrated a significant decrease in performance as question difficulty increased (P=.01) within the AMBOSS-Step1 data set. We found that logical justification for ChatGPT's answer selection was present in 100% of outputs of the NBME data sets. Internal information to the question was present in 96.8% (183/189) of all questions. The presence of information external to the question was 44.5% and 27% lower for incorrect answers relative to correct answers on the NBME-Free-Step1 (P<.001) and NBME-Free-Step2 (P=.001) data sets, respectively.\\nCONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT marks a significant improvement in natural language processing models on the tasks of medical question answering. By performing at a greater than 60% threshold on the NBME-Free-Step-1 data set, we show that the model achieves the equivalent of a passing score for a third-year medical student. Additionally, we highlight ChatGPT's capacity to provide logic and informational context across the majority of answers. These facts taken together make a compelling case for the potential applications of ChatGPT as an interactive medical education tool to support learning.\"}]\n```\n\n**Part A.2: The Evolution Links (Edges of the Graph):**\nThe following list defines the citation relationships between the papers in Part A.

    "current_research_landscape": "The current research landscape centers on enhancing large language models (LLMs) for biomedical and clinical applications via domain-specific pretraining and prompt engineering techniques. This evolution has progressed from foundational biomedical language models such as BioGPT and domain-specific BERT variants, advancing towards instruction and prompt tuning methods (e.g., PTR and KnowPrompt) that incorporate prior task knowledge and label semantics for improved few-shot relation extraction and classification. Central to this is the synergy of multi-modal data integration and sophisticated AI (including retrieval mechanisms) to augment diagnostic and medical question-answering tasks. The emphasis on clinical domain knowledge, specialized language models, and information retrieval mechanisms reflects a dominant methodology of coupling knowledge-aware prompt tuning with fine-tuning of pretrained biomedical transformers. Additionally, datasets like TACRED highlight ongoing challenges and drive improvements in relation extraction performance. This trajectory is a direct response to earlier general-domain LLM limitations and the difficulties in manual prompt design, aiming to better leverage latent clinical knowledge within LLMs through structured, knowledge-informed prompt tuning and multi-modal data fusion.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internally, recent advances still face key limitations: (1) Despite improvements, models like Med-PaLM and ChatDoctor remain inferior to expert clinicians, indicating deficits in comprehension, reasoning, and domain alignment; (2) Prompt engineering methods often require substantial expert effort or rely on heuristic rules, limiting scalability and adaptability across biomedical subdomains; (3) Existing datasets, including TACRED, suffer from annotation noise and restricted domain coverage, impeding reliable model evaluation and inducing model errors; (4) Integration of multi-modal biomedical data with language models is underexplored, particularly in few-shot and prompt-tuning contexts, limiting model richness and grounding. Externally, global context analysis suggests novel connections have been underutilized: (a) The linkage between state-of-the-art BLEU scores (a strong measure in text generation) and multi-modal data or retrieval mechanisms is insufficiently leveraged to optimize biomedical language generation and report synthesis; (b) Cross-modal and cross-source retrieval systems incorporating privacy-preserving mechanisms remain largely unexplored in biomedical LLMs; (c) Techniques from computational linguistics and transfer learning focused on relation extraction and entity recognition could potentiate improvements if combined with prompt tuning but have not been fully integrated; (d) The interplay between knowledge graph-based retrieval and prompt-based learning represents a promising but underdeveloped research frontier.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "(1) Multi-Modal Knowledge-Infused Prompt Optimization: Develop prompt engineering frameworks that dynamically incorporate heterogeneous biomedical modalities (text, imaging, signals) via cross-modal retrieval and fusion modules to enrich prompt contexts, leveraging global advances in multi-modal neural machine translation and alignment. This addresses internal gaps in multimodal integration and external gaps on multi-modal BLEU score leveraging in biomedical generation tasks. (2) Scalable Knowledge Graph-Enabled Prompt Tuning with Automated Rule Induction: Integrate structured biomedical knowledge graphs within prompt tuning to automatically generate and optimize prompts and label words without heavy manual effort, combining strengths of PTR and KnowPrompt with retrieval-augmented generation and graph embedding methods. This tackles manual prompt design challenges and harnesses underexploited knowledge graph retrieval methods. (3) Benchmarking and Dataset Revitalization with Privacy-Preserving Data Augmentation: Revise and expand biomedical relation extraction and question-answering datasets (e.g., TACRED) incorporating multi-source annotations, denoising strategies, and privacy-aware synthetic data generation informed by state-of-the-art data management and retrieval research. This would mitigate dataset quality limitations and enable rigorous evaluation and training pipelines for knowledge-aware few-shot LLM adaptation in clinical settings."
