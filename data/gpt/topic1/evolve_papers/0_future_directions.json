        "title": "Adaptive Conversational RAG with Memory-Augmented Contextual Retrieval",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current RAG systems struggle with conversational dependencies and maintaining contextual coherence over multi-turn dialogues, especially handling coreference and pragmatic reasoning, leading to suboptimal response quality in conversational QA.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical internal gap related to conversational and multi-turn QA limitations, by leveraging the high-potential opportunity of integrating memory-augmented dialogue understanding and dynamic retrieval guided by user interaction histories, thus enhancing domain adaptation and coherence.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive RAG architecture that embeds a long-term conversational memory module interfacing with a retrieval system dynamically conditioned on dialogue context and aggregate user intent. The retriever will be fine-tuned jointly with the generator using multi-turn conversational datasets enriched with clickthrough feedback. The memory module will cache salient dialogue states and retrieved documents, enabling context propagation and pragmatic reasoning. Retrieval prompts will be dynamically constructed using both recent turns and aggregate user query profiles, enabling contextually adaptive retrieval and generation in a closed loop.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multi-turn conversational QA datasets (CoQA, QuAC), supplemented with synthetic aggregate query clusters. 2. Integrate and fine-tune a semantic retriever (ColBERT variants) with a transformer-based generator (e.g., T5 or GPT) in an end-to-end manner, incorporating a memory-augmented module. 3. Incorporate clickthrough data simulation or crowdsource relevance feedback as supervision signals for adaptive retrieval. 4. Evaluate on conversational QA benchmarks measuring accuracy, F1, coreference resolution scores, and pragmatic reasoning metrics. 5. Conduct ablations on memory size, retrieval prompt design, and user history incorporation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multi-turn conversation: User: \"Who won the Ballon d'Or in 2020?\" System retrieves related sports news. User: \"Has he won it before?\" Expected Output: System retrieves past award winners maintaining coreference to 'he', answering accurately that Robert Lewandowski was considered but the award was cancelled in 2020, showing pragmatic reasoning linked with previous turns.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If integration of memory module causes latency or convergence issues, fallback to hierarchical dialogue context windows with attention re-weighting on retrieved documents. Alternatively, separate retriever and generator fine-tuning, then pipeline integration. Analyze failure points via case studies focusing on coreference and noisiness in retrieval."

        "title": "Retrieval Noise Injection for Robust LLM Generation via Noise-Aware Prompt Engineering",
        "Problem_Statement": "Non-relevant or random documents were unexpectedly found to improve LLM generation accuracy, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood, limiting the ability to purposefully exploit retrieval noise.",
        "Motivation": "This targets the critical external conceptual gap regarding the role of retrieval noise in improving generation robustness. By systematizing noise-aware retrieval prompt design and joint training, this research builds a theoretical and practical foundation to harness beneficial noise patterns.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a noise injection framework for RAG where controlled stochastic perturbations to retrieval inputs (random, semi-random, context-shifted documents) are combined with specialized noise-aware prompting strategies for the generator. Implement a joint training regime where the retriever learns to balance true relevance and structured noise, while the generator is trained to leverage contextual diversity induced by noise to improve factuality and reduce hallucinations. Visualization and interpretability tools will analyze how noise affects attention and generation pathways.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use standard QA datasets (Natural Questions, TriviaQA) as baseline. 2. Implement noise injection strategies: purely random retrieval, context-drifted vs. semantically related noise. 3. Train noise-aware prompts for GPT-based generations under varying noise conditions. 4. Perform controlled experiments comparing end-to-end joint training with independent retriever/generator training. 5. Evaluate with metrics for accuracy, hallucination rates, and factual consistency. 6. Conduct ablation on noise levels and document types.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Question: 'Who is the CEO of Tesla?' Retrieval set injected with a mixture of relevant Tesla news articles plus random unrelated sport articles. Expected Output: Despite noise, the generator reliably outputs 'Elon Musk' due to learned robustness and noise-informed prompt design.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If noise injection disrupts generation quality, revert to soft noise schedules with gradual introduction, or incorporate denoising modules. Alternatively, explore hybrid deterministic and stochastic retrieval fusion with generator ensembles to enhance robustness."

        "Problem_Statement": "RAG systems lack robust domain adaptation and operational reliability since they do not sufficiently leverage real-world interaction signals like clickthrough data for dynamic relevance feedback and continual learning.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the external gap of integrating clickthrough data with latent semantic retrieval, this research blends crowd interaction signals and user feedback into RAG training loops for enhanced domain adaptation and system robustness, going beyond static latent semantic models.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create a feedback-augmented RAG framework where live user interaction signals—clickthroughs, dwell time, explicit feedback—are used to dynamically update latent semantic embeddings in the retriever via online learning. The retriever and generator jointly adapt to emerging domains, with crowdsourcing pipelines enabling correction of errors. This method will introduce a hybrid offline-online training paradigm, exploiting continuous relevance refinement and user expectation modeling. Novel clickthrough-aware loss functions will modulate retrieval ranking during training.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Gather datasets with associated click logs (e.g., MS MARCO with clickthrough data). 2. Develop latent semantic retriever fine-tuned on click-guided relevance judgments. 3. Implement online learning modules to update retriever embeddings with live simulated user interactions. 4. Fine-tune generator jointly with retriever adaptively updating for domain shifts. 5. Measure domain adaptation success on specialized datasets (healthcare, finance) with user feedback simulations. 6. Evaluate improvements in retrieval precision, generation factuality, and user satisfaction proxies.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User queries medical information, clicks on retrieved documents about 'diabetes symptoms'. The system updates embedding weights to better prioritize similar health-related documents for future queries. Expected Output: Subsequent responses better grounded in verified medical knowledge, with reduced hallucinations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If online learning proves unstable, introduce mini-batch update regimes with validation checkpoints. Alternatively, simulate batch re-training with synthetic clickthrough expansion. Employ active learning with human-in-the-loop validation as a safety net."

        "title": "Neuro-Cognitive Inspired Hybrid Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation in RAG Systems",
        "Problem_Statement": "Hallucination remains a persistent challenge in RAG-enhanced LLMs, partly due to suboptimal decoding strategies that insufficiently integrate external knowledge and internal memory.",
        "Motivation": "Bridging internal gaps around hallucination and external gaps in leveraging neuro-cognitive insights offers a novel hybrid decoding approach that fuses cognitive-inspired memory retrieval with probabilistic decoding, mitigating hallucinations via deep integration of knowledge and memory.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid decoding algorithm inspired by cognitive memory retrieval mechanisms combining fast pattern completion (parallel retrieval) and slow confirmation (sequential verification) processes. This decoder dynamically balances reliance on retrieved documents and internal language priors by directing attention through a neuro-inspired gating system. The approach integrates entity embeddings and semantic memory modules and introduces feedback-driven adjustments from external knowledge confidence scores during generation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Implement baseline RAG with standard beam search on QA benchmarks. 2. Develop the hybrid decoder incorporating cognitive gating and memory modeling modules. 3. Integrate entity embeddings and knowledge confidence metrics. 4. Evaluate hallucination prevalence, factual accuracy, and fluency across multiple datasets including conversational QA. 5. Run user studies to assess perceived answer reliability. 6. Perform ablation on gating mechanisms and memory module implementations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Question about 'historic achievements of Marie Curie'. Expected Output: Answers accurately grounded on retrieved documents without fabricating achievements, showing improved hallucination mitigation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If hybrid decoding complexity causes latency or convergence issues, fallback to modular post-generation hallucination detection with fact verification filters. Alternatively, employ probabilistic ensembles to mimic hybrid decoding benefits."

        "Problem_Statement": "Current RAG systems primarily focus on textual knowledge and often ignore multi-modal sources (images, tables, graphs), limiting contextualization in domains like healthcare or scientific literature where knowledge is multi-modal.",
        "Motivation": "This idea exploits the external gap of cross-disciplinary advances by integrating heterogeneous knowledge representations and retrieval across multiple modalities, enhancing LLM contextualization well beyond traditional semantic text retrieval.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a unified multi-modal retrieval-augmentation framework where textual, visual, and structured knowledge embeddings co-exist in a shared latent space. Develop cross-modal retriever architectures capable of multimodal query reformulation, and design generator conditioning mechanisms that fuse multi-modal retrieved information seamlessly. Specialized domain adapters will enable dynamic weighting and attention over modalities based on conversational context and query type.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multi-modal datasets combining text, images, and tables (e.g., medical reports with scans, scientific papers with figures). 2. Train multi-modal retrievers jointly with adapters for domain specialization. 3. Extend LLM input conditioning layers for heterogeneous modalities. 4. Benchmark on specialized multimodal QA datasets and measure improvements in accuracy, relevance, and hallucination reduction. 5. Analyze modality contribution per query type.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Query about 'interpretation of chest X-ray abnormalities in COVID-19'. Expected Output: Generator produces a contextualized, accurate explanation referencing both textual guidelines and visual scan retrievals fused in the response.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-modal integration proves too complex or data-starved, focus on dual-modality (text plus tables) first and progressively incorporate images. Alternatively, rely on modality-specific retrieval cascades with late fusion in generation."

        "Problem_Statement": "Conversational QA systems exhibit poor coreference resolution, affecting context understanding and retrieval relevance in multi-turn settings, and existing retrieval models do not utilize user interaction signals like clicks to improve this.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing critical internal gaps in coreference and pragmatic reasoning and external underuse of clickthrough data, this work proposes click-driven adaptive retrieval models that enhance coreference resolution dynamically in dialogues.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a retrieval module that integrates coreference-aware latent semantic embeddings updated via implicit user clicks indicating reference correctness or error. The system will use these signals to adapt embedding spaces emphasizing correct entity linking and pragmatic context. Jointly train retriever and generator to reinforce coreference understanding, enabling more precise retrieval of contextually appropriate documents in multi-turn dialogues.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use conversational QA datasets with annotated coreference chains (CoQA). 2. Collect or simulate clickthrough signals aligned to coreference correctness. 3.

Federated aggregation securely blends gradients or model updates centrally without accessing raw data. Incorporate differential privacy mechanisms and communication-efficient protocols. The aggregated model will support domain-adaptive, privacy-compliant retrieval enhancements for downstream generation.",
