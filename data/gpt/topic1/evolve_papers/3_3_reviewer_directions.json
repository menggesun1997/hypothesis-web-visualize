    "title": "Proxy-Aware Knowledge Injection to Correct Systemic Biases in Clinical Prediction Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Dependence on flawed proxies like healthcare costs results in perpetuation of systemic biases in clinical prediction models that standard debiasing techniques fail to fully mitigate.",
    "Motivation": "Targets critical internal gap on proxy-driven biases and novel external insight about leveraging linguistic and semantic knowledge bases to detect and neutralize proxy effects, pushing beyond incremental correction to proxy-aware model architectures.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a proxy-aware knowledge injection framework wherein domain-specific knowledge bases encoding the relationships between proxies (e.g., cost) and vulnerable group disparities dynamically influence training loss penalties. This system identifies proxy variables via semantic query of language corpora and health ontologies, then constrains model learning to reduce reliance on such proxies via structured counterfactual augmentation and causal regularization.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Identify proxy variables and encode proxy relationships from health and fairness knowledge graphs. 2) Train clinical prediction models on standard datasets (e.g., MIMIC) augmented with counterfactual samples representing proxy-neutral scenarios. 3) Implement causal regularization terms guided by proxy knowledge. 4) Evaluate fairness via multiple protected attribute metrics, predictive accuracy, and proxy sensitivity. 5) Benchmark against baseline debiasing approaches ignoring proxies explicitly.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Predict hospital readmission where cost correlates with race. Expected output: Model predictions neutralized for cost proxy influence with reduced racial performance disparity as evidenced through fairness metrics.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "When proxy identification is noisy or incomplete, incorporate human-in-the-loop proxy validation and semi-supervised learning to iteratively refine proxy variable sets and constraints."

The description would benefit from a clearer exposition on how dynamic influence is quantified and applied during model training, particularly clarifying the interplay between the knowledge-guided proxy detection, counterfactual augmentation, and causal regularization components to assure internal coherence and reproducibility. Explicit modeling assumptions and data requirements should be detailed to validate the approach’s conceptual soundness and clarify potential limitations or boundary conditions of the method’s applicability within clinical settings reliant on diverse, noisy healthcare data sources. This will solidify confidence in the method’s feasibility and correctness of design prior to extensive empirical validation phases, enhancing overall soundness and methodological transparency in a complex setting involving intertwined proxies and fairness constraints, especially given the foundational dependence on semantic and causal knowledge integration techniques that remain challenging in practice. Targeted clarifications will strengthen reviewers’ comprehension of the method’s novelty and operational flow, facilitating constructive critique and downstream adoption by practitioners seeking bias-mitigated clinical prediction models tailored to societal fairness demands embedded in clinical workflows and compliance standards-hence deserving priority in revision efforts to mitigate risks of conceptual ambiguities or implementation gaps before resource-intensive experimentation begins.\"},\"target_section\":\"Proposed_Method\"},{"

          "feedback_content": "Considering the novelty has been assessed as NOV-COMPETITIVE due to strong existing links between core components, the proposal can significantly enhance impact and distinctiveness by explicitly incorporating Explainable AI (XAI) techniques from the globally-linked concepts, to not only mitigate proxy biases but also provide interpretable justifications for bias corrections. Integrating explainability could address clinical stakeholders’ needs for transparent decision-making, facilitating trust and practical deployment of bias-corrected models in healthcare settings. Additionally, leveraging information retrieval methods to refine semantic proxy queries or guide counterfactual augmentation could improve proxy detection precision and augment model robustness. Exploring computational political science concepts might also help illuminate systemic sociotechnical factors influencing proxy relationships, enriching the knowledge injection framework with sociopolitical contextualization. These interdisciplinary enhancements would not only broaden the idea’s scope and applicability but also deepen its innovation, potentially offsetting the competitive novelty status and contributing broadly to AI fairness research beyond clinical prediction models. Incorporating one or more of these suggested globally-linked concepts could strengthen submission originality and multiplier impact in high-tier venues targeting novel fairness-aware AI methods.\" ,\"target_section\":\"Proposed_Method\"}]}"
