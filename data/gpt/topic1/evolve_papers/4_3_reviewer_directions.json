    "title": "Lifelong Learning Memory Banks for LLMs Using Dynamic Protein Knowledge Graphs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM-based protein reasoning systems lack mechanisms for lifelong learning supported by continuously updated, dynamic protein knowledge graphs that enable persistent, incremental knowledge acquisition and reasoning.",
    "Motivation": "Bridges the internal-external gap by proposing a novel dynamic protein knowledge graph integrated memory bank that allows LLMs to perform efficient long-term reasoning through persistent graph-memory updates and queries.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a dynamic knowledge graph representing proteins, structures, and functional annotations with real-time update capabilities. Develop LLM memory bank modules that operate as graph query engines, capable of incremental learning through graph expansion and node embedding updates, facilitating efficient lifelong reasoning over biological knowledge.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble dynamic protein knowledge graphs using UniProt and RoseTTAFold data streams. 2. Integrate graph embedding layers with LLM memory modules. 3. Implement incremental graph update algorithms simulating new biological discoveries. 4. Evaluate models on temporal reasoning benchmarks and novel protein function prediction. 5. Compare performance against static memory and non-graph memory baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: New protein functional interaction data not present in initial training; Task: Reason about protein function changes and hypothesize impacts. Output: LLM integrates new graph nodes/edges into memory, adaptively improves prediction accuracy on evolving protein functions.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If graph-memory integration is challenging, fallback includes using attention-based retrieval over stored vector databases indexing graph embeddings for approximate retrieval and reasoning."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines integrating dynamic protein knowledge graphs with LLM memory banks via graph query engines and incremental node embedding updates. However, the mechanism is currently underspecified regarding how the LLM interfaces with the graph memory bank dynamically and how updates propagate to influence reasoning without retraining the entire model. Clarify the exact interaction protocols, update frequencies, and methods for embedding synchronization to ensure the system's soundness and reproducibility. Including a schematic or algorithmic framework would strengthen confidence in the mechanism's viability and innovativeness. This clarity is essential as the core novelty hinges on seamless lifelong learning integration of LLMs with evolving biological graphs, which is non-trivial and not straightforward from the current description. Please elaborate in the Proposed_Method section with technical rigor and detail, perhaps referencing existing incremental learning or graph integration paradigms as a baseline for comparison and distinction."

For instance, incorporating human nutrition-related protein functional annotations or clinical protein data streams from such institutions could broaden the scope and applicability of the protein knowledge graph beyond structural biology, introducing translational or clinical relevance. This integration could be introduced as an additional experiment or case study illustrating the system's adaptability to diverse biological datasets and real-world biomedical challenges, thereby increasing the systemâ€™s novelty and potential impact on global health and nutritional research communities."
