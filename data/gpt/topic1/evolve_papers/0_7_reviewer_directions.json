    "title": "Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Domain Adaptation in RAG Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Deploying RAG with domain adaptation often requires sensitive user data (click logs, queries), raising privacy concerns and hindering broad adoption in domains like healthcare and finance.",
    "Motivation": "This idea tackles critical external gaps involving user data and domain adaptation by proposing a federated learning framework enabling multi-institutional collaborative RAG adaptation without data leakage, thus preserving privacy while leveraging real-world feedback.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a federated RAG training pipeline where individual client nodes fine-tune their retriever-generator locally using internal data and interaction signals. Federated aggregation securely blends gradients or model updates centrally without accessing raw data. Incorporate differential privacy mechanisms and communication-efficient protocols. The aggregated model will support domain-adaptive, privacy-compliant retrieval enhancements for downstream generation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Simulate federated environments with multiple healthcare or finance clients, each with proprietary data and click logs. 2. Implement federated training algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx) on retriever-generator modules. 3. Measure privacy metrics, communication overhead, and domain adaptation gains. 4. Benchmark model performance against centrally trained baselines. 5. Conduct privacy attack simulations to verify compliance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Institution A queries patient records; Institution B queries financial documents. Federated updates improve each local RAG model's adaptation without sharing raw queries or clicks. Expected Output: Enhanced retrieval relevance and generation accuracy respecting privacy constraints.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated convergence is slow or unstable, introduce personalization layers and hybrid centralized-federated schemes. Alternatively, deploy synthetic data augmentation offline."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a high-level federated learning framework integrating differential privacy and communication efficiency, but lacks detailed mechanism descriptions critical for reproducibility and evaluation. For example, it is unclear how retriever-generator modules are locally fine-tuned in federated settings, which specific differential privacy techniques and parameters will be used, and how communication-efficient protocols are concretely applied given the complexity of RAG components. The method should clarify the architecture adjustments for federated aggregation, privacy budget accounting, and robustness to client heterogeneity to ensure conceptual soundness and practical implementation feasibility. Addressing these would strengthen the methodological clarity and rigor substantially, providing confidence in the approach's validity and distinguishing it from existing federated domain adaptation works with privacy constraints in NLP-like settings. This critique targets the 'Proposed_Method' section specifically to request comprehensive elaboration on model update mechanisms, privacy integration, and communication protocol design tailored to RAG systems in federated learning settings, beyond broad-stroke descriptions currently presented."

          "feedback_content": "While the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a logical progression of simulation, algorithm implementation, and evaluation metrics relevant to federated learning and privacy, it does not elaborate on critical experimental design specifics needed to assess feasibility thoroughly. Key missing details include: definition and sourcing of realistic heterogeneous client datasets with domain shift and privacy constraints; baseline selection and metric justification beyond accuracy to quantify privacy-utility tradeoffs; experimental controls to isolate effects of federated algorithms vs. personalization layers from fallback options; and concrete methodology for privacy attack simulations including threat models and attack vectors. Including plans for federated system runtime profiling and scalability with realistic communication constraints would further improve feasibility assessment. Strengthening these experiment plan components, especially dataset realism, privacy benchmarks, and fallback evaluation metrics, is necessary to ensure scientific soundness and reproducibility. This feedback is targeted at the 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' to encourage detailed, pragmatic experimental planning that realistically tests both domain adaptation gains and privacy guarantees in federated RAG research."
