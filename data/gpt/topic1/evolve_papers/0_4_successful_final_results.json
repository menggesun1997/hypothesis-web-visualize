    "title": "Dynamic Aggregation of Multi-Modal Knowledge for Contextualized RAG in Specialized Domains",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current RAG systems primarily focus on textual knowledge and often ignore multi-modal sources (images, tables, graphs), limiting contextualization in domains like healthcare or scientific literature where knowledge is multi-modal.",
    "Motivation": "This idea exploits the external gap of cross-disciplinary advances by integrating heterogeneous knowledge representations and retrieval across multiple modalities, enhancing LLM contextualization well beyond traditional semantic text retrieval.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a unified multi-modal retrieval-augmentation framework where textual, visual, and structured knowledge embeddings co-exist in a shared latent space. Develop cross-modal retriever architectures capable of multimodal query reformulation, and design generator conditioning mechanisms that fuse multi-modal retrieved information seamlessly. Specialized domain adapters will enable dynamic weighting and attention over modalities based on conversational context and query type.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multi-modal datasets combining text, images, and tables (e.g., medical reports with scans, scientific papers with figures). 2. Train multi-modal retrievers jointly with adapters for domain specialization. 3. Extend LLM input conditioning layers for heterogeneous modalities. 4. Benchmark on specialized multimodal QA datasets and measure improvements in accuracy, relevance, and hallucination reduction. 5. Analyze modality contribution per query type.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Query about 'interpretation of chest X-ray abnormalities in COVID-19'. Expected Output: Generator produces a contextualized, accurate explanation referencing both textual guidelines and visual scan retrievals fused in the response.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-modal integration proves too complex or data-starved, focus on dual-modality (text plus tables) first and progressively incorporate images. Alternatively, rely on modality-specific retrieval cascades with late fusion in generation."

        "title": "Adaptive Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation Leveraging Process Mining and Knowledge Management for Specialized Domains",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems predominantly utilize textual knowledge and lack sophisticated mechanisms for integrating heterogeneous multi-modal data (images, tables, graphs) especially in specialized domains like healthcare and scientific literature. This limitation reduces contextual accuracy and fails to adapt retrieval and fusion strategies to dynamic user workflows and domain-specific information needs.",
        "Motivation": "While existing multi-modal RAG approaches enhance LLM contextualization by combining various data modalities, they often suffer from insufficient architectural clarity and adaptability, limiting practical impact and replicability. This proposal advances the state-of-the-art by explicitly incorporating process mining and knowledge management techniques to dynamically model user interaction workflows and optimize multi-modal retrieval pipelines. This synergy fosters a novel adaptive framework that not only unifies heterogeneous knowledge representations via informed architectural mechanisms but also continuously tailors retrieval and generation strategies based on evolving user context and domain workflows, thereby elevating relevance, precision, and reducing hallucination risks in specialized domains.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular, adaptive multi-modal RAG framework underpinned by:\n\n1. **Detailed Architecture for Cross-Modal Query Reformulation and Fusion**: \n   - Develop modality-specific encoders (textual, visual, tabular) mapping inputs into a **shared latent embedding space** using contrastive learning techniques to ensure alignment and semantic coherence across modalities. \n   - Integrate a **multi-head cross-modal retriever module** that reformulates queries by attending jointly over multimodal embeddings, applying a hybrid early-late fusion strategy: early fusion through learned joint embeddings for semantically aligned data, and late fusion using modality-specific relevance scores for heterogeneous data.\n   - Implement **generator conditioning layers** that fuse multi-modal retrieved evidence via a dynamic attention mechanism weighted by domain adapter outputs, enabling responsive focus over modalities per query.\n\n2. **Domain Adapters with Dynamic Weighting Based on Conversational Context**:\n   - Embed lightweight domain adapters into retriever and generator networks that calibrate modality importance using contextual cues (e.g., query type, user interaction history).\n   - Use attention-based mechanisms within adapters to compute modality weights, enabling dynamic modulation of retrieval and generation behaviors.\n\n3. **Process Mining for Adaptive Workflow Modeling**:\n   - Leverage process mining algorithms on user interaction logs and retrieval sequences to discover retrieval patterns and domain workflows.\n   - Integrate a **workflow-aware AI agent** that uses mined process models to dynamically orchestrate retrieval modalities and adjust query reformulation strategies in real-time, adapting to user behavior and domain-specific knowledge demands.\n\n4. **Knowledge Management for Structured Multi-Modal Curation**:\n   - Utilize knowledge management principles to structure, index, and curate heterogeneous knowledge artifacts, improving retrieval precision and consistency.\n   - Implement a knowledge base schema supporting multi-modal entity linking and provenance tracking to minimize hallucinations.\n\nThe entire pipeline is diagrammed with data flow stages: user query → multi-modal encoder ensemble → cross-modal retriever with adaptive query reformulation → AI agent-informed modality orchestration → generator conditioning with domain adapter-based dynamic fusion → output generation. Detailed algorithmic outlines for embedding alignment, attention weighting, and process mining integration will be provided to ensure reproducibility and clarity.\n\nThis approach distinguishes itself through its explicit architectural transparency, integration of process mining for adaptive behavior, and knowledge management for curated multi-modal information, collectively surpassing existing multi-modal RAG techniques in adaptability, contextual precision, and domain specialization.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate and synthesize multi-modal datasets combining text, images, tables, and graphs relevant to specialized domains (e.g., annotated medical reports with imaging and tabular data, scientific papers with figures and structured data).\n2. Develop modality-specific encoders and jointly train them with contrastive losses to produce aligned shared embeddings.\n3. Implement and test the proposed cross-modal retriever architecture with hybrid fusion strategies, validating query reformulation efficacy.\n4. Integrate domain adapters into retriever and generator models and train them to learn dynamic weighting per conversational context.\n5. Apply process mining techniques on simulated and real user interaction logs to learn retrieval workflows; develop AI agents that leverage these workflows to adapt retrieval strategies.\n6. Construct a knowledge management schema and integrate it with the retrieval system to enhance curation and provenance awareness.\n7. Benchmark the full system on specialized multi-modal QA datasets measuring accuracy, retrieval relevance, hallucination rates, and adaptability across query types.\n8. Conduct ablation studies isolating impacts of process mining integration, domain adapters, and knowledge management.\n9. Qualitatively analyze modality contribution and retrieval workflow adaptations per user session.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input Query: 'Interpret the progression of chest X-ray imaging abnormalities in COVID-19 patients alongside lab results and clinical notes.'\nExpected Output: A precisely contextualized explanation synthesizing textual clinical guidelines, structured lab data, and relevant visual evidence from retrieved chest X-ray images. The system dynamically determines the emphasis on visual versus tabular data based on query intent, referencing provenance and workflow-informed retrieval rationale to enhance trustworthiness.\n\nInput Query: 'Explain the functional relationship between protein structures depicted in scientific figures and corresponding experimental data tables.'\nExpected Output: A coherent multi-modal response integrating visual data from figures with tabular experimental results, generated via architecture that dynamically fuses modalities guided by domain-adapter attention, reflecting learned domain workflows for molecular biology literature.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full multi-modal integration with dynamic process mining proves infeasible, incrementally scale complexity starting with dual-modality scenarios (text and tabular data) coupled with static domain adapters. Gradually integrate process mining components by first modeling simple user workflows offline before attempting real-time AI agent orchestration. Additionally, if modality fusion becomes prohibitively complex, implement modality-specific retrieval cascades with late fusion during generation as an intermediate step, maintaining knowledge management-based curation to preserve precision and reduce hallucination risks."

Further, mechanisms for dynamic weighting and attention based on conversational context are mentioned but not well-specified, leaving some uncertainty about implementation feasibility and soundness of the core method. Providing architectural diagrams or algorithmic outlines would significantly strengthen the soundness and clarity of the proposed method section to reassure reviewers that the approach is sufficiently concrete and well-grounded technically. Consider detailing how embeddings from different modalities will be aligned, how late fusion versus joint embedding strategies will be balanced, and how domain adapters will be integrated into the overall pipeline explicitly to improve soundness and replicability of this novel integration approach (Proposed_Method)."

Specifically, incorporating process mining techniques to dynamically model and adapt to user interaction workflows or domain-specific information retrieval patterns could tailor the multi-modal retrieval aggregator more effectively, improving contextualization over time. Additionally, leveraging knowledge management approaches to structure and curate heterogeneous knowledge from different modalities might improve retrieval precision and reduce hallucination. Exploring synergy with AI agents that orchestrate retrieval modalities dynamically based on query characteristics and user context could further elevate the practical impact and novelty of the system. This global integration could help differentiate the system from existing multi-modal RAG approaches and open new avenues for adaptive, real-time, domain-specialized knowledge augmentation (Globally-Linked Concepts)."
