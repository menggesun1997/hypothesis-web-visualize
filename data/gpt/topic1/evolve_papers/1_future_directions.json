        "title": "Trust-Calibrated Human-in-the-Loop Adaptive Fine-Tuning for Domain-Specific LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current domain-specific LLM fine-tuning lacks dynamic trust calibration and interpretability, leading to user mistrust in high-stakes domains and suboptimal decision support.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient calibration and interpretability limiting trust, and leverages the high-potential opportunity of human expert-in-the-loop feedback combined with probabilistic calibration.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an interactive fine-tuning framework where domain experts provide real-time feedback on LLM outputs via an interface. Integrate Bayesian calibration layers to adjust LLM confidence scores based on cumulative expert corrections. Use uncertainty-aware prompt tuning coupled with explainable intermediate representations to improve interpretability. This dynamic feedback loop refines both knowledge embeddings and prompt parameters, achieving calibrated and trustworthy outputs.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect domain-specific datasets from healthcare or finance with expert annotations. 2) Implement baseline LLM fine-tuning and confidence calibration methods. 3) Develop a human-in-the-loop interface for expert feedback collection. 4) Train the Bayesian calibration layer combined with uncertainty-aware prompt tuning. 5) Evaluate trust calibration metrics (ECE, Brier score), task accuracy, and user trust surveys. 6) Compare against fixed fine-tuning baselines without feedback.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical note asks \"What is the likelihood of patient readmission within 30 days?\" Expected output: Model predicts risk with calibrated confidence intervals and highlights the reasoning steps supported by clinical features. Expert feedback adjusts confidence and explanation iteratively for improvement.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If Bayesian calibration underperforms, explore ensemble neural calibration methods or conformal prediction-based trust bounds. If expert feedback is sparse, simulate feedback with curated corrections or leverage active learning to prioritize uncertain cases."

        "title": "Graph Neural Network-Guided Prompt Engineering for Knowledge Base-Integrated LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Manual prompt engineering for integrating knowledge graphs into LLMs is cumbersome and insufficiently captures structured global knowledge, limiting domain expertise encoding.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap of manual and imperfect prompt engineering and the lack of structured global knowledge integration by using graph neural networks to automate prompt construction synergistically with knowledge base embeddings.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a GNN module to analyze the subgraph of a domain-specific knowledge base relevant to the input. This GNN outputs semantic and relational context vectors that guide an adaptive prompt generator module, which constructs context-rich prompt templates. Coupled with fine-tuned knowledge embeddings, this dynamically crafted prompt improves relation extraction and QA performance by better capturing global semantics and structural dependencies.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Use biomedical or legal KB datasets with entity and relation annotations. 2) Build baseline models using static prompt templates with embeddings. 3) Implement GNN architectures (GCN, GraphSAGE) to encode KB subgraphs. 4) Train prompt generator via reinforcement learning to maximize downstream task accuracy. 5) Evaluate on relation extraction, QA tasks using precision/recall/F1, and ablate prompt types.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Question \"What drugs interact with Warfarin?\" with a medical KB subgraph. Expected output: GNN-enhanced prompt captures interaction relations, producing accurate, contextually enriched answers listing relevant drugs with supporting evidence.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If GNN-guided prompts fail to improve, test simpler attention-based KB encodings or rule-based prompt augmentation. Alternatively, incorporate human expert feedback to refine prompt templates."

        "Problem_Statement": "Existing approaches insufficiently leverage multimodal data (text, images, graphs) from e-commerce and supply chains, limiting the richness of domain-specific LLM fine-tuning.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap of underexplored multimodal and cross-domain knowledge fusion for LLM fine-tuning, particularly the overlooked intersections in e-commerce and supply chain data.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multimodal embedding framework that fuses textual product descriptions, user behavior analytics, supply chain graphs, and product images into unified knowledge representations. Integrate these into LLM prompt-tuning pipelines via modality-aware adapters. Employ contrastive learning between modalities to reinforce semantic alignment and enable richer domain understanding for tasks like demand forecasting and product classification.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble multimodal datasets from e-commerce platforms comprising text, images, and graph-structured supply chain info. 2) Construct baseline mono-modal LLM fine-tuned models. 3) Develop modality encoders and fusion mechanisms within adapters. 4) Perform contrastive pretraining to align modalities. 5) Fine-tune for downstream classification and forecasting tasks. 6) Evaluate accuracy, F1, and modality contribution ablations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Product listing with description, image, and supply chain node info. Expected output: Accurate classification of product category and prediction of stock shortage risk, supported by multimodal evidence.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If fusion models underperform, try sequential modality incorporation or prioritize stronger modality encoders. Use data augmentation or synthetic multimodal examples to enrich training."

        "Motivation": "Directly addresses the critical external gap of bridging domain expert interactions, real-time feedback, and trust calibration to improve reliability in practical settings.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Build a continuous deployment system where domain experts interact with LLM outputs, providing trust ratings and corrections. Use these signals to update Bayesian trust calibration models and fine-tune embeddings incrementally without full retraining, enabling ephemeral prompt adjustments. Incorporate causal inference to model the effect of feedback on user trust and prediction accuracy dynamically.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select a high-stakes domain (e.g., legal document review). 2) Deploy a prototype LLM with initial fine-tuning. 3) Collect domain expert interactions and trust feedback during real usage. 4) Implement incremental calibration and embedding fine-tuning modules. 5) Analyze trust metric improvements, prediction accuracy over time, and human satisfaction.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Legal query raised by a paralegal with LLM answer and associated confidence. Expected output: Expert flags low trust and suggests correction; model updates confidence calibration and embeddings accordingly to improve future outputs.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If incremental updates cause model drift, implement regularization techniques and fallback to batch retraining triggered by feedback accumulation thresholds."
