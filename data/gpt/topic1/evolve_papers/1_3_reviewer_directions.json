    "title": "Real-time Trust Feedback Loop for Continuous LLM Calibration in High-Stakes Domains",
    "Problem_Statement": "No large-scale systems integrate real-time domain expert feedback for continuous trust calibration and model refinement during LLM deployment.",
    "Motivation": "Directly addresses the critical external gap of bridging domain expert interactions, real-time feedback, and trust calibration to improve reliability in practical settings.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a continuous deployment system where domain experts interact with LLM outputs, providing trust ratings and corrections. Use these signals to update Bayesian trust calibration models and fine-tune embeddings incrementally without full retraining, enabling ephemeral prompt adjustments. Incorporate causal inference to model the effect of feedback on user trust and prediction accuracy dynamically.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select a high-stakes domain (e.g., legal document review). 2) Deploy a prototype LLM with initial fine-tuning. 3) Collect domain expert interactions and trust feedback during real usage. 4) Implement incremental calibration and embedding fine-tuning modules. 5) Analyze trust metric improvements, prediction accuracy over time, and human satisfaction.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Legal query raised by a paralegal with LLM answer and associated confidence. Expected output: Expert flags low trust and suggests correction; model updates confidence calibration and embeddings accordingly to improve future outputs.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If incremental updates cause model drift, implement regularization techniques and fallback to batch retraining triggered by feedback accumulation thresholds."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is conceptually sound but lacks details on critical aspects that can significantly affect practical feasibility. Specifically, it omits how domain expertsâ€™ trust ratings and corrections will be standardized or quantified to update the Bayesian calibration models and embeddings incrementally without destabilizing the LLM. There is also no clear methodology described for causal inference modeling of feedback impacts, which is non-trivial and may require longitudinal data and careful confounder control. It would strengthen the feasibility if the authors elaborate on mechanisms for expert feedback collection interfaces, data volume requirements, timing and frequency of incremental updates, and criteria for triggering fallback batch retraining to prevent model drift. Adding pilot studies or simulations addressing these points before full deployment would enhance confidence in scientific rigor and operational viability of the experiment plan. This would considerably reduce execution risk in a high-stakes domain like legal review where errors are costly and expert time limited, thus ensuring the deployment pipeline is robust and actionable in practice, not just theoretically appealing.\" , \"target_section\":\"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\""

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the focus on trust calibration in domain-specific LLM deployment, the work's impact and uniqueness could be substantially enhanced by integrating concepts from related fields like clinical decision support systems or intelligent decision-making, which also rely heavily on expert feedback and trust calibration in high-stakes environments. For example, incorporating multi-source information fusion techniques to aggregate trust signals not only from direct domain expert feedback but also from system telemetry, user behavioral data, or auxiliary NLP modules could increase robustness and broaden applicability. Additionally, coupling the trust feedback loop with reinforcement learning algorithms to adaptively optimize system responses in dynamic environments can open avenues for real-time policy improvements and sim-to-real transfer strategies. Embedding such globally-linked concepts would differentiate this research by enabling richer, multi-modal, and dynamically adaptive trust calibration mechanisms, moving beyond single-domain continuous calibration. This direction may also help scale the approach towards other high-stakes domains such as healthcare or mobile robot navigation, thereby increasing community and industrial impact.\" , \"target_section\":\"Overall Proposal\"}]}  ?>}  Code Snippet End.
