To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input  x  is modified using a template into a textual string prompt  x′  that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string  x̂  , from which the final output  y  can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: It allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this article, we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g.,\\xa0the choice of pre-trained language models, prompts, and tuning strategies. To make the field more accessible to interested beginners, we not only make a systematic review of existing works and a highly structured typology of prompt-based concepts but also release other resources, e.g., a website NLPedia–Pretrain including constantly updated survey and paperlist. '}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'KnowPrompt: Knowledge-aware Prompt-tuning with Synergistic Optimization for Relation Extraction', 'abstract': 'Recently, prompt-tuning has achieved promising results for specific few-shot classification tasks. The core idea of prompt-tuning is to insert text pieces (i.e., templates) into the input and transform a classification task into a masked language modeling problem. However, for relation extraction, determining an appropriate prompt template requires domain expertise, and it is cumbersome and time-consuming to obtain a suitable label word. Furthermore, there exists abundant semantic and prior knowledge among the relation labels that cannot be ignored. To this end, we focus on incorporating knowledge among relation labels into prompt-tuning for relation extraction and propose a Knowledge-aware Prompt-tuning approach with synergistic optimization (KnowPrompt). Specifically, we inject latent knowledge contained in relation labels into prompt construction with learnable virtual type words and answer words. Then, we synergistically optimize their representation with structured constraints. Extensive experimental results on five datasets with standard and low-resource settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code and datasets are available in GitHub1 for reproducibility.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Prompt Programming for Large Language Models: Beyond the Few-Shot Paradigm', 'abstract': 'Prevailing methods for mapping large generative language models to supervised tasks may fail to sufficiently probe models’ novel capabilities. Using GPT-3 as a case study, we show that 0-shot prompts can significantly outperform few-shot prompts. We suggest that the function of few-shot examples in these cases is better described as locating an already learned task rather than meta-learning. This analysis motivates rethinking the role of prompts in controlling and evaluating powerful language models. We discuss methods of prompt programming, emphasizing the usefulness of considering prompts through the lens of natural language. We explore techniques for exploiting the capacity of narratives and cultural anchors to encode nuanced intentions and techniques for encouraging deconstruction of a problem into components before producing a verdict. Informed by this more encompassing theory of prompt programming, we also introduce the idea of a metaprompt that seeds the model to generate its own natural language prompts for a range of tasks. Finally, we discuss how these more general methods of interacting with language models can be incorporated into existing and future benchmarks and practical applications.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Document-level Relation Extraction as Semantic Segmentation', 'abstract': 'Document-level relation extraction aims to extract relations among multiple entity pairs from a document. Previously proposed graph-based or transformer-based models utilize the entities independently, regardless of global information among relational triples. This paper approaches the problem by predicting an entity-level relation matrix to capture local and global information, parallel to the semantic segmentation task in computer vision. Herein, we propose a Document U-shaped Network for document-level relation extraction. Specifically, we leverage an encoder module to capture the context information of entities and a U-shaped segmentation module over the image-style feature map to capture global interdependency among triples. Experimental results show that our approach can obtain state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets DocRED, CDR, and GDA.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'How Can We Know When Language Models Know? On the Calibration of Language Models for Question Answering', 'abstract': 'Abstract\\n                  Recent works have shown that language models (LM) capture different types of knowledge regarding facts or common sense. However, because no model is perfect, they still fail to provide appropriate answers in many cases. In this paper, we ask the question, “How can we know when language models know, with confidence, the answer to a particular query?” We examine this question from the point of view of calibration, the property of a probabilistic model’s predicted probabilities actually being well correlated with the probabilities of correctness. We examine three strong generative models—T5, BART, and GPT-2—and study whether their probabilities on QA tasks are well calibrated, finding the answer is a relatively emphatic no. We then examine methods to calibrate such models to make their confidence scores correlate better with the likelihood of correctness through fine-tuning, post-hoc probability modification, or adjustment of the predicted outputs or inputs. Experiments on a diverse range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. We also perform analysis to study the strengths and limitations of these methods, shedding light on further improvements that may be made in methods for calibrating LMs. We have released the code at https://github.com/jzbjyb/lm-calibration.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Effect of confidence and explanation on accuracy and trust calibration in AI-assisted decision making', 'abstract': \"Today, AI is being increasingly used to help human experts make decisions in high-stakes scenarios. In these scenarios, full automation is often undesirable, not only due to the significance of the outcome, but also because human experts can draw on their domain knowledge complementary to the model's to ensure task success. We refer to these scenarios as AI-assisted decision making, where the individual strengths of the human and the AI come together to optimize the joint decision outcome. A key to their success is to appropriately calibrate human trust in the AI on a case-by-case basis; knowing when to trust or distrust the AI allows the human expert to appropriately apply their knowledge, improving decision outcomes in cases where the model is likely to perform poorly. This research conducts a case study of AI-assisted decision making in which humans and AI have comparable performance alone, and explores whether features that reveal case-specific model information can calibrate trust and improve the joint performance of the human and AI. Specifically, we study the effect of showing confidence score and local explanation for a particular prediction. Through two human experiments, we show that confidence score can help calibrate people's trust in an AI model, but trust calibration alone is not sufficient to improve AI-assisted decision making, which may also depend on whether the human can bring in enough unique knowledge to complement the AI's errors. We also highlight the problems in using local explanation for AI-assisted decision making scenarios and invite the research community to explore new approaches to explainability for calibrating human trust in AI.\"}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Developing and Validating Trust Measures for e-Commerce: An Integrative Typology', 'abstract': 'Evidence suggests that consumers often hesitate to transact with Web-based vendors because of uncertainty about vendor behavior or the perceived risk of having personal information stolen by hackers. Trust plays a central role in helping consumers overcome perceptions of risk and insecurity. Trust makes consumers comfortable sharing personal information, making purchases, and acting on Web vendor advice—behaviors essential to widespread adoption of e-commerce. Therefore, trust is critical to both researchers and practitioners. Prior research on e-commerce trust has used diverse, incomplete, and inconsistent definitions of trust, making it difficult to compare results across studies. This paper contributes by proposing and validating measures for a multidisciplinary, multidimensional model of trust in e-commerce. The model includes four high-level constructs—disposition to trust, institution-based trust, trusting beliefs, and trusting intentions—which are further delineated into 16 measurable, literature-grounded subconstructs. The psychometric properties of the measures are demonstrated through use of a hypothetical, legal advice Web site. The results show that trust is indeed a multidimensional concept. Proposed relationships among the trust constructs are tested (for internal nomological validity), as are relationships between the trust constructs and three other e-commerce constructs (for external nomological validity), as Web experience, personal innovativeness, and Web site quality. Suggestions for future research as well as implications for practice are discussed.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Trust in Automation: Designing for Appropriate Reliance', 'abstract': 'Automation is often problematic because people fail to rely upon it appropriately. Because people respond to technology socially, trust influences reliance on automation. In particular, trust guides reliance when complexity and unanticipated situations make a complete understanding of the automation impractical. This review considers trust from the organizational, sociological, interpersonal, psychological, and neurological perspectives. It considers how the context, automation characteristics, and cognitive processes affect the appropriateness of trust. The context in which the automation is used influences automation performance and provides a goal-oriented perspective to assess automation characteristics along a dimension of attributional abstraction. These characteristics can influence trust through analytic, analogical, and affective processes. The challenges of extrapolating the concept of trust in people to trust in automation are discussed. A conceptual model integrates research regarding trust in automation and describes the dynamics of trust, the role of context, and the influence of display characteristics. Actual or potential applications of this research include improved designs of systems that require people to manage imperfect automation.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'How Can We Know What Language Models Know?', 'abstract': 'Recent work has presented intriguing results examining the knowledge contained in language models (LMs) by having the LM fill in the blanks of prompts such as “ Obama is a __ by profession”. These prompts are usually manually created, and quite possibly sub-optimal; another prompt such as “ Obama worked as a __ ” may result in more accurately predicting the correct profession. Because of this, given an inappropriate prompt, we might fail to retrieve facts that the LM does know, and thus any given prompt only provides a lower bound estimate of the knowledge contained in an LM. In this paper, we attempt to more accurately estimate the knowledge contained in LMs by automatically discovering better prompts to use in this querying process. Specifically, we propose mining-based and paraphrasing-based methods to automatically generate high-quality and diverse prompts, as well as ensemble methods to combine answers from different prompts. Extensive experiments on the LAMA benchmark for extracting relational knowledge from LMs demonstrate that our methods can improve accuracy from 31.1% to 39.6%, providing a tighter lower bound on what LMs know. We have released the code and the resulting LM Prompt And Query Archive (LPAQA) at https://github.com/jzbjyb/LPAQA .'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Assessing the Ability of LSTMs to Learn Syntax-Sensitive Dependencies', 'abstract': 'The success of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks in language processing is typically attributed to their ability to capture long-distance statistical regularities. Linguistic regularities are often sensitive to syntactic structure; can such dependencies be captured by LSTMs, which do not have explicit structural representations? We begin addressing this question using number agreement in English subject-verb dependencies. We probe the architecture’s grammatical competence both using training objectives with an explicit grammatical target (number prediction, grammaticality judgments) and using language models. In the strongly supervised settings, the LSTM achieved very high overall accuracy (less than 1% errors), but errors increased when sequential and structural information conflicted. The frequency of such errors rose sharply in the language-modeling setting. We conclude that LSTMs can capture a non-trivial amount of grammatical structure given targeted supervision, but stronger architectures may be required to further reduce errors; furthermore, the language modeling signal is insufficient for capturing syntax-sensitive dependencies, and should be supplemented with more direct supervision if such dependencies need to be captured.'}]\n```\n\n**Part A.2: The Evolution Links (Edges of the Graph):**\nThe following list defines the citation relationships between the papers in Part A.

    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem in current research is effectively adapting large language models (LLMs) to domain-specific tasks through methods such as prompt-tuning and fine-tuning, leveraging underlying knowledge representations for improved performance in relation extraction, question answering, and classification tasks. Dominant methodologies build on prompt-based learning paradigms that reformulate downstream tasks (e.g., classification, relation extraction) into masked language modeling or generation tasks, often incorporating knowledge-aware components via knowledge embeddings or virtual type words to enhance domain expertise capture. Recent efforts emphasize global contextual modeling, such as document-level relation extraction using semantic segmentation and capturing dependencies beyond local entity pairs. Trust calibration and confidence estimation in LLM outputs for question answering reveal the need for reliable model introspection. Importantly, synergistic optimization between knowledge embeddings and prompt parameters reflects a movement beyond naïve fine-tuning to structured, knowledge-aware adjustments. These trends directly respond to early limitations where unstructured prompts and purely language modeling signals insufficiently captured domain-specific knowledge and syntactic dependencies.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internally, the evolutionary trajectory shows persistent challenges in calibrating model confidence and interpretability, limiting trust in AI-assisted decision making by human experts despite advances in fine-tuning and prompt methods. Existing prompt engineering often requires domain expertise and manual effort, with automatic prompt mining still an imperfect approximation. Moreover, approaches predominantly focus on textual semantic contexts and relation extraction in isolation, with limited integration of structured global knowledge (e.g., from knowledge bases or graph embeddings) that could enrich domain-specific understanding. The narrow focus on language-only datasets misses opportunities in multimodal or cross-domain knowledge fusion. Externally, the global context highlights overlooked intersections, such as leveraging e-commerce domain knowledge, supply chain data, and user behavior analytics to inform LLM fine-tuning and trust calibration, especially in high-stakes, real-world systems. Novel cross-disciplinary links between probability of correctness and human trust models remain underutilized, as does graph neural network-based aggregation of global context in knowledge bases to enhance classification and relation extraction tasks. Importantly, no large-scale studies bridge domain expert interactions and real-time feedback loops for continuous trust calibration and model refinement.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "1. Trust-Calibrated Domain Expert-in-the-Loop LLM Fine-Tuning: Develop frameworks that integrate human expert feedback with probabilistic calibration methods to dynamically adjust LLM outputs and improve confidence interpretability, informed by research on AI-assisted decision trust and calibration gaps. This addresses reliability and trust issues highlighted internally and links with human trust and classification task concepts from the local network and global focus on human experts and probability correctness.  \n\n2. Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Prompt and Embedding Synergistic Tuning: Innovate methods that combine structured global knowledge from domain-specific knowledge bases via graph neural networks with prompt-tuning strategies, enabling richer semantic and relational context incorporation for relation extraction and QA tasks. This fuses the internal gaps around global information and structured knowledge with global cross-domain concepts tying e-commerce, graph neural networks, and classification tasks.  \n\n3. Cross-Domain Benchmarking and Adaptation Using E-commerce Data Scenarios: Exploit large-scale data from e-commerce and supply chain domains as rich testbeds for transfer learning and domain adaptation of LLMs fine-tuned with knowledge base embeddings, addressing an external gap where practical, complex domain-specific challenges remain underexplored. Incorporating user behavior and platform quality data can enhance LLM calibration and interaction with human decision makers, grounding abstract models in realistic applications and linking local e-commerce cluster insights with global recommendations and user behavior data."
