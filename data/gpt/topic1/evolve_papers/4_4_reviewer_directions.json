    "title": "Cross-Modal Memory Augmentation via Structural-Sequence Embedding Fusion in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Protein folding predictors and LLMs lack effective frameworks to fuse complementary structural and sequence modalities into shared memory representations for improved long-term reasoning.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the cross-disciplinary gap by building a fusion framework that unifies RoseTTAFold structural embeddings with sequence embeddings in a combined memory module, facilitating cross-modal reasoning and memory retrieval.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design cross-modal embedding alignment techniques that jointly encode protein sequence and predicted structural features into a harmonized latent space stored in memory-augmented LLM architectures. Introduce cross-modal attention layers allowing memory queries to access both modalities effectively for enhanced reasoning.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Extract paired sequence and RoseTTAFold structure embeddings for protein datasets. 2. Train an embedding fusion network optimizing for cross-modal similarity and downstream task objectives. 3. Integrate fused embeddings into LLM memory update pipelines. 4. Evaluate on multi-modal protein function prediction and reasoning tasks. 5. Compare with unimodal memory retrieval baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Protein sequence with partial structural data; Task: Predict functional sites using combined memory of sequence and structure. Output: Enhanced prediction accuracy leveraging fused memory compared to sequence-only or structure-only memories.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "In case of fusion complexity, implement late-fusion strategies combining separate unimodal memory reads post-hoc with gating mechanisms."

          "feedback_content": "While the concept of fusing sequence and structural embeddings into a shared memory module is compelling, the proposal lacks clarity on the precise architectural and algorithmic mechanisms for cross-modal embedding alignment and memory augmentation within LLMs. Details such as how the cross-modal attention layers operate, how memory queries integrate both modalities, and how the harmonized latent space is constructed and maintained throughout the model pipeline need elaboration to validate soundness and reproducibility. Providing a schematic or algorithmic description would enhance understanding and assessment of the proposed mechanism's feasibility and robustness, especially given the complexity of integrating heterogeneous biological modalities into language models' memory modules. Please explicitly address these points in the Proposed_Method section to improve model clarity and technical soundness."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as 'NOV-COMPETITIVE,' the proposal would benefit greatly from explicitly positioning itself at the intersection of recent advances in big models and leveraging graph neural networks to further capture topological relationships inherent in protein structures. For instance, incorporating graph neural network-based embeddings or reasoning methods alongside RoseTTAFold features within the memory module could enrich the structural representation and augment reasoning capabilities. Additionally, framing the application within knowledge discovery pipelines or big data-driven protein function prediction, potentially inspired by progress in next-generation sequencing data analysis, can broaden the impact and appeal to a wider audience in computational biology and AI. Integrate these globally linked concepts to enhance novelty and demonstrate cross-disciplinary synergy."
