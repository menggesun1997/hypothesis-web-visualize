    "title": "Domain-Adaptive Pretraining of Language Models with Socio-Legal Health Knowledge for Equitable AI Assistants",
    "Problem_Statement": "Large language models lack domain-specific pretraining integrating clinical language, social determinants of health, and legal fairness constraints, limiting their effectiveness in supporting equitable primary care decisions.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap of unexplored domain-adaptive pretraining incorporating socio-legal knowledge for fairness-aware clinical AI, responding to the third high-potential innovation opportunity linking natural language processing advances and healthcare socio-legal frameworks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose SLP-LLM (Socio-Legal Pretrained LLM), performing multi-stage pretraining: first on clinical notes (e.g., EHR data), second on social determinants of health corpora, and third on legal documents concerning antidiscrimination and healthcare ethics. A novel loss function regularizes LLM embeddings to reflect fairness constraints derived from legal fairness ontologies. The model acts as an AI assistant generating equitable decision support explanations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Aggregate corpora from clinical EHR datasets, public health social determinants datasets, and legal frameworks. 2) Pretrain LLM sequentially on these corpora using standard masked language modeling and contrastive fairness losses. 3) Fine-tune the model on benchmark healthcare QA and decision support tasks. 4) Evaluate fairness improvements using bias metrics, along with clinical accuracy and relevant language generation metrics. 5) Compare with LLMs pretrained solely on clinical data.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical query about treatment options considering patient socioeconomic background. Expected output: Context-aware, fairness-conscious recommendation highlighting social determinants impacts and adherence to anti-discrimination regulations in suggested care plans.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-stage pretraining shows diminishing returns or instability, isolate contributions via ablation studies and consider modular adapter-based architectures injecting socio-legal knowledge without full retraining."

        "title": "Interactive Socio-Legal AI Agent with Domain-Adaptive Pretraining for Fair and Context-Aware Clinical Decision Support",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language models (LLMs) lack robust integration of heterogeneous socio-legal and clinical domains crucial for equitable primary care. Moreover, existing pretraining approaches do not operationalize fairness constraints dynamically within interactive clinical workflows. This limits AI assistants' ability to provide context-aware, legally compliant, and socially sensitive decision support in real-time clinical settings.",
        "Motivation": "While prior efforts have explored domain-adaptive LLM pretraining on clinical data, they often treat socio-legal knowledge integration as static and isolated stages, limiting novelty and real-world impact. Our approach innovatively positions a socio-legal pretrained LLM (SLP-LLM) as the knowledge and reasoning core of an interactive AI agent that dynamically engages with clinical workflows, patients, and legal experts. This end-to-end agent system advances beyond batch pretraining by coupling multi-stage domain adaptation with dialog management, active data querying, and real-time fairness auditing—establishing a novel paradigm that tightly integrates advances in NLP, AI agents, and socio-legal health to yield practical, fairness-aware clinical AI assistants.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose the Socio-Legal Pretrained Language Model (SLP-LLM) embedded at the center of an interactive AI agent framework for equitable clinical decision support. First, SLP-LLM undergoes modular multi-stage domain-adaptive pretraining: (1) clinical notes from electronic health records (EHRs), (2) curated social determinants of health (SDoH) corpora, and (3) structured and unstructured legal documents on anti-discrimination and healthcare ethics. To manage heterogeneity and domain shifts, we design specialized preprocessing pipelines including token normalization, domain alignment embeddings, and privacy-preserving data handling protocols. A novel contrastive fairness regularization loss, grounded in ontologies of legal fairness norms, guides embedding space structure to reflect equity constraints. Crucially, to ensure training stability and assess optimization, we introduce progressive validation experiments on small-scale datasets and modular adapter components that enable plug-and-play socio-legal knowledge injection without full model retraining. \n\nSecond, instead of static inference, we integrate SLP-LLM within an AI agent featuring dialog management modules and active querying capabilities to solicit missing social determinant information dynamically from patients or clinical data sources. The agent continuously audits generated recommendations against fairness checks using embedded legal knowledge modules and provides transparent, legally grounded decision explanations. A modular connector architecture supports seamless integration with existing clinical decision systems and legal AI agents, fostering scalability and adoption.\n\nThis integration of interactive AI agents with multi-domain pretrained LLMs and real-time fairness auditing substantially distinguishes our work from solely domain-adaptive LLM pretraining, significantly elevating novelty, scientific rigor, and real-world impact.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Acquisition & Preprocessing: Collect clinical EHR notes from partnered healthcare institutions, publicly available SDoH datasets (e.g., community surveys, census data), and legal corpora including healthcare laws, regulations, and anti-discrimination policies. Develop harmonized preprocessing pipelines to manage data heterogeneity, ensure data privacy compliance (HIPAA, GDPR), and create aligned token embeddings across domains.\n\n2) Preliminary Validation of Fairness Loss & Adapters: Conduct controlled experiments on small, representative subsets to validate the contrastive fairness loss function’s optimization tractability and embedding regularization efficacy. Experiment with modular adapter injections for each domain to assess stability and contributions prior to large-scale pretraining.\n\n3) Multi-Stage Domain-Adaptive Pretraining: Sequentially pretrain the base LLM using masked language modeling and fairness-regularized losses, progressively incorporating each domain corpus. Monitor training stability, convergence, and representativeness.\n\n4) Integration into Interactive AI Agent: Implement dialog management and active querying pipelines interfacing with SLP-LLM. Develop real-time fairness auditing components based on legal ontologies. Employ plug-and-play modular connectors to existing clinical and legal AI workflows.\n\n5) Fine-Tuning & Evaluation: Fine-tune the integrated agent on benchmark healthcare QA and clinical decision support tasks with embedded fairness constraints. Evaluate using a battery of clinically relevant accuracy metrics, bias and fairness evaluation metrics (e.g., equalized odds, subgroup calibration), and language generation quality assessments.\n\n6) Comparative and Ablation Studies: Compare performance against LLMs pretrained solely on clinical data and non-interactive baselines. Ablate adapter modules and interaction components to isolate contributions.\n\n7) Resource Planning & Timelines: Estimate computational requirements, annotate timelines for each phase, and plan cross-disciplinary team coordination for clinical, social, and legal domains.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A clinician’s query: 'What treatment options are recommended for this diabetic patient considering their recent unemployment and housing instability?' alongside patient demographic and partial socioeconomic data.\n\nExpected Output: An interactive agent response that (a) requests missing social determinant details if needed; (b) provides treatment recommendations sensitively adjusted based on socioeconomic context; (c) transparently explains how recommendations comply with anti-discrimination laws and ethical standards; (d) highlights potential fairness considerations and options to mitigate disparities.\n\nThe system dynamically integrates clinical, social, and legal knowledge to offer actionable, equitable, and legally sound decision support.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-stage domain-adaptive pretraining exhibits instability or diminishing returns, fall back to a modular adapter-based architecture, where separate lightweight adapters encode socio-legal and social determinant knowledge without full LLM retraining. Early-stage small-scale experiments validating the fairness loss function and adapter contributions will guide refinements or alternatives. The AI agent framework also enables isolated deployment of interactive fairness auditing and dialog management modules, allowing iterative integration without retraining the entire language model. This strategy reduces risk and maintains progress toward operational socio-legal clinical AI assistants."

The plan should clarify how data privacy, domain differences, and data preprocessing will be handled to ensure training stability and representativeness. Additionally, the novel loss function regularizing embeddings according to fairness ontologies needs experimental validation steps early on to confirm optimization tractability before full-scale pretraining. Incorporating modular adapter architectures or preliminary small-scale experiments as a fallback could improve feasibility and reduce risks related to model instability or diminishing returns during multi-stage pretraining. Detailed evaluation protocols for bias metrics and how these fairness constraints translate into clinically meaningful improvements need to be explicitly designed in the plan to demonstrate scientific rigor and practical feasibility. Overall, the experiment plan requires further refinement for robust execution and credibility of outcomes, including resource estimates and timelines for each stage of the multi-domain pretraining approach. This enhanced clarity will strongly support feasibility and reproducibility claims in a multi-disciplinary setting involving clinical, social, and legal data sources."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and the globally linked concept \"AI agents,\" the idea could be significantly strengthened by explicitly integrating the SLP-LLM as a core component within a wider interactive AI agent framework. For example, framing the model as the knowledge and reasoning backbone of an AI agent that not only generates equitable decision support explanations but dynamically interacts with clinical workflows, patients, and legal advisors could extend impact and novelty. Envisioning and proposing an end-to-end socio-legal AI assistant agent system—including dialog management, active querying about social determinants, and real-time fairness auditing—would tap into cutting-edge AI agent research trends while emphasizing real-world applicability. Such integration would differentiate this work from other domain-adaptive LLM pretraining efforts, amplify societal impact by operationalizing fairness concerns in clinical settings, and open new avenues for research combining NLP, AI agents, and socio-legal health domains. A modular connector architecture allowing plug-and-play with existing clinical and legal AI agents or electronic health systems would also enhance practicality and adoption prospects."
