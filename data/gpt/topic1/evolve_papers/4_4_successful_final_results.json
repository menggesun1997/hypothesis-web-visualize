        "title": "Graph-Enhanced Cross-Modal Memory Fusion for Protein Reasoning in Large Language Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current protein folding predictors and large language models (LLMs) struggle to effectively fuse complementary sequence and structural modalities into unified memory representations, limiting their capacity for integrative long-term reasoning over protein data. Existing methods lack detailed architectural frameworks that reconcile heterogeneous biological modalities within memory-augmented LLMs, hindering reproducibility and robustness.",
        "Motivation": "This work addresses the gap by explicitly designing a novel graph-enhanced cross-modal embedding fusion framework that integrates sequence data, RoseTTAFold-derived structural embeddings, and graph neural network (GNN) based topological representations of protein structures into a harmonized, memory-augmented latent space. By situating our approach at the intersection of big-model capabilities, structural bioinformatics, and graph-based topological reasoning, we aim to enable richer memory representations that substantially advance protein function prediction and reasoning beyond existing unimodal and shallow fusion approaches. This integration also aligns with data mining trends in leveraging next-generation sequencing alongside structural data to fuel knowledge discovery, thereby broadening impact across computational biology and AI.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a three-tier fusion architecture within memory-augmented LLMs: (1) Extraction of protein sequence embeddings using pretrained LLM encoders; (2) Derivation of structural embeddings from RoseTTAFold and parallel generation of residue-level graph representations capturing protein topology, encoded through a graph neural network; (3) A cross-modal embedding alignment module that employs multi-head cross-attention layers where memory queries jointly attend to sequence embeddings, structural embeddings, and GNN outputs to produce a harmonized latent embedding stored in a shared memory bank. This module maintains modality-specific encoding streams but aligns them through learned projection matrices and contrastive losses enforcing semantic similarity across modalities. The memory update pipeline incorporates gating mechanisms to balance unimodal and fused representations dynamically. We provide formal algorithmic specifications detailing the cross-attention computations, memory addressing, and embedding harmonization, alongside a schematic diagram illustrating data flowâ€”ensuring clarity, soundness, and reproducibility. Through this design, the model captures local sequence patterns, global 3D structural features, and explicit topological relationships, enabling enriched cross-modal long-term reasoning.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect paired protein datasets with sequences, RoseTTAFold-predicted structures, and annotated functional sites. 2. Construct residue-level protein graphs from structures and train the GNN encoder. 3. Pretrain cross-modal embedding alignment module with contrastive objectives ensuring semantic consistency across sequence, structure, and graph embeddings. 4. Integrate fused embeddings within a memory-augmented LLM and refine end-to-end on protein function prediction and reasoning tasks. 5. Evaluate model variants on benchmark datasets, comparing against unimodal baselines and late-fusion strategies. 6. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of GNN integration and cross-attention architectural elements. 7. Assess scalability on large, next-generation sequencing-informed protein datasets to demonstrate big-model applicability and knowledge discovery potential.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Protein sequence with partial structural data and graph-based topology; Task: Predict ligand-binding and functional sites by querying the fused memory module that integrates sequence, structural, and graph embeddings. Output: Enhanced prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to models using only sequence or RoseTTAFold embeddings, validated on held-out datasets. Case study results include improved identification of allosteric sites enabled by topological awareness within the fused memory.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If integration complexity hinders training stability or performance gains, fallback to a late-fusion approach where unimodal memory reads from sequence, structure, and graph modules are combined post-hoc using learned gating networks that balance contributions based on task signals. Additionally, fallback to simplified fusion modules removing graph embeddings while retaining cross-attention between sequence and RoseTTAFold embeddings to maintain core cross-modal benefits."
