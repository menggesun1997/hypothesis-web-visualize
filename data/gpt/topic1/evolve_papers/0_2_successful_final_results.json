    "title": "Clickthrough-Guided Latent Semantic Model Adaptation for Domain-Robust RAG",
    "Problem_Statement": "RAG systems lack robust domain adaptation and operational reliability since they do not sufficiently leverage real-world interaction signals like clickthrough data for dynamic relevance feedback and continual learning.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the external gap of integrating clickthrough data with latent semantic retrieval, this research blends crowd interaction signals and user feedback into RAG training loops for enhanced domain adaptation and system robustness, going beyond static latent semantic models.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a feedback-augmented RAG framework where live user interaction signals—clickthroughs, dwell time, explicit feedback—are used to dynamically update latent semantic embeddings in the retriever via online learning. The retriever and generator jointly adapt to emerging domains, with crowdsourcing pipelines enabling correction of errors. This method will introduce a hybrid offline-online training paradigm, exploiting continuous relevance refinement and user expectation modeling. Novel clickthrough-aware loss functions will modulate retrieval ranking during training.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Gather datasets with associated click logs (e.g., MS MARCO with clickthrough data). 2. Develop latent semantic retriever fine-tuned on click-guided relevance judgments. 3. Implement online learning modules to update retriever embeddings with live simulated user interactions. 4. Fine-tune generator jointly with retriever adaptively updating for domain shifts. 5. Measure domain adaptation success on specialized datasets (healthcare, finance) with user feedback simulations. 6. Evaluate improvements in retrieval precision, generation factuality, and user satisfaction proxies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User queries medical information, clicks on retrieved documents about 'diabetes symptoms'. The system updates embedding weights to better prioritize similar health-related documents for future queries. Expected Output: Subsequent responses better grounded in verified medical knowledge, with reduced hallucinations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If online learning proves unstable, introduce mini-batch update regimes with validation checkpoints. Alternatively, simulate batch re-training with synthetic clickthrough expansion. Employ active learning with human-in-the-loop validation as a safety net."

        "title": "Graph-Augmented Clickthrough-Guided Latent Semantic Model Adaptation for Domain-Robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face persistent challenges in robustly adapting to diverse domains due to limited incorporation of real-world user interaction signals and inadequate exploitation of structured domain knowledge. Existing approaches primarily use latent semantic embeddings updated via clickthrough data but often ignore the propagation of user feedback through explicit graph-based knowledge representations, limiting retrieval precision, domain awareness, and system interpretability.",
        "Motivation": "To transcend the NOV-COMPETITIVE barrier and meaningfully advance RAG robustness and domain adaptation, this research integrates rich clickthrough interaction signals with explicit graph-structured knowledge representations and learning-to-rank mechanisms. By doing so, the approach enriches latent semantic retriever embeddings with interpretable concept and entity graphs contextualizing user feedback, which enhances generalization in low-resource specialized domains such as healthcare and finance. This hybrid dense vector plus graph-based feedback mechanism aims to substantially improve cross-domain knowledge discovery, retrieval relevance, and generation factuality beyond static or purely latent update schemes.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel hybrid offline-online training framework for RAG systems that jointly adapts retriever and generator components dynamically using clickthrough-guided relevance feedback enhanced by graph-based knowledge representation learning. Key innovations include: (1) Construction of explicit domain-specific knowledge graphs (entities, concepts, relations) that contextualize documents and queries. (2) Integration of graph embeddings with dense latent semantic embeddings within the retriever to propagate clickthrough feedback beyond vectors, enabling robust cross-domain generalization and interpretability. (3) A clickthrough-aware learning-to-rank loss function that leverages both user feedback signals and structured graph context to refine retrieval rankings during offline and online phases. (4) An online learning scheme with synchronized incremental updates at fixed intervals, including stability regularization and computational budget monitoring to jointly fine-tune retriever embeddings and generator parameters. (5) A crowdsourcing pipeline to validate and expand knowledge graphs, ensuring correction of model drifts and domain-specific nuances. This comprehensive method contrasts prior approaches by harnessing the synergy between user interactions, graph-based knowledge, and ranking models, rendering adaptive and reliable RAG systems suitable for complex, evolving domains.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset Preparation: Compile multiple benchmark datasets with clickthrough logs (e.g., MS MARCO with real click data), and specialized domain corpora (healthcare, finance) with supplementary human-verified knowledge graph annotations or mappings.  \n2. Knowledge Graph Construction: Build explicit domain graphs (entities, concepts, relations) from document collections using state-of-the-art NLP entity extraction and relation learning tools, refining them via crowdsourced validation.\n3. Retriever Enhancement: Develop a hybrid retriever embedding architecture combining dense latent vectors with graph-based embeddings, training offline with a clickthrough-aware learning-to-rank loss.  \n4. Simulator for User Interactions: Design a realistic user interaction simulator informed by logged click patterns, dwell times, and query reformulation behaviors to generate live-like feedback signals reflecting domain shifts.\n5. Online Learning Module: Implement incremental synchronization cycles (e.g., every 1000 interactions) where retriever and generator jointly update embeddings and generation parameters, using stability monitoring metrics (embedding divergence thresholds) and computational cost logging to ensure tractability.\n6. Evaluation Protocol: Measure retrieval precision (Recall@k, MRR), generation factuality (fact-based metrics, hallucination rates), and user satisfaction proxies (personalized relevance scores, engagement-based metrics). Baselines will include static latent retrievers, click-through unsupervised updates, and graph-less RAG models.\n7. Domain Adaptation Assessment: Assess cross-domain generalization on low-resource specialized datasets and conduct ablation studies on the impact of graph augmentation and learning-to-rank components.\n8. Mitigation Strategies: If instability arises, deploy mini-batch update regimes with adaptive learning rates and incorporate human-in-the-loop active learning for graph corrections and model validation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user queries 'latest diabetes treatment options' and clicks on retrieved documents discussing recent therapies linked to diabetes in the healthcare knowledge graph.\n\nSystem Behavior: The system updates both latent embeddings and propagates feedback through graph edges related to diabetes treatments, boosting prioritization of authoritative medical documents in related subdomains.\n\nExpected Output: Subsequent responses show higher retrieval precision towards clinically validated treatments, combined with generator outputs that reduce hallucinated or outdated information, demonstrably improving user trust and satisfaction.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should online learning become unstable or computationally prohibitive, we will implement batch update regimes using mini-batches of aggregated interaction data with conservative update steps, monitored via embedding drift metrics. If graph integration challenges arise, we will incrementally phase in graph-based components starting with simpler entity co-occurrence graphs, enabling controlled experimentation. Alternatively, synthetic clickthrough expansions and active learning with human-in-the-loop corrections will be utilized to maintain domain adaptation fidelity and prevent degradation. These measures ensure methodological robustness and experimental feasibility in face of unexpected challenges."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experimental plan, while broadly outlined, lacks important operational details critical for ensuring feasibility and reproducibility. For example, the plan should explicitly specify how \"live simulated user interactions\" will be realistically generated or sourced to reflect genuine clickthrough dynamics across domains. Furthermore, the approach to jointly fine-tuning the retriever and generator needs clearer articulation on synchronization frequency, stability monitoring, and computational budget. Detailing the evaluation metrics for \"user satisfaction proxies\" and defining baseline comparisons when adapting to specialized domains (e.g., healthcare, finance) would also strengthen practical study execution. Without these specifics, implementing the method risks instability or inconclusive outcomes. I recommend the authors revise the experiment plan to provide concrete methodology, anticipated challenges, and mitigation strategies around online learning, incremental updates, and domain adaptation measurement to improve scientific rigor and feasibility assessment in a competitive space like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This clarification is critical for peer reviewers and implementers alike to assess and trust the experimental workload and approach efficacy. Targeting this clear gap will materially increase the work's impact and likelihood of success in premier venues, given the complexity of dynamic relevance feedback integration in RAG systems today.  \n\nPlease revise the \"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\" section accordingly with these points in mind.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict of NOV-COMPETITIVE and the presented research focusing on clickthrough-guided latent semantic adaptation in RAG, I strongly suggest integrating graph-based approaches and knowledge representation learning, as noted in the linked concepts. Specifically, the model could benefit from incorporating an explicit graph-structured knowledge representation (e.g., entity or concept graphs) to contextualize and propagate clickthrough feedback beyond simple latent vector updates. This could make user interaction signals more robust, interpretable, and domain-aware, enhancing cross-domain knowledge discovery and retrieval precision, particularly in low-resource or specialized language domains. Additionally, aligning ranking functions with learning-to-rank algorithms that leverage these structured embeddings may further strengthen performance and relevance ranking during domain shifts. Emphasizing such hybrid dense vector plus graph-based retrieval architectures within the offline-online training paradigm may substantially lift impact and novelty in light of strong existing baselines. Please explicitly consider and outline this potential global integration in the \"Proposed_Method\" or as an extension recommendation to significantly deepen cross-disciplinary innovation and confer distinguishing advantage in the competitive landscape of RAG-related research."
