Here we examine breakthroughs over the past decade that include self-supervised learning, which allows models to be trained on vast amounts of unlabelled data, and geometric deep learning, which leverages knowledge about the structure of scientific data to enhance model accuracy and efficiency. Generative AI methods can create designs, such as small-molecule drugs and proteins, by analysing diverse data modalities, including images and sequences. We discuss how these methods can help scientists throughout the scientific process and the central issues that remain despite such advances. Both developers and users of AI tools need a better understanding of when such approaches need improvement, and challenges posed by poor data quality and stewardship remain. These issues cut across scientific disciplines and require developing foundational algorithmic approaches that can contribute to scientific understanding or acquire it autonomously, making them critical areas of focus for AI innovation.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'ColabFold: making protein folding accessible to all', 'abstract': 'ColabFold offers accelerated prediction of protein structures and complexes by combining the fast homology search of MMseqs2 with AlphaFold2 or RoseTTAFold.

Through an enormous experimental effort1, 2, 3–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50\\xa0years9. Despite recent progress10, 11, 12, 13–14, existing methods fall far\\xa0short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Array programming with NumPy', 'abstract': 'Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'UniProt: the universal protein knowledgebase in 2021', 'abstract': 'The aim of the UniProt Knowledgebase is to provide users with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible set of protein sequences annotated with functional information.

    "current_research_landscape": "The current research landscape is centered on highly accurate protein structure prediction as a proxy for advancing memory-enhanced architectures that can integrate knowledge bases for efficient, long-term reasoning in LLMs. The dominant methodology builds upon deep learning models exemplified by AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold that leverage multi-sequence alignments and advanced neural architectures to predict protein folding with atomic-level accuracy. This methodological progression follows from the challenges and bottlenecks in traditional experimental structure determination, pushing computational methods to the forefront. The integration of interoperable scientific Python ecosystem tools, such as NumPy and related array programming libraries, supports scalable and efficient data manipulation, acting as connective tissue between conceptual clusters. Key thematic islands comprise precise structure prediction paradigms, computational infrastructures facilitating large-scale protein modeling, and the development of comprehensive, richly annotated protein knowledgebases like UniProt, which serve as critical external memory repositories for these architectures. This reflects a broader consensus emphasizing hybrid approaches tying advanced neural prediction with curated knowledgebases to augment reasoning and prediction capabilities within LLM frameworks.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps highlight that despite breakthroughs in protein folding prediction accuracy, models predominantly focus on short-term structure inference without explicitly embedding long-term reasoning capabilities or dynamic memory mechanisms that could leverage evolving knowledge bases efficiently. Furthermore, there is a lack of integration between the core predictive frameworks and flexible, scalable software infrastructures that unify large multidimensional datasets with real-time updating capabilities necessary for persistent reasoning. Another overlooked aspect is the challenge of interpretability and robustness when extrapolating predictions to novel, unseen protein sequences or domains beyond training distribution, revealing brittleness inherent in current models. Externally, from the global context, underexplored cross-disciplinary bridges exist between the precise protein folding prediction methodologies and flexible interoperable programming interfaces (numpy-like systems), which hold promise for modular, extensible integration of multi-source biological data and LLM memory augmentation. Also, the synergy between RoseTTAFold-based dynamic structural predictions and open-source computational libraries is insufficiently exploited to create continuous learning pipelines that update memory banks in LLMs for lifelong reasoning. These gaps point to a latent opportunity to fuse deep protein knowledge with adaptive computational ecosystems for long-term memory in LLMs, a nexus not yet thoroughly investigated.",

Development of Dynamic Memory-Augmented LLM Architectures Tuned for Biological Knowledge — Leverage the global concept of combining 'accurate protein structure prediction' with 'numpy-like interface' to architect LLMs that maintain and query vast, multidimensional protein structural data seamlessly. This would address the internal gap of static memory usage by enabling continual update and retrieval from dynamic protein knowledgebases, facilitating efficient long-term reasoning over biological sequences and structures.\n\n2. Cross-Modal Integration Framework Linking Structural Biology Predictors with Scalable Scientific Computing Ecosystems — Fuse the major clusters of RoseTTAFold-based prediction models with interoperable Python scientific libraries to create modular, extensible pipelines that update and refine knowledge representations used by LLMs. This innovation tackles the overlooked opportunity to unify predictive accuracy with computational flexibility, supporting generalizable reasoning across diverse biomedical data modalities.\n\n3. Interpretability-Driven LLM Modules Informed by Protein Interaction and Domain Interface Data — Inspired by co-concepts from the global analysis, designing LLM memory components that incorporate detailed domain-domain interaction and protein interface features can enhance interpretability and reasoned decision-making, bridging the gap of model brittleness and improving robustness for novel biological problem-solving within LLM architectures."
