    "title": "Cross-Modal Privacy-Preserving Retrieval-Augmented Prompting in Biomedical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Biomedical LLMs currently underexplore privacy-preserving retrieval mechanisms that incorporate cross-modal biomedical data (text, imaging, signals), hampering model grounding, reasoning, and clinical applicability in sensitive environments.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the external gap (b) about privacy-preserving cross-modal retrieval and internal gap (4) concerning underexplored multimodal integration. It proposes a novel framework that unifies privacy guarantees with knowledge-augmented prompt engineering across data modalities, which existing models neglect.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining multi-modal embeddings (text, images, biosignals) with privacy-preserving retrieval protocols (differential privacy, homomorphic encryption). The retrieval module fetches relevant biomedical evidence mapped to prompt context dynamically. A knowledge graph bridges structured domain knowledge to enhance prompt tuning. This framework composes prompts with fused multi-modal evidence in a privacy-aware manner, enabling respected few-shot learning in clinical settings.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect publicly available biomedical multi-modal datasets with paired modalities. 2. Build retrieval indices with privacy mechanisms and a knowledge graph embedding system. 3. Implement retrieval-augmented prompt engineering in biomedical LLMs (BioGPT, Med-PaLM variants). 4. Baselines: prompt tuning without retrieval, retrieval without privacy, uni-modal retrieval. 5. Metrics: BLEU for generation quality, retrieval precision/recall, privacy guarantee metrics, clinical relevance measured by domain expert evaluation. 6. Ablation on privacy parameters and modality fusion strategies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical note \"Patient with shortness of breath and chest pain\" plus chest X-ray image and ECG signal. Expected output: Accurate diagnostic summary leveraging text and image signals retrieved silently under privacy constraints, e.g., \"Findings consistent with early signs of congestive heart failure.\"",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If privacy mechanisms degrade performance, relax privacy budget and explore federated retrieval. If multi-modal fusion hurts, isolate modality contributions to tune fusion strategies or focus on best-performing modality integration."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method integrates multi-modal embeddings with privacy-preserving protocols and a knowledge graph for prompt tuning, but the technical details on how these components interact remain under-specified. Clarify the mechanism for dynamically composing prompts from fused multi-modal evidence while ensuring privacy guarantees—specifically, detail how retrieval, fusion, and knowledge graph embedding operations maintain privacy without degrading signal quality. This clarity is essential to judge technical soundness and replicate the approach reliably in sensitive clinical settings, where errors bear high cost, and the trade-offs between privacy and retrieval effectiveness are subtle and critical to balance effectively. Without this, the framework risks being theoretically interesting but practically unclear or infeasible in real biomedical environments. This should include outlining which privacy-preserving techniques (differential privacy, homomorphic encryption) are applied where and how their privacy parameters relate to retrieval precision in the context of multi-modal fusion and prompt generation for LLMs in a clinical setting at scale and under latency constraints, if any. Enhancing this clarity will strengthen the methodological foundation and improve confidence in feasibility and impact evaluations.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The experimental plan proposes multiple complex components—multi-modal retrieval with privacy mechanisms, knowledge graph embeddings, prompt engineering on biomedical LLMs—yet it lacks concrete feasibility considerations such as dataset availability, computational scalability, and privacy budget selection strategies. While publicly available biomedical multi-modal datasets exist, their alignment with paired modalities suitable for cross-modal retrieval under privacy constraints is challenging. The plan should detail dataset choices and justify their representativeness with respect to intended clinical scenarios. Moreover, implementing rigorous privacy-preserving retrieval (e.g., homomorphic encryption) is computationally intensive; addressing scalability and computational resource requirements is critical for feasibility. The evaluation metrics are comprehensive but would benefit from a clearer plan on how domain expert clinical relevance evaluation will be operationalized, including criteria, blinded protocols, and sample sizes to produce reliable assessments. Finally, contingency plans for degraded retrieval quality under stringent privacy are good but could be further refined by proposing incremental integration steps (for example, starting with differential privacy parametrization experiments before adding homomorphic encryption) to ensure methodical feasibility assessment. Providing these enhancements will increase confidence that the planned experiments can yield meaningful, reproducible results under realistic biomedical operational constraints."
