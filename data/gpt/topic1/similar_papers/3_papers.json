    "abstract": "This review explores the role of prompt engineering in unleashing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Prompt engineering is the process of structuring inputs, and it has emerged as a crucial technique for maximizing the utility and accuracy of these models. Both foundational and advanced prompt engineering methodologies-including techniques such as self-consistency, chain of thought, and generated knowledge, which can significantly enhance the performance of models-are explored in this paper. Additionally, the prompt methods for vision language models (VLMs) are examined in detail. Prompt methods are evaluated with subjective and objective metrics, ensuring a robust analysis of their efficacy. Critical to this discussion is the role of prompt engineering in artificial intelligence (AI) security, particularly in terms of defending against adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs. Strategies for minimizing these risks and improving the robustness of models are thoroughly reviewed. Finally, we provide a perspective for future research and applications.",

    "abstract": "Epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases in conflict zones are complex threats to public health and humanitarian activities that require creativity approaches of reducing their damage. This narrative review focuses on the technology intersection with infectious disease response in conflict zones, and complexity of healthcare infrastructure, population displacement, and security risks. This narrative review explores how conflict-related destruction is harmful towards healthcare systems and the impediments to disease surveillance and response activities. In this regards, the review also considered the contributions of technological innovations, such as the improvement of epidemiological surveillance, mobile health (mHealth) technologies, genomic sequencing, and surveillance technologies, in strengthening infectious disease management in conflict settings. Ethical issues related to data privacy, security and fairness are also covered. By advisement on policy that focuses on investment in surveillance systems, diagnostic capacity, capacity building, collaboration, and even ethical governance, stakeholders can leverage technology to enhance the response to infectious disease in conflict settings and, thus, protect the global health security. This review is full of information for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners who are dealing with the issues of infectious disease outbreaks in conflicts worn areas.",

    "abstract": "Background: Fiscal decentralization offers potential for stimulating local economic development in Africa, empowering subnational governments to control revenue and spending. However, challenges such as urbanization, poverty, inequality, insufficient infrastructure, and governance issues hinder the successful implementation of the core tenets of fiscal decentralization. This paper explores the role of digital technologies in promoting greater fiscal decentralization and revenue enhancement, as a strategic response to these local economic development challenges in Africa.\nMethod: Through a systematic literature review, this study explores the role of fiscal decentralization in driving local economic development, with a focus on leveraging digital technologies to boost revenue generation and strengthen governance and institutional capacity at the subnational level.\nResults: The research underscores the importance of investing in digital infrastructure, skill development, and regulatory frameworks, while addressing data privacy and security concerns.\nConclusion: By emphasizing the transformative impact of digital technologies fiscal decentralization and property taxation, this paper contributes to the existing literature and highlights avenues for promoting local economic development across Africa.",

    "year": 2024,

    "abstract": "Encryption is a fundamental security measure to safeguard data during transmission to ensure confidentiality while at the same time posing a great challenge for traditional packet and traffic inspection. In response to the proliferation of diverse network traffic patterns from Internet-of-Things devices, websites, and mobile applications, understanding and classifying encrypted traffic are crucial for network administrators, cybersecurity professionals, and policy enforcement entities. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in machine-learning-driven encrypted traffic analysis and classification. The primary goals of our survey are two-fold: First, we present the overall procedure and provide a detailed explanation of utilizing machine learning in analyzing and classifying encrypted network traffic. Second, we review state-of-the-art techniques and methodologies in traffic analysis. Our aim is to provide insights into current practices and future directions in encrypted traffic analysis and classification, especially machine-learning-based analysis.",

    "abstract": "The healthcare sector, characterized by vast datasets and many diseases, is pivotal in shaping community health and overall quality of life. Traditional healthcare methods, often characterized by limitations in disease prevention, predominantly react to illnesses after their onset rather than proactively averting them. The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has ushered in a wave of transformative applications designed to enhance healthcare services, with Machine Learning (ML) as a noteworthy subset of AI. ML empowers computers to analyze extensive datasets, while Deep Learning (DL), a specific ML methodology, excels at extracting meaningful patterns from these data troves. Despite notable technological advancements in recent years, the full potential of these applications within medical contexts remains largely untapped, primarily due to the medical community's cautious stance toward novel technologies. The motivation of this paper lies in recognizing the pivotal role of the healthcare sector in community well-being and the necessity for a shift toward proactive healthcare approaches. To our knowledge, there is a notable absence of a comprehensive published review that delves into ML, DL and distributed systems, all aimed at elevating the Quality of Service (QoS) in healthcare. This study seeks to bridge this gap by presenting a systematic and organized review of prevailing ML, DL, and distributed system algorithms as applied in healthcare settings. Within our work, we outline key challenges that both current and future developers may encounter, with a particular focus on aspects such as approach, data utilization, strategy, and development processes. Our study findings reveal that the Internet of Things (IoT) stands out as the most frequently utilized platform (44.3 %), with disease diagnosis emerging as the predominant healthcare application (47.8 %). Notably, discussions center significantly on the prevention and identification of cardiovascular diseases (29.2 %). The studies under examination employ a diverse range of ML and DL methods, along with distributed systems, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) being the most commonly used (16.7 %), followed by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks (14.6 %) and shallow learning networks (12.5 %). In evaluating QoS, the predominant emphasis revolves around the accuracy parameter (80 %). This study highlights how ML, DL, and distributed systems reshape healthcare. It contributes to advancing healthcare quality, bridging the gap between technology and medical adoption, and benefiting practitioners and patients.",
