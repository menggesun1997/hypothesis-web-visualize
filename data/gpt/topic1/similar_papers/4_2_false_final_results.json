    "title": "Meta-Learned Adaptive Knowledge Graph Evolution for Dynamic Domains",
    "Problem_Statement": "Knowledge graph completion approaches overlook efficient adaptation to continuous domain shifts and rapidly evolving knowledge, resulting in outdated or incomplete representations that degrade LLM long-term reasoning.",
    "Motivation": "Targets internal gaps of incomplete and rapidly changing knowledge bases by deploying meta-learning methods (Opportunity 3) for dynamic, continual knowledge graph completion to maintain LLM memory currency and relevance.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a meta-learning framework where a base model learns to quickly adapt graph completion embeddings and structural features as new knowledge arrives. The model leverages few-shot updates to adjust representations with minimal data while maintaining stability, enabling real-time evolution of multi-modal knowledge graphs feeding into LLM memory modules.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect temporal knowledge graph datasets with staged domain shifts (e.g., DBpedia snapshots with updates). 2) Develop meta-learning graph embedding model (e.g., MAML variant). 3) Simulate continuous knowledge updates and measure adaptation speed and accuracy. 4) Evaluate downstream effects on LLM long-term reasoning tasks with updated knowledge ingestion. Baselines include standard retrained models and static embeddings.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Newly discovered facts about COVID-19 variants added incrementally. Expected Output: Model rapidly integrates new entities and relations into the knowledge graph enabling correct multi-hop inference on recent variant spread and vaccine impact without full retraining.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If meta-learning fails to produce stable adaptation, consider hybrid incremental retraining with knowledge distillation or memory replay techniques to preserve previously learned knowledge while integrating updates."
