    "title": "Hierarchical Memory Graph Networks for Multi-Hop Multi-Modal Reasoning in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing multi-modal graph completion models lack explicit hierarchical memory structures needed to support efficient multi-hop reasoning in LLMs with long-term knowledge retention.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gaps around multi-hop reasoning and integration with memory architectures by proposing hierarchical memory organization inspired by cognitive memory models, bridging to brain-inspired architectures (hidden bridge) and Opportunity 1.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hierarchical memory graph network architecture wherein a sequence of memory graphs with increasing abstraction levels are maintained. Lower levels capture detailed multi-modal factual knowledge while higher levels summarize and abstract context. LLMs query this memory hierarchy to conduct efficient multi-hop reasoning with both detailed and abstracted knowledge representation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Augment multi-modal knowledge graphs with hierarchical abstraction layers. 2) Implement memory graph network with trainable hierarchy-building modules. 3) Evaluate on benchmark multi-hop reasoning datasets combining text and images. 4) Compare reasoning accuracy, speed, and memory usage with flat memory approaches.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Query \"Trace the development of the smartphone integrating both technical and cultural perspectives.\" Output: A multi-hop reasoning path involving detailed technical specs at the base level and higher-level socio-cultural context from abstracted graph nodes, yielding comprehensive answers supported with images and text.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "In case hierarchical memory construction is ineffective, switch to flat multi-modal graph memories augmented by learned attention-based memory retrieval focusing on multi-hop paths."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed hierarchical memory graph network architecture conceptually aligns with cognitive memory models, the description lacks technical clarity on how the hierarchy-building modules are structured, trained, and integrated with LLM queries. Specific mechanisms detailing how abstraction levels are constructed, updated, and queried by the LLM for efficient multi-hop reasoning are needed to ensure soundness and reproducibility. Consider providing architectural diagrams, concrete algorithms, or pseudocode illustrating the memory graph formation, hierarchy transitions, and multipath reasoning processes across abstraction layers to strengthen the core mechanism and its validity (Proposed_Method). Please also clarify how multi-modal data modalities are aligned and represented uniformly within this graph hierarchy to support reasoning consistency and scalability without information loss or noise amplification. This will solidify confidence that the modelâ€™s core workings are well-founded and operationally feasible within current LLM frameworks rather than conceptually aspirational alone. Furthermore, discussing how hierarchical memory benefits over existing flat graph memory approaches at a detailed algorithmic level will bolster soundness claims and the novelty evaluation."

Strengthening the experimental plan by adding these concrete scientific and engineering details will greatly improve feasibility assessment and instill reviewer confidence that the proposed methodology can be systematically validated and iterated on, with meaningful empirical evidence supporting claimed contributions."
