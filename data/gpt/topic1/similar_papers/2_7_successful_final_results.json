        "title": "Physics-Informed Neural Prompt Modulation Anchored in Synaptic Plasticity Theory and Stress-Related Circuit Dynamics",
        "Problem_Statement": "Prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs) frequently relies on empirical tuning without principled, theoretically grounded mechanisms for adaptation. Existing neuroscience-inspired prompt methods often metaphorically invoke synaptic plasticity concepts without rigorous justification, leading to conceptual ambiguity and limited interpretability. This proposal addresses the foundational challenge of rigorously mapping theoretical physics models of synaptic potentiation—well-studied in computational neuroscience and neuropsychiatry—to neural prompt modulation parameters in high-dimensional embedding spaces. We clarify that our approach is not merely metaphorical but builds upon concrete mathematical analogies between energy-based synaptic models and constrained optimization frameworks in prompt tuning. Specifically, we delineate the assumptions and scope of this analogy, highlighting precedents where synaptic physics has successfully inspired novel machine learning regularization and energy-based architectures. Additionally, we integrate insights from computational neuropsychiatry and stress-related cortical circuits (e.g., dorsal anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex) associated with emotion and threat processing, which modulate synaptic plasticity dynamics underlying flexible learning. By grounding prompt adaptation in these rigorously supported theoretical frameworks, we aim to overcome oversimplification pitfalls and enhance both interpretability and robustness of LLM prompt tuning.",
        "Motivation": "While prior works have applied metaphorical synaptic plasticity concepts, our motivation is to bridge rigorous physics-based synaptic models with prompt adaptation to establish a mathematically principled and biologically informed framework. This provides a novel contribution beyond empirical prompt tuning by enabling adaptive, energy-constrained embedding modulation reflecting underlying neurobiological learning mechanisms. Moreover, by incorporating computational neuropsychiatry insights into circuits relevant for stress and emotional regulation—such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex—we target context-sensitive and emotionally salient prompt adaptation scenarios often underexplored in LLM research. This synergy uniquely positions our approach as both novel and competitive, contributing explainable, theoretically justified methods that enhance generalization and robustness in real-world knowledge base coordination.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a twofold methodological innovation: (1) Formulate prompt parameter updates as constrained optimization problems driven by energy functions explicitly derived from established biophysical synaptic potentiation models, such as spike-timing-dependent plasticity energy landscapes and synaptic metaplasticity frameworks. These energy functions are mathematically encoded using differentiable forms compatible with gradient-based prompt tuning, ensuring stable integration into current LLM training pipelines. (2) Extend these models by integrating computational neuropsychiatric frameworks that capture synaptic modulation dynamics within stress-related neural circuits (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex), informed by emotion theory and threat extinction mechanisms. This integration enables neural prompt modulation layers that dynamically adapt to context and emotional salience, improving responses to potential stressors or emotionally charged queries. The neural prompt modulation architecture explicitly models embedding trajectory constraints aligned with synaptic energy minima, with tuning dynamics inspired by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)-related plasticity enhancements. We emphasize a rigorous scope on the valid analogy between synaptic physics and prompt tuning parameters, explicitly modeling the limits of this mapping and clarifying that the approach is a principled physics-inspired framework rather than a literal biological replication.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Formalize synaptic physics models relevant to plasticity (e.g., energy functions from spike-timing-dependent plasticity and metaplasticity) as differentiable energy landscapes compatible with prompt embedding spaces; develop and verify mathematical equivalences and bounds ensuring stable optimization. 2) Implement neural prompt modulation layers constrained by these energy functions within established LLM architectures; incorporate regularization terms encoding stress-related circuit modulation inspired by computational neuropsychiatry findings to simulate emotional salience effects. 3) Design and select datasets containing contextually and emotionally charged retrieval tasks, including benchmarks reflecting stress- or emotion-related content (e.g., emotion-laden question answering, conversational agents responding to potential stressors). 4) Train LLMs using physics-informed prompt tuning versus baseline and state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods; evaluate using metrics emphasizing answer accuracy, stability (variance over repeated tuning runs), and generalization to novel emotional contexts. 5) Visualize embedding trajectories and energy function adherence during training; empirically validate that prompt embeddings converge near theoretical energy minima, confirming the analogy's validity. 6) Assess computational overhead and training stability; perform ablation studies on physics constraint complexity and neuropsychiatric-inspired modulation components to evaluate trade-offs. 7) If initial complexity proves prohibitive, apply fallback approximations such as regularization-based prompt constraint surrogates and meta-learning inspired by physics principles, systematically measuring performance degradation and training feasibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: A context-sensitive question with an emotionally nuanced component, e.g., \"How can exposure-based therapy alleviate responses to potential stressors related to major depressive disorder?\". Expected Output: Prompt embeddings adapt dynamically within the synaptic energy constraint framework, modulated by emotional salience modeled on relevant stress-related circuits, yielding accurate, context-aware, and emotionally informed explanatory answers that generalize beyond training contexts.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the explicit integration of synaptic physics constraints impairs training stability or computational feasibility, we will simplify by approximating synaptic dynamics through regularization schemes or meta-learning frameworks inspired by the underlying physics principles, such as learned gradient penalties enforcing energy function-like constraints. We will define clear evaluation metrics encompassing answer quality, prompt embedding stability, computational cost, and generalization to emotional contexts. Systematic benchmarking of these fallback methods against the full physics-informed model will provide insight into the trade-offs between biological fidelity, interpretability, and practical feasibility. Additionally, we will explore fine-tuning hyperparameters inspired by transcranial direct current stimulation protocols to enhance plasticity analogs with reduced model complexity."

Neuroscience concepts are often metaphorical or phenomenological and might not straightforwardly map to high-dimensional LLM embedding spaces or prompt tuning parameters. The proposal should clarify and justify the validity and limits of this analogy to avoid potential conceptual pitfalls, and delineate whether the approach is metaphor-inspired or aiming for a rigorous biophysical ground truth correspondence. Without this clarity, the core premise risks being undermined by oversimplification or misapplication of synaptic theories to machine learning prompt mechanisms, compromising soundness and interpretability.

For example, the proposal lacks specification on the mathematical forms of energy functions, how these can be integrated into or constrain gradient-based prompt tuning, and how model training stability will be ensured despite added constraints. The fallback plan is a good start but can be strengthened by predefining evaluation metrics aligned with trade-offs of these simplifications. Additionally, practical concerns such as computational costs, dataset selection for contextual retrieval tasks, and baseline comparison details should be explicitly addressed to prevent the risk of infeasible implementation or inconclusive validation. Strengthen Experiment_Plan by elaborating on exact experimental setups, algorithmic frameworks, optimization procedures, and evaluation metrics to enhance reproducibility and clarity of feasibility assessments."
