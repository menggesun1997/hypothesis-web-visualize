    "title": "Physics-Informed Neural Prompt Modulation Anchored in Synaptic Plasticity Theory",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM prompt engineering lacks principled approaches inspired by theoretical physics models of synaptic potentiation, leading to ad-hoc tuning rather than mathematically grounded adaptation mechanisms.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to internal and external gaps by grounding prompt modulation techniques in theoretically derived physics frameworks of synaptic plasticity, bridging advanced studies cluster and neurobiological insights.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Formulate prompt parameter updates as a constrained optimization problem governed by energy functions derived from synaptic potentiation physics. Translate these into differentiable neural prompt modulation layers that adapt embeddings consonant with synaptic weight dynamics, enabling robust context-specific learning and knowledge base coordination.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Encode synaptic physics models as energy minimization objectives. 2) Implement prompt modulation layers in neural pipelines. 3) Train LLMs on contextual retrieval tasks with physics-informed prompt adaptation. 4) Measure improvements over standard prompt tuning in terms of stability and generalization. 5) Visualize prompt embedding trajectories relating to theoretical energy landscapes.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Context-sensitive question requiring flexible knowledge base recall. Expected output: Prompt embeddings adaptively modulated per synaptic energy constraints, yielding more accurate answers.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If physics-based constraints impede training, simplify models by approximating synaptic dynamics via regularization or use meta-learning for prompt parameter adaptation inspired by physics principles."

          "feedback_content": "The foundational assumption that synaptic plasticity physics models can be directly and effectively translated into prompt modulation mechanisms for large language models needs stronger theoretical justification and clearer linkage. Neuroscience concepts are often metaphorical or phenomenological and might not straightforwardly map to high-dimensional LLM embedding spaces or prompt tuning parameters. The proposal should clarify and justify the validity and limits of this analogy to avoid potential conceptual pitfalls, and delineate whether the approach is metaphor-inspired or aiming for a rigorous biophysical ground truth correspondence. Without this clarity, the core premise risks being undermined by oversimplification or misapplication of synaptic theories to machine learning prompt mechanisms, compromising soundness and interpretability. Please expand on this in the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections with concrete theoretical or empirical support backing the assumed analogy and mapping approach, possibly referencing prior successful physics-to-ML method translations or limitations identified therein.\n\n"

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "While the stepwise experimental plan outlines a logical progression, it requires more concrete methodological details to ensure feasibility, especially regarding encoding complex synaptic physics as energy functions compatible with differentiable prompt layers. For example, the proposal lacks specification on the mathematical forms of energy functions, how these can be integrated into or constrain gradient-based prompt tuning, and how model training stability will be ensured despite added constraints. The fallback plan is a good start but can be strengthened by predefining evaluation metrics aligned with trade-offs of these simplifications. Additionally, practical concerns such as computational costs, dataset selection for contextual retrieval tasks, and baseline comparison details should be explicitly addressed to prevent the risk of infeasible implementation or inconclusive validation. Strengthen Experiment_Plan by elaborating on exact experimental setups, algorithmic frameworks, optimization procedures, and evaluation metrics to enhance reproducibility and clarity of feasibility assessments."
