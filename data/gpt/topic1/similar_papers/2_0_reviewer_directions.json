    "title": "Neuro-Cognitive Episodic Context Modeling for LLM Prompt Optimization",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs struggle to dynamically incorporate episodic context resembling human memory consolidation, limiting their effective use of knowledge bases during few-shot learning. This gap reduces model adaptability and knowledge transfer in complex tasks.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of missing integration between computational cognitive models of episodic memory and neurocognitive frameworks, fulfilling Opportunity 1 by fusing human-like context encoding mechanisms in LLM prompt engineering to enhance long-term memory leverage.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid cognitive-LSTM module that simulates episodic memory encoding and consolidation processes associated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity. This module generates context-aware prompt embeddings that are dynamically updated through synthetic sleep-like consolidation phases using replay mechanisms inspired by neurocognitive models. Integrate this module into prompt engineering pipelines for LLM few-shot tasks, enabling the model to better stabilize and retrieve relevant knowledge snippets from external knowledge bases.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect cognitive task datasets with episodic memory annotations (e.g., EMERGE dataset). 2) Implement the cognitive-LSTM model simulating episodic encoding and sleep-phase replay. 3) Integrate module outputs as prompt embeddings for GPT-4/PaLM on knowledge-intensive few-shot tasks. 4) Compare performance with standard few-shot prompting baselines on metrics like accuracy, context retention, and knowledge retrieval. 5) Ablate replay mechanism and context compression to assess contributions.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Given a medical case description, generate a diagnosis considering previous cases in this patientâ€™s episodic memory.\" Expected output: A diagnosis that references prior related cases encoded and consolidated by the episodic module, demonstrating context-aware knowledge integration beyond shallow prompt matching.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If the episodic LSTM module fails to improve context retention, pivot to a transformer-based episodic encoder using attention to model context relationships, or incorporate neuro-symbolic memory graph structures to explicitly store episodic memories for prompt augmentation."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method currently lacks sufficient technical clarity regarding how the cognitive-LSTM module concretely simulates dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity and how synthetic sleep-like replay phases will be operationalized computationally. Clearer elaboration is needed on the internal LSTM architecture, the nature of episodic encoding representations, and how replay and consolidation phases interact with prompt embeddings. Without precise mechanistic descriptions, reproducibility and assessment of biological plausibility are difficult, weakening both soundness and feasibility claims. Consider providing a detailed computational model sketch or pseudo-code to clarify these mechanisms upfront, which will aid validation and implementation phases outlined downstream in the plan. This clarity is critical to convince reviewers of the conceptual and technical grounding of the neuro-cognitive simulation approach proposed for prompt optimization methods in LLMs. Target this feedback primarily to the Proposed_Method section for refinement and elaboration to enhance methodological rigor and reproducibility potential."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and the strong existing work overlaps in neuro-inspired LLM prompt engineering, a promising avenue to broaden impact and increase competitive edge is to explicitly connect the episodic context modeling framework to broader AGI themes. Integrate insights from cognitive models of decision making by enabling the episodic module not only to consolidate but also to influence LLM reasoning decisions dynamically during few-shot inference. This could position the work toward artificial general intelligence by modeling context-dependent decision pathways rather than static prompt improvements. Suggest augmenting the methodology with experiments that measure improvements in decision-making quality or adaptability on benchmark AGI-related tasks. Such an integration will leverage the 'cognitive models of decision making' global concept, potentially elevating the work from prompt engineering to advancing more generalizable intelligence architectures, enhancing both novelty and long-term impact. Emphasize this suggestion to expand the Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan sections accordingly."
