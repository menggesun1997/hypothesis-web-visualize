    "title": "Physiological Signal-Guided Few-Shot Learning in LLM Training Pipelines",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM few-shot learning overlooks physiological and movement data that affect human learning and memory stabilization, missing auxiliary signals that could improve model learning dynamics and robustness.",
    "Motivation": "Targets external/novel gaps by integrating physiological and behavioral metrics from health surveys into LLM few-shot learning processes (Opportunity 2), simulating more realistic human memory stabilization and adaptive encoding.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Augment few-shot learning datasets with synchronized physiological signals (e.g., actigraphy, heart rate variability) and cognitive effort indices. Design a multi-modal learning framework where the LLM prompt embeddings are modulated by these physiological embeddings through cross-modal attention layers to simulate cognitive effort and memory consolidation effects dynamically, refining prompt context and improving sample efficiency.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Source multimodal datasets pairing text tasks with physiological monitoring (e.g., sleep and cognition datasets). 2) Train multi-modal embedding encoders for physiological signals. 3) Develop a cross-modal attention LLM fine-tuning pipeline integrating physiological embeddings into prompts. 4) Evaluate against standard few-shot performance on datasets like MMLU and Natural Questions, measuring accuracy, learning speed, and generalization. 5) Analyze physiological feature importance and correlation with model gains.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Translate technical text with cognitive load data indicating high fatigue.\" Expected output: Translation output adjusted for context complexity and errors minimized, mimicking adaptive human performance modulation under fatigue conditions.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If physiological signals are noisy or ineffective, substitute with synthetic cognitive effort proxies derived from task difficulty or simulated attention decay models. Alternatively, focus on refining the embedding fusion strategies or use domain adaptation techniques to better integrate modalities."
