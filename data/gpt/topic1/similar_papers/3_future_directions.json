        "title": "Community-Grounded Multimodal Knowledge Bases for LLM Fairness",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs suffer from bias due to underrepresentation of socio-economic and ethnically diverse communities, especially in conflict-affected and economically fragile settings. There is a lack of integrative frameworks combining fiscal decentralization, public health data, and community participation to mitigate bias in LLM outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient integration of distributed systems with domain-specific knowledge bases and the external gap of missing community participation frameworks. This aligns with Opportunity 1 from the landscape map, leveraging hidden bridges between economic governance, health surveillance, and community participation to improve fairness.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel AI-driven multimodal knowledge base that fuses datasets on fiscal decentralization policies, infectious disease surveillance, and community engagement metrics (e.g., participatory governance surveys). Use graph neural networks (GNNs) to contextualize relationships between economic policies and health outcomes at local levels. Integrate this knowledge base with LLM prompting mechanisms to enforce fairness-aware response constraints, ensuring representation and mitigating ethnic and socio-economic bias.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets: fiscal decentralization indicators, health surveillance records, community participation surveys from conflict and post-conflict zones. 2) Construct a multimodal knowledge graph combining these datasets with socio-economic and ethnic features. 3) Train GNN encoders on this graph to learn latent representations. 4) Fine-tune LLMs with augmented context injection from the knowledge base. Baselines: standard LLMs without knowledge base. Metrics: fairness metrics (Demographic Parity, Equalized Odds), factuality, bias reduction, model calibration.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What measures should be prioritized to control a disease outbreak in a conflict-affected region with diverse ethnic groups?\" Expected Output: \"Prioritize community-led surveillance combined with decentralized fiscal support ensuring equitable resource allocation to underserved ethnic communities, mitigating historical biases seen in previous interventions.\"",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If GNN integration underperforms, fallback to simpler rule-based knowledge injection based on community participation thresholds. Alternatively, enrich datasets with synthetic minority data augmentation or incorporate human-in-the-loop fine-tuning to improve fairness outcomes."

        "title": "SDG-Constrained Prompt Engineering for Bias Mitigation in LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLMs applied in socioeconomically diverse, conflict-affected populations reflect biased reasoning that ignores Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and human development benchmarks in decision processes, amplifying ethnic and migration-related disparities.",
        "Motivation": "Tackles the external gap of integrating SDGs and human development indicators into LLM fairness frameworks, addressing Opportunity 2 by embedding global policy constraints into AI reasoning, thus linking global goals with local conflict and health challenges.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a prompt engineering framework that injects SDG-based contextual fairness constraints directly into LLM decoding. This involves creating a modular prompt template embedding policy guidelines, fairness criteria derived from SDGs (e.g., reduced inequalities, good health), and demographic sensitivity modules. Develop a plug-and-play adapter layer to dynamically enforce these constraints during generation, ensuring outputs align with equity and fairness objectives in conflict-affected narratives and policy recommendations.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Extract textual SDG guidelines and policy frameworks relevant to health and economic development. 2) Create prompt templates incorporating fairness constraints. 3) Implement adapter layers in LLM architectures to condition outputs on these constraints. 4) Evaluate on datasets with socioeconomically and ethnically diverse scenarios (e.g., policy documents, health advisories). Baselines: vanilla LLMs without constraints. Metrics: bias metrics (e.g., subgroup accuracy), adherence to SDG goals, human evaluation of fairness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Advise on allocating health resources in a multi-ethnic post-conflict region.\" Output: \"Allocate resources prioritizing marginalized ethnic groups to reduce health disparities, ensure sustainable economic development per SDG targets.\"",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If prompt-constrained decoding fails, fallback to post-processing output filtering based on fairness classifiers, or use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to teach adherence to SDG-aligned fairness policies."

        "title": "Distributed AI-Augmented Fiscal Decentralization Knowledge Base for Explainable LLM Policies",
        "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of dynamic, explainable knowledge bases combining distributed AI models (CNNs, LSTMs) with fiscal decentralization governance data to support equitable decision-making by LLMs in health resource allocation, limiting trust and adoption in conflict settings.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the critical internal gap of integrating distributed AI with governance data, and builds on Opportunity 3 by creating explainable, policy-relevant knowledge enhancements to LLMs, bridging technical and policy domains.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a distributed knowledge framework that incorporates time-series health surveillance modeled by LSTMs, spatial governance data modeled by CNNs over geographic maps, and fiscal decentralization metrics. Use these outputs to populate an explainable, layered knowledge base linked to LLM query modules. Implement attention-based mechanisms within the LLM to surface governance-informed explanations for resource allocation outputs, aiding transparency and fairness.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect time-series epidemic and fiscal decentralization data from target regions. 2) Train CNN models on spatial governance maps; train LSTMs on temporal health data. 3) Aggregate AI outputs into a multi-layered knowledge base with provenance metadata. 4) Fine-tune LLMs with access to this knowledge base via retrieval-augmented generation with explanation tokens. Baselines: LLMs without explainable knowledge. Metrics: prediction accuracy, explainability scores (human evaluation), fairness metrics.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Recommend budget distribution to control infectious diseases in a conflict zone.\" Output: \"Allocating 40% budget to community health centers in underfunded districts, as indicated by spatial governance CNN and temporal health trends LSTM, ensures equitable disease response.\"",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If joint CNN-LSTM integration proves too complex, fallback to uni-modal knowledge bases (only LSTM on health data) with manually encoded fiscal rules. Alternatively, decouple explainability from knowledge base and provide post-hoc explanations via model-agnostic tools like SHAP or LIME."

        "title": "Cross-Domain AI Framework for Fiscal Health Policy Alignment Using LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current AI applications insufficiently integrate economic governance and infectious disease response data within LLMs, missing cross-disciplinary synergies critical for bias mitigation in fragile socio-political contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the external novel gap of cross-disciplinary integration across economic policy, conflict settings, and health tech, developing a framework that unifies these domains for fairness-aware LLM outputs, inspired by hidden bridge insights.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a hybrid reasoning system combining probabilistic graphical models encoding economic governance dependencies and infectious disease models with LLM-based natural language reasoning. The framework will enable coherent alignment of fiscal decentralization policies with health intervention strategies. It includes bias-detection modules analyzing socio-political contextual signals to adjust LLM responses dynamically.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop probabilistic models of fiscal policy impacts on health outcomes using real-world data. 2) Integrate these models with LLMs via a controller module that conditions language generation on probabilistic outputs. 3) Train bias detectors on historical policy documents reflecting socio-political disparities. 4) Evaluate on cross-domain scenarios requiring economic-health policy synthesis. Metrics: policy coherence, fairness, and factuality.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Suggest fiscal measures to improve epidemic control in economically decentralized conflict zones.\" Output: \"Increase local health spending through fiscal decentralization mechanisms shown probabilistically to improve epidemic outcomes, ensuring marginalized groups receive equitable funding.\"",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If probabilistic integration hinders real-time generation, revert to a pipelined approach where LLMs post-process outputs from separate economic and health models. Alternatively, simplify bias detectors using heuristic rules."

        "title": "Participatory Surveillance Data Augmentation for Bias-Resistant LLM Health Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "Insufficient incorporation of community participation data in health surveillance leads to biased LLM health models that underrepresent vulnerable populations' perspectives, reducing adoption and fairness in conflict-affected regions.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal and external gaps related to technology adoption and community participation integration, expanding Opportunity 1 by innovating on data augmentation with participatory surveillance inputs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a data augmentation pipeline that integrates crowd-sourced participatory health surveillance reports (e.g., community mobile health inputs) into LLM training corpora. Employ privacy-preserving algorithms to safely include sensitive data. Additionally, design bias-correction layers that recalibrate LLM outputs based on demographic participation rates to mitigate over- or under-representation in generated responses.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect participatory surveillance data from digital platforms in conflict zones. 2) Anonymize and preprocess data to integrate with existing public health corpora. 3) Fine-tune LLMs on augmented datasets with bias-correction objectives. 4) Benchmark against LLMs trained on non-augmented datasets using fairness and representation metrics.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What are the main barriers faced by ethnic minorities in disease reporting in conflict areas?\" Output: \"Barriers include mistrust in authorities and lack of accessible digital tools, as reported by community-driven surveillance data, highlighting need for inclusive outreach.\"",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If direct data augmentation causes model degradation, employ synthetic minority oversampling techniques or implement transfer learning from community participation classifiers to guide LLM fine-tuning."
