    "title": "Cross-Modal Adversarial Augmentation for Enhanced Foundation Model Adaptation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Fine-tuning foundation models on scarce, heterogeneous domain-specific multi-modal data leads to poor robustness and generalization especially when distribution shifts occur between training and deployment.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the external gap by applying adversarial augmentation techniques, missing in current domain-specific fine-tuning, but proven beneficial in general domain adaptation, to multi-modal knowledge embeddings bridging modalities for better domain robustness.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a cross-modal adversarial augmentation pipeline that generates perturbations simultaneously in text, image, and structured knowledge embeddings during fine-tuning. Perturbations respect modality-specific constraints and jointly maximize the model's loss to improve robustness to real-world domain shifts. Integrate contrastive losses to maintain semantic alignment across modalities post-perturbation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather multi-modal domain datasets (e.g., clinical reports with imaging and tabular data). 2) Pretrain/fine-tune foundation LLMs with domain knowledge embeddings. 3) Implement cross-modal adversarial perturbation generators and contrastive alignment losses. 4) Compare performance and robustness versus traditional fine-tuning methods without adversarial augmentation. 5) Test generalization on shifted target sets and evaluate via robustness metrics and downstream task scores.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical case report text combined with chest x-rays and lab results under varying imaging acquisition conditions. Expected Output: Consistent diagnosis predictions robust to modality-specific perturbations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If joint adversarial perturbations cause training instability, adopt a sequential or isolated modality-wise adversarial augmentation strategy and incorporate gradient regularization techniques."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-MECHANISM",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed cross-modal adversarial augmentation pipeline lacks clarity on how perturbations are jointly optimized across heterogeneous modalities while respecting distinct constraints. The precise algorithmic details of generating and integrating these perturbations, as well as how the contrastive loss effectively preserves semantic alignment post-perturbation, should be more explicitly articulated to ensure the mechanism is well-grounded and reproducible. Without this, the soundness of the methodological approach remains uncertain, particularly given the complexity of simultaneous adversarial intervention in multiple embedding spaces that differ substantially in structure and characteristics (text, image, and structured knowledge). Clarifying these components will strengthen the researchâ€™s internal validity and provide a clearer foundation for implementation and evaluation efforts in the experiment plan, reducing the risk of ambiguous outcomes or stability issues during training as anticipated in the fallback plan.\n\nRecommendation: Elaborate on the adversarial perturbation generation process, the joint optimization strategy, and the formulation of the contrastive loss with respect to modality-specific embedding spaces and overall model loss maximization, ideally providing equations or pseudocode to concretize the approach in the Proposed_Method section."

Additionally, the plan does not discuss baselines or ablations that isolate the impact of each component (e.g., modality-specific adversarial perturbations versus joint perturbations, and contrastive loss versus no contrastive loss). This raises concerns about reproducibility and the validity of claims around improved robustness and generalization.\n\nFurthermore, the fallback plan to sequential or isolated modality-wise augmentation implies potential instability risks with the main approach but does not specify how stability or convergence will be monitored or mitigated experimentally.\n\nRecommendation: Strengthen the Experiment_Plan section by specifying dataset characteristics, evaluation metrics (including robustness metrics), control experiments, baseline comparisons, and stability monitoring protocols to ensure the feasibility and scientific soundness of the evaluation framework."
