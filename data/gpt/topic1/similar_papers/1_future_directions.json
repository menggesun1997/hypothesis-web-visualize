        "Problem_Statement": "Current fine-tuning methods for domain-specific LLMs struggle with robustness and trustworthiness when handling complex industrial multi-modal data, leading to performance degradation under domain shifts and heterogeneous scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of lacking robustness and trustworthiness in fine-tuned models for multi-modal industrial data by integrating adversarial data augmentation and domain adaptation, identified as a global hidden bridge absent from current local research clusters.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel adversarial domain adaptation framework that incorporates adversarial perturbations specific to industrial multi-modal inputs (e.g., sensor readings, text logs, images) during fine-tuning of foundation LLMs enhanced with domain knowledge embeddings. This framework will feature: a) a domain discriminator trained adversarially to distinguish between source and target domains, b) adversarial augmentation modules generating challenging perturbed inputs, and c) integration with multi-modal embedding fusion layers to maintain coherent domain-specific semantic representations.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect and preprocess multi-modal industrial datasets involving sensor data, textual logs, and images with diverse domain distributions. 2) Initialize a general foundation LLM with domain-specific knowledge embeddings. 3) Implement the adversarial domain adaptation training regime incorporating adversarial augmentations. 4) Compare against baseline fine-tuning without adversarial adaptation. 5) Evaluate performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score for classification, domain generalization robustness measures, and trustworthiness via uncertainty quantification on held-out target distributions.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multi-sensor readings and machine logs simulating a new industrial environment with different sensor noise profiles. Expected Output: Correct classification of machine state anomalies robust to domain shifts, with uncertainty confidence scores indicating trustworthy predictions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If adversarial adaptation does not yield improvements, fallback to domain-invariant feature learning approaches such as CORAL loss or Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Additionally, analyze and tune adversarial perturbation strengths and employ simpler augmentation strategies such as noise injection."
