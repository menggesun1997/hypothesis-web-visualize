    "title": "Multimodal Scene Graph Fusion for Adaptive Knowledge Retrieval",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current retrieval-augmented generation systems suffer from limited synergy between retriever and generator components and poor relational attribute modeling, especially when dealing with multi-granular contexts involving multimodal data. This impairs the effective incorporation of external knowledge into LLMs, hindering explainability and performance in complex tasks.",
    "Motivation": "This idea targets internal gaps (a) and (b) by introducing an integrated multimodal scene graph fusion mechanism within adaptive fusion layers, inspired by Opportunity 1 which suggests leveraging vision-language model advances and scene graph generation to improve relational reasoning and knowledge incorporation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a unified architecture that constructs joint multimodal scene graphs from visual inputs and textual knowledge sources. The fusion layers adaptively select and integrate these graph-based relational contexts with retrieval-augmented generation by tightly coupling retriever and generator via shared embedding spaces learned end-to-end. This entails a cross-modal attention mechanism connecting knowledge graph nodes with PLM tokens, enabling dynamic context augmentation during decoding with relational awareness.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset: Use multimodal knowledge-intensive datasets such as KnowledgeVQA, WebQA with annotated graphs, and domain-specific biomedical image-text corpora. 2) Models: Base PLM (e.g., T5 or GPT), pretrained vision-language encoders, scene graph generators. 3) Baselines: Current RAG frameworks with disjoint retriever-generator, adapter-based infusion models. 4) Metrics: Knowledge relevance (precision/recall), downstream task accuracy (QA, summarization), explainability scores (graph alignment), and ablation of fusion layers. 5) Train end-to-end with joint losses enforcing retrieval fidelity and generative fluency.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A chest X-ray image and the question, \"What abnormal findings and relational structures are seen in the lungs?\" Expected Output: A generated radiology report describing abnormalities (e.g., \"diffuse ground-glass opacities in the left upper lung lobe, adjacent to consolidated regions\"), annotated with scene graph structures reflecting spatial relationships, enhancing explanation and clinical relevance.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If full multimodal joint training proves unstable, fallback to modular pretraining of vision-language scene graphs followed by frozen integration during RAG training. Alternatively, simplify fusion layers to gated multimodal attention without full graph representation. Perform error analysis to isolate bottlenecks in retrieval vs. generation components."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method’s description outlines ambitious integration of multimodal scene graphs with retrieval-augmented generation via joint embedding spaces and cross-modal attention. However, the explanation lacks detail on how the fusion layers dynamically balance and select among graph nodes and PLM tokens in practice, and how the end-to-end training handles potential conflicts between retrieval fidelity and generative fluency objectives. Strengthening clarity on these architectural and training dynamics—possibly with schematic illustrations or intermediate representation examples—would greatly improve soundness and reproducibility of the approach, helping reviewers and practitioners to fully grasp the mechanism's feasibility and novelty compared to prior tightly-coupled RAG variants and VL models with scene graph inputs. Clarify how relational awareness is quantitatively enforced and how multimodal graphs are aligned embedding-wise during decoding steps as well, to solidify the technical foundation of the mechanism proposed in the methodology section."

          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screened novelty status as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the globally linked concepts involving 'cross-modal retrieval', 'retrieval system', 'growth of multi-modal data', 'e-commerce', and 'semi-supervised learning paradigm', the proposal could be significantly enhanced by incorporating semi-supervised or self-supervised learning techniques to better leverage vast unlabeled multimodal web data, potentially beyond biomedical or QA datasets. Furthermore, extending the application scenarios toward high-value domains like e-commerce product retrieval or recommendation systems could broaden the impact and novelty. Integrating advanced cross-modal retrieval strategies from e-commerce or leveraging semi-supervised paradigms might make the adaptive fusion layers more robust and scalable, reinforcing both novelty and practical relevance, thereby addressing the crowdedness of the current RAG+scene graph niche with a distinctive real-world edge and technical strength."
