Despite significant advancements in various fields, existing general foundation models face challenges in industry when dealing with the data of specialized modalities, the tasks of varying-scenario with multiple processes, and the requirements of trustworthy output, which makes industrial foundation model (IFM) a necessity. This article proposes a system architecture of termed IFMsys, including model training, model adaptation, and model application. Specifically, in model training, a base model is constructed by pretraining on multimodal industrial data and fine-tuning with fundamental industrial mechanisms. In model adaptation, the base model is developed into a series of task-oriented and domain-specific IFMs through fine-tuning with representative tasks and domain knowledge. In model application, an industrial agent-centric collaboration system and a comprehensive application framework of IFM are proposed to enhance the industrial product lifecycle applications. In addition, a prototype system of the IFM, namely, MetaIndux, is delivered, with application examples presented in typical industrial tasks. Finally, future research directions and open issues of IFM are prospected.

A contextual word embedding similarity approach is adopted using BERT base variant models such as ClinicalBERT, DistilBERT, and SCIBERT to automatically classify the unlabeled clinical concept into explicit categories. Additionally, deep learning and large language model (LLM) are trained on acquiring label data through active learning.\\nResults: Using i2b2 datasets (426 clinical notes), the lexical-based method achieved precision, recall, and F1-scores of 76%, 70%, and 73%. SCIBERT excelled in active transfer learning, yielding precision of 70.84%, recall of 77.40%, F1-score of 73.97%, and accuracy of 69.30%, surpassing counterpart models. Among deep learning models, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with embeddings (BERTBase, DistilBERT, SCIBERT, ClinicalBERT) achieved training accuracies of 92-95% and testing accuracies of 89-93%. These results were higher compared to other deep learning models. Additionally, we individually evaluated these LLMs; among them, ClinicalBERT achieved the highest performance, with a training accuracy of 98.4% and a testing accuracy of 96%, outperforming the others.\\nConclusions: The proposed methodology enhances clinical concept extraction by integrating active learning and models like SCIBERT and CNN. It improves annotation efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, showcasing potential for clinical applications.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton (Analysis of the 10 papers)\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the 10 papers.

    "title": "Fine-Tuning LLMs with Knowledge Base Embeddings for Domain-Specific Expertise: Landscape Map",
    "current_research_landscape": "The core research cluster addresses the challenge of adapting large foundation models, such as general-purpose LLMs, towards domain-specific tasks requiring specialized knowledge and modalities. Central problems revolve around effective model training and adaptation processes to incorporate domain knowledge and ensure robust generalization within specialized industrial or clinical settings. Dominant methods include pretraining base models on multimodal datasets combined with fine-tuning using domain-specific knowledge and representative tasks. Deep learning architectures, particularly convolutional neural networks and transformer-based models like BERT variants (ClinicalBERT, SCIBERT), are prevalent for embedding domain knowledge and performing classification tasks within the target domain. The thematic islands reveal two primary paradigms: one focused on generalizable foundation models enhanced via domain knowledge transfer, and another emphasizing the role of deep learning model architectures enabling concept extraction and classification performance improvements.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: The analyzed papers acknowledge that while fine-tuning with domain knowledge improves performance, challenges remain in handling specialized modalities and multi-process industrial scenarios, limiting the trustworthiness and robustness of output. The absence of bridge nodes in the local knowledge skeleton suggests a current lack of integration or cross-talk between the 'model training/adaptation/domain knowledge' cluster and the 'deep learning architectures' cluster, indicating siloed approaches without sufficient methodological fusion. External/Novel Gaps: The global GPS analysis reveals a significant hidden bridge between 'generalization ability' and 'deep learning models', connecting concepts such as domain generalization, adversarial data augmentation, multi-task learning, and domain adaptationâ€”all underexplored in the local cluster. Specifically, techniques from domain adaptation and adversarial augmentation prevalent in broader machine learning fields are missing from the current discourse on domain-specific fine-tuning of foundation models. Leveraging these concepts could address local limitations regarding scarce target domain data, distributional shifts, and robustness, by enhancing model generalization and trustworthiness across domain discrepancies.",
