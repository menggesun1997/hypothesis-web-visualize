    "title": "Multi-Modal Bridge Nodes Discovery for Enhanced Knowledge Graph Integration",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing multi-modal knowledge graphs exhibit fragmented local concept networks lacking bridge nodes that connect core sub-themes, impeding holistic reasoning and graph completion.",
    "Motivation": "Explicitly targets the internal gap of absent bridge nodes and poor theme integration by introducing a novel methodology for discovering and synthesizing multi-modal bridge nodes enabling enriched connectivity and reasoning pathways, addressing a critical bottleneck in knowledge graph learning.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an unsupervised multi-modal embedding alignment and bridging algorithm that identifies weakly connected but semantically aligned nodes across subgraphs by jointly analyzing textual, visual, and structural graph signals. The identified bridge nodes are synthesized or augmented to form new linking concepts improving graph connectivity and enabling efficient multi-hop navigation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select fragmented multi-modal knowledge graphs with annotated sub-themes. 2) Implement the bridge node discovery and augmentation algorithm. 3) Evaluate increase in connectivity metrics, improvement in downstream reasoning (multi-hop accuracy), and completeness of graph representations. 4) Compare with baseline nearest neighbor or co-occurrence linking methods.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Two subgraphs on medical imaging and diagnostic text data with sparse links. Output: Synthesized bridge nodes linking visual features with textual diagnostic concepts, enabling multi-hop queries spanning both subgraphs.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If unsupervised bridging is noisy, incorporate human-in-the-loop or weak supervision signals or restrict bridge discovery to high-confidence semantic overlaps only."
