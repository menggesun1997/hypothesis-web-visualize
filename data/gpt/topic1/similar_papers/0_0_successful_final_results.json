    "title": "Multimodal Scene Graph Fusion for Adaptive Knowledge Retrieval",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current retrieval-augmented generation systems suffer from limited synergy between retriever and generator components and poor relational attribute modeling, especially when dealing with multi-granular contexts involving multimodal data. This impairs the effective incorporation of external knowledge into LLMs, hindering explainability and performance in complex tasks.",
    "Motivation": "This idea targets internal gaps (a) and (b) by introducing an integrated multimodal scene graph fusion mechanism within adaptive fusion layers, inspired by Opportunity 1 which suggests leveraging vision-language model advances and scene graph generation to improve relational reasoning and knowledge incorporation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a unified architecture that constructs joint multimodal scene graphs from visual inputs and textual knowledge sources. The fusion layers adaptively select and integrate these graph-based relational contexts with retrieval-augmented generation by tightly coupling retriever and generator via shared embedding spaces learned end-to-end. This entails a cross-modal attention mechanism connecting knowledge graph nodes with PLM tokens, enabling dynamic context augmentation during decoding with relational awareness.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset: Use multimodal knowledge-intensive datasets such as KnowledgeVQA, WebQA with annotated graphs, and domain-specific biomedical image-text corpora. 2) Models: Base PLM (e.g., T5 or GPT), pretrained vision-language encoders, scene graph generators. 3) Baselines: Current RAG frameworks with disjoint retriever-generator, adapter-based infusion models. 4) Metrics: Knowledge relevance (precision/recall), downstream task accuracy (QA, summarization), explainability scores (graph alignment), and ablation of fusion layers. 5) Train end-to-end with joint losses enforcing retrieval fidelity and generative fluency.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A chest X-ray image and the question, \"What abnormal findings and relational structures are seen in the lungs?\" Expected Output: A generated radiology report describing abnormalities (e.g., \"diffuse ground-glass opacities in the left upper lung lobe, adjacent to consolidated regions\"), annotated with scene graph structures reflecting spatial relationships, enhancing explanation and clinical relevance.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If full multimodal joint training proves unstable, fallback to modular pretraining of vision-language scene graphs followed by frozen integration during RAG training. Alternatively, simplify fusion layers to gated multimodal attention without full graph representation. Perform error analysis to isolate bottlenecks in retrieval vs. generation components."

        "title": "Semi-Supervised Multimodal Scene Graph Fusion for Robust Adaptive Knowledge Retrieval",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems struggle with limited synergy between retriever and generator modules, especially when modeling complex relational attributes across multi-granular and multimodal contexts. This limitation hampers effective integration of external knowledge into large language models (LLMs), reducing explainability and task performance. Moreover, current approaches often rely on fully supervised datasets, limiting scalability across diverse domains such as e-commerce where multimodal data is abundant but sparsely labeled.",
        "Motivation": "Our proposal addresses core limitations in RAG by deeply integrating multimodal scene graphs with adaptive fusion mechanisms, emphasizing clear architectural design and training strategies for dynamic relational context modeling. Unlike prior works with loosely coupled modules, we enforce explicit embedding-level alignment and cross-modal attention between graph nodes and PLM tokens, while incorporating semi-supervised learning to harness vast unlabeled multimodal data. This integration advances beyond existing competitive methods by resolving training conflicts, dynamically balancing modalities, and extending applicability to high-impact domains like e-commerce product retrieval and recommendation, bridging the novelty gap and enhancing practical relevance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We introduce a novel, semi-supervised multimodal scene graph fusion architecture that tightly couples retrieval and generation through shared embedding spaces and dynamic fusion layers, detailed as follows:\n\n1) Scene Graph Construction: Generate joint scene graphs from multimodal inputs (images, text) via pretrained vision-language encoders and scene graph generators.\n\n2) Embedding Alignment: Learn unified embeddings for graph nodes and PLM tokens using a contrastive alignment loss, ensuring cross-modal semantic consistency during decoding.\n\n3) Adaptive Fusion Layers: Incorporate gating-based cross-modal attention modules that dynamically weigh and select information from graph nodes and PLM token sequences at each decoding step. Fusion weights are conditioned on context embeddings and retrieval confidence scores, allowing fine-grained balancing between relational context and language fluency.\n\n4) Semi-Supervised Training Paradigm: Leverage multimodal web-scale unlabeled datasets with a consistency-based loss enforcing stable fusion outputs under augmentations, and pseudo-label scene graph edges to expand supervised signals. This enables scalable learning beyond fully annotated corpora.\n\n5) End-to-End Optimization: Jointly optimize retrieval fidelity and generative fluency objectives with carefully designed loss scheduling and gradient blending to mitigate conflicts. Intermediate representations (e.g., attention maps over graph nodes) are supervised to enforce relational awareness quantitatively.\n\n6) Cross-Domain Application: Extend evaluation to e-commerce multimodal product search and recommendation, integrating advanced cross-modal retrieval strategies (e.g., momentum encoders, memory queues) to improve scalability and robustness.\n\nWe will provide schematic diagrams illustrating fusion and training workflows, and share intermediate embeddings and attention visualizations to ensure reproducibility and clarity.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Datasets: Combine multimodal knowledge-intensive datasets (KnowledgeVQA, WebQA, biomedical image-text corpora) with semi-supervised web-scale multimodal data including curated e-commerce product image-text pairs.\n2) Models: Base PLMs (T5, GPT variants), pretrained vision-language encoders (CLIP variants), scene graph generation modules.\n3) Baselines: State-of-the-art RAG frameworks with modular retriever-generator coupling, adapter-based multimodal infusion models, and latest cross-modal retrieval architectures used in e-commerce.\n4) Metrics: Knowledge relevance (precision, recall), downstream task accuracy (QA, summarization, product retrieval), explainability scores (graph alignment, attention interpretability), and ablation on fusion dynamics and semi-supervised components.\n5) Experiments: Train end-to-end with staged loss scheduling; ablate fusion layer designs (e.g., gated attention vs non-adaptive fusion); evaluate semi-supervised gains via varying unlabeled data volume.\n6) Visualizations: Provide intermediate representation visualizations including cross-attention heatmaps over graph nodes and tokens, and embedding space alignment statistics.\n7) Scalability: Test robustness and retrieval latency on large e-commerce datasets to demonstrate practical deployment feasibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A chest X-ray image and the question \"What abnormal findings and relational structures are seen in the lungs?\"  \nExpected Output: A generated radiology report detailing abnormalities (e.g., \"diffuse ground-glass opacities in the left upper lung lobe, adjacent to consolidated regions\") with explicit scene graph annotations indicating spatial and relational links, facilitating clinical explanation.\n\nInput: A product image and textual query \"Find blue running shoes with breathable mesh.\" from an e-commerce platform.\nExpected Output: Ranked retrieval and generated recommendation text integrating multimodal relational cues (color, function, material), highlighting fused information from product images, descriptions, and knowledge graphs.\n\nIntermediate representations will demonstrate how adaptive fusion weights shift between modalities in response to task demands, validated by attention maps and embedding distances.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full end-to-end semi-supervised training with dynamic fusion layers proves unstable, revert to a staged training pipeline: first pretrain scene graph modules on labeled subsets, then freeze graph embeddings during RAG model training with simplified gated attention fusion. Introduce curriculum learning to gradually incorporate unlabeled data. Alternatively, replace graph-based fusion with multi-head gated attention over global image-text embeddings to reduce complexity. Perform detailed error analysis to localize issues between retrieval fidelity and generative fluency, then refine loss balancing or modularize components accordingly."

However, the explanation lacks detail on how the fusion layers dynamically balance and select among graph nodes and PLM tokens in practice, and how the end-to-end training handles potential conflicts between retrieval fidelity and generative fluency objectives. Strengthening clarity on these architectural and training dynamics—possibly with schematic illustrations or intermediate representation examples—would greatly improve soundness and reproducibility of the approach, helping reviewers and practitioners to fully grasp the mechanism's feasibility and novelty compared to prior tightly-coupled RAG variants and VL models with scene graph inputs. Clarify how relational awareness is quantitatively enforced and how multimodal graphs are aligned embedding-wise during decoding steps as well, to solidify the technical foundation of the mechanism proposed in the methodology section."

Furthermore, extending the application scenarios toward high-value domains like e-commerce product retrieval or recommendation systems could broaden the impact and novelty. Integrating advanced cross-modal retrieval strategies from e-commerce or leveraging semi-supervised paradigms might make the adaptive fusion layers more robust and scalable, reinforcing both novelty and practical relevance, thereby addressing the crowdedness of the current RAG+scene graph niche with a distinctive real-world edge and technical strength."
