    "title": "Participatory Surveillance Data Augmentation for Bias-Resistant LLM Health Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Insufficient incorporation of community participation data in health surveillance leads to biased LLM health models that underrepresent vulnerable populations' perspectives, reducing adoption and fairness in conflict-affected regions.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal and external gaps related to technology adoption and community participation integration, expanding Opportunity 1 by innovating on data augmentation with participatory surveillance inputs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a data augmentation pipeline that integrates crowd-sourced participatory health surveillance reports (e.g., community mobile health inputs) into LLM training corpora. Employ privacy-preserving algorithms to safely include sensitive data. Additionally, design bias-correction layers that recalibrate LLM outputs based on demographic participation rates to mitigate over- or under-representation in generated responses.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect participatory surveillance data from digital platforms in conflict zones. 2) Anonymize and preprocess data to integrate with existing public health corpora. 3) Fine-tune LLMs on augmented datasets with bias-correction objectives. 4) Benchmark against LLMs trained on non-augmented datasets using fairness and representation metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What are the main barriers faced by ethnic minorities in disease reporting in conflict areas?\" Output: \"Barriers include mistrust in authorities and lack of accessible digital tools, as reported by community-driven surveillance data, highlighting need for inclusive outreach.\"",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct data augmentation causes model degradation, employ synthetic minority oversampling techniques or implement transfer learning from community participation classifiers to guide LLM fine-tuning."

        "title": "Globally-Informed Participatory Surveillance Data Augmentation for Bias-Resistant LLM Health Models in Conflict Zones",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language models (LLMs) for health surveillance inadequately represent vulnerable populations in conflict-affected regions due to insufficient integration of community-participated data, resulting in biased outputs that undermine fairness, trust, and adoption among marginalized groups.",
        "Motivation": "While previous approaches focus on augmenting LLM training data with participatory surveillance inputs, the novelty and impact remain limited due to a lack of robust, ethically-grounded data collection and cross-sectoral collaboration. This proposal advances the state-of-the-art by integrating rigorous, ethically compliant participatory data acquisition frameworks co-developed with globally recognized health institutions—such as the International Union of Nutritional Sciences and the University Clinics of Kinshasa—and implementing domain-informed bias-correction architectures. This approach ensures greater representativeness, contextual relevance, and adoption potential in conflict zones, fundamentally distinguishing it from existing efforts and addressing both technological and ethical challenges holistically.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-phase method: (1) collaboratively design participatory surveillance data collection protocols aligned with ethical standards and safeguarding participant rights, in partnership with the International Union of Nutritional Sciences and University Clinics of Kinshasa, leveraging their domain and contextual expertise; (2) deploy privacy-preserving data collection tools adapted for conflict environments to gather community health reports safely and reliably; (3) develop a rigorous data validation and noise-filtering pipeline tailored for crowd-sourced data variability; (4) augment LLM training corpora with this validated data and incorporate clinically-informed bias-correction layers co-designed with partner institutions to recalibrate outputs ensuring demographic fairness and nutritional relevance; (5) implement continuous privacy and compliance audits of the entire pipeline; (6) integrate evaluation protocols that operationalize metrics for bias-correction effectiveness, data quality, and participant safety; and (7) publish an open-source framework with documentation for reproducibility and adoption by other researchers and practitioners.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Establish formal collaborations and ethical review approvals with partner global institutions, including training local enumerators on participant safety and data privacy in conflict zones.\n2) Co-develop participatory data collection guidelines with domain experts and community representatives, incorporating cultural sensitivity.\n3) Deploy pilot data collection via secure mobile health platforms, embedding privacy-preserving mechanisms such as differential privacy and secure multi-party computation.\n4) Conduct systematic data quality assessments to detect bias, noise, and missingness, using statistical and machine learning-based validation models.\n5) Develop and validate bias-correction algorithms using partnership insights, applying metrics like Demographic Parity Difference, Equalized Odds, and Representational Fairness Index.\n6) Fine-tune LLMs with the augmented and bias-corrected datasets, monitoring performance on domain-specific benchmarks.\n7) Evaluate outputs on both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback from local health practitioners and community members.\n8) Design contingency plans including synthetic minority oversampling and transfer learning from community participation classifiers to handle potential data scarcity or noise.\n9) Document all protocols, results, and refinements to ensure reproducibility and scalability in other conflict-affected settings.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What are the primary nutritional barriers faced by pregnant women from marginalized ethnic groups in conflict-affected regions of Kinshasa?\"\nOutput: \"Based on participatory surveillance co-collected with local clinics and nutritional experts, key barriers include disrupted supply chains for fortified foods, limited access to culturally appropriate antenatal care, and mistrust towards external health authorities, underscoring the need for community-tailored outreach and resource distribution.\"",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should direct data augmentation with participatory surveillance prove insufficient due to data scarcity or quality limitations, fallback strategies include leveraging synthetic minority oversampling to enrich underrepresented groups, and transfer learning approaches from classification models trained on community participation signals. Additionally, we will deepen collaborations with global partners to expand access to validated datasets and co-develop enhanced annotation schemas, thereby iteratively improving data quality and model fairness without compromising privacy or ethical compliance."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks sufficient detail regarding the handling of data collection challenges in conflict zones, particularly ethical approvals, data reliability, and participant safety. Moreover, the plan does not clearly specify metrics for bias-correction effectiveness or how privacy-preserving algorithms will be validated within this pipeline. A more rigorous and operationalized experimental design is needed to ensure practical feasibility and reproducibility, including explicit evaluation protocols and contingency strategies for data scarcity or noise inherent in crowd-sourced participatory health surveillance data in sensitive regions. Strengthening this plan will significantly mitigate implementation risks and enhance credibility for adoption and deployment in real-world, high-stakes health contexts in conflict areas, directly addressing feasibility concerns linked to the complexity of the proposed method and setting. This should be a priority before proceeding to costly model training and benchmarking phases, ensuring the latter produce meaningful and reliable outcomes rather than uncertain exploratory results that may delay impactful contributions in biased health AI models for vulnerable populations in conflict zones, where trust and fairness are paramount but data is difficult to obtain and validate safely and ethically within such experimental designs and pipelines proposed here, ensuring thorough safeguarding of participant rights and data security compliance is also critical for acceptance and scalability of this research initiative in sensitive geopolitical contexts of the target domain and user groups, further integrating domain-specific constraints and best practices for participatory surveillance data collection methods in conflict-affected populations to underpin the entire methodological framework robustly and reliably in the experiment phase and beyond for the health LLM fine-tuning pipeline and envisioned bias-correction strategies to be tested rigorously with generalizable, reproducible, and ethically sound empirical data collection and validation strategies designed specifically for these environments and communities and their unique data characteristics and vulnerabilities."

          "feedback_content": "Given that prior work strongly connects components of this idea and novelty is rated only NOV-COMPETITIVE, you must concretely increase impact and distinctiveness by actively partnering with globally-recognized institutions involved in nutritional or health research like the International Union of Nutritional Sciences or the University Clinics of Kinshasa. For instance, collaborating with these organizations could enable access to validated, rich participatory surveillance datasets or co-developing annotation guidelines and participatory data collection frameworks that more accurately reflect marginalized voices in conflict zones. These collaborations could also facilitate incorporating clinical and nutritional expertise into the bias-correction layers, enhancing model relevance and adoption. Explicitly integrating such global partnerships and domain expertise would not only enrich the training corpus but also strengthen ethical governance, increase generalizability, and markedly boost the project's novelty, real-world impact, and credibility among both local stakeholders and the international research community. This approach also strategically leverages unique contextual expertise and resources that cannot be readily replicated, helping distinguish this work from existing LLM bias-mitigation efforts through a globally-informed, culturally sensitive participatory surveillance augmentation paradigm focused on vulnerable populations in conflict-affected settings."
