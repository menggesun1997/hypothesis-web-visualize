    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs struggle to dynamically incorporate episodic context resembling human memory consolidation, limiting their effective use of knowledge bases during few-shot learning. This gap reduces model adaptability and knowledge transfer in complex tasks.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of missing integration between computational cognitive models of episodic memory and neurocognitive frameworks, fulfilling Opportunity 1 by fusing human-like context encoding mechanisms in LLM prompt engineering to enhance long-term memory leverage.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid cognitive-LSTM module that simulates episodic memory encoding and consolidation processes associated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity.

        "title": "Neuro-Cognitive Episodic Context Modeling for AGI-Driven LLM Prompt Optimization and Decision Making",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) currently lack mechanisms to dynamically encode and consolidate episodic context in a biologically plausible manner that meaningfully impacts their reasoning and decision-making during few-shot learning. This deficiency hampers their adaptability, long-term knowledge integration, and decision quality, especially on complex knowledge-intensive tasks requiring contextual reasoning and memory recall.",
        "Motivation": "While neuro-inspired prompt engineering has advanced, current approaches insufficiently simulate detailed neurocognitive processes such as episodic memory consolidation and their intrinsic influence on reasoning and decision making. By developing a neuro-cognitively grounded episodic context module that both consolidates memory and dynamically modulates LLM decision pathways, this work advances beyond static prompt enrichment towards architectures with improved context-dependent reasoning capabilities. This fusion of human-like memory consolidation and cognitive models of decision making addresses fundamental gaps in LLM adaptability and positions the research at the forefront of artificial general intelligence advancements.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a rigorously specified hybrid computational model combining a detailed LSTM-based episodic memory encoder with neuro-inspired synthetic replay and consolidation phases that emulate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity and its modulatory control over working memory. \n\n1. **Cognitive-LSTM Architecture:** Internally, the LSTM uses multi-gated cells designed to capture episodic memory traces represented as compressed, high-dimensional embeddings encoding temporal sequence, context features, and task salience. We provide detailed pseudocode specifying gating mechanisms aligning with dlPFC neural dynamics, including differentiated input, forget, and output gates that modulate encoding strength and retention.\n\n2. **Synthetic Sleep-like Replay:** Periodic replay phases simulate hippocampal-cortical interactions where sampled episodic embeddings replay internally, updating consolidated memory through gradient-based integration, forming stable, compressed context representations. Replay scheduling and strength are parameterized and controlled by an adaptive gating mechanism inspired by sleep-stage oscillation timing in humans.\n\n3. **Dynamic Prompt Embedding Modulation:** Consolidated episodic context embeddings are integrated into LLM prompt engineering dynamically, influencing token-level attention biases and context retention. Crucially, the model incorporates a decision-making subscheme whereby episodic context embeddings modulate LLM inference pathways, adjusting token generation probabilities and reasoning chain weighting according to context relevance.\n\nConcretely, this framework is implemented as an integrated module: the cognitive-LSTM episodic encoder outputs context vectors that (a) update prompt embeddings, and (b) feed a gating layer controlling the LLM decoder’s attention redistribution during few-shot inference, thereby enabling context-dependent decision modulation.\n\nWe provide a detailed computational model sketch and pseudocode for these components to ensure reproducibility and biological plausibility validation. This methodology fundamentally advances neuro-inspired prompt engineering by embedding dynamic cognitive control over LLM reasoning aligned with AGI-oriented cognitive models of decision making.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect and preprocess datasets containing naturalistic episodic memory tasks and decision-making annotations, such as EMERGE and cognitive control task collections.\n\n2) Implement the multi-gated cognitive-LSTM episodic encoder with biologically-aligned gating functions and synthetic replay scheduling mechanisms as per the computational model sketch.\n\n3) Integrate consolidated episodic embeddings both as enriched prompt vectors and as modulatory inputs controlling LLM decoder attention distributions during few-shot inference on GPT-4/PaLM.\n\n4) Evaluate on classical few-shot knowledge tasks and on AGI-relevant benchmarks assessing contextual adaptability and dynamic decision quality, e.g., context-dependent reasoning challenges, multi-step planning tasks, and episodic question answering.\n\n5) Compare against standard few-shot prompt baselines and leading neuro-inspired prompt engineering methods using metrics including accuracy, context retention, decision consistency, and reasoning trace analysis.\n\n6) Conduct detailed ablation studies disabling replay, gating control, and decision modulation components to isolate each contribution.\n\n7) Analyze biological plausibility by comparing model gating dynamics and replay patterns to dlPFC neural recordings and sleep consolidation literature.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Given this medical case description and the patient's episodic memory of previous cases, generate a diagnosis and outline reasoning steps that reflect the integrated episodic context and dynamically influenced decision pathways.\"\n\nExpected output: A diagnosis that explicitly references prior related cases encoded and consolidated by the cognitive-LSTM episodic module, with reasoning steps dynamically modulated by episodic context embeddings showing improved context retention beyond simple prompt matching. The output should demonstrate enhanced decision adaptability under changing episodic inputs compared to baseline LLM outputs.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the cognitive-LSTM replay-based module fails to yield meaningful improvements, pivot to a transformer-based episodic encoder incorporating attention mechanisms to explicitly model and weigh episodic context elements. Additionally, explore neuro-symbolic memory graph structures to explicitly store and query episodic memories, integrating these graph-based memories as context controllers for dynamic prompt and decision pathway modulation. Throughout, maintain the focus on embedding cognitive decision influence aligned with AGI themes to preserve novelty and impact."

Clearer elaboration is needed on the internal LSTM architecture, the nature of episodic encoding representations, and how replay and consolidation phases interact with prompt embeddings. Without precise mechanistic descriptions, reproducibility and assessment of biological plausibility are difficult, weakening both soundness and feasibility claims. Consider providing a detailed computational model sketch or pseudo-code to clarify these mechanisms upfront, which will aid validation and implementation phases outlined downstream in the plan. This clarity is critical to convince reviewers of the conceptual and technical grounding of the neuro-cognitive simulation approach proposed for prompt optimization methods in LLMs. Target this feedback primarily to the Proposed_Method section for refinement and elaboration to enhance methodological rigor and reproducibility potential."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and the strong existing work overlaps in neuro-inspired LLM prompt engineering, a promising avenue to broaden impact and increase competitive edge is to explicitly connect the episodic context modeling framework to broader AGI themes. Integrate insights from cognitive models of decision making by enabling the episodic module not only to consolidate but also to influence LLM reasoning decisions dynamically during few-shot inference. This could position the work toward artificial general intelligence by modeling context-dependent decision pathways rather than static prompt improvements. Suggest augmenting the methodology with experiments that measure improvements in decision-making quality or adaptability on benchmark AGI-related tasks. Such an integration will leverage the 'cognitive models of decision making' global concept, potentially elevating the work from prompt engineering to advancing more generalizable intelligence architectures, enhancing both novelty and long-term impact. Emphasize this suggestion to expand the Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan sections accordingly."
