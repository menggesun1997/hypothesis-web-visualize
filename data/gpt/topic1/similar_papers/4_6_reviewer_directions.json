    "title": "Cognitive-Inspired Episodic Memory Integration for Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs lack mechanisms to simulate episodic memory formation drawing from multi-modal knowledge graphs, limiting long-term personalized and contextualized reasoning.",
    "Motivation": "Utilizes the hidden bridge from cognitive memory models to knowledge graph architectures, addressing internal gaps on multi-hop reasoning and memory architecture integration, pioneering a novel episodic memory module for LLMs using multi-modal knowledge.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design and implement an episodic memory management system inspired by human cognition, where multi-modal knowledge graph segments are dynamically encoded and stored as episodes with contextual timestamps, enabling LLMs to retrieve contextually grounded reasoning episodes during inference and improve continuity and personalization.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate multi-modal episodic knowledge graph datasets or simulate episodic contexts. 2) Build episodic memory encoding and retrieval modules interfacing with LLMs. 3) Evaluate on tasks requiring contextual consistency, personalization, and multi-hop inference over episodic data. 4) Compare with standard memory models for retention and reasoning coherence.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Personalized query \"Recall my previous interest in AI ethics when discussing new developments in autonomous vehicles.\" Output: LLM retrieves episodic knowledge graph nodes related to user's past interests and integrates them with current multi-modal facts for a coherent, personalized response.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If episodic segmentation is ineffective, fallback to semantic clustering to define memory episodes or use attention over a sliding window of facts as proxy episodic memory."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks detailed clarity on how the episodic memory management system will function technically, specifically in terms of dynamically encoding, storing, and retrieving multi-modal knowledge graph segments as episodes. The proposal should explicitly describe the representation format, algorithms, and interfacing mechanisms with LLMs to ensure sound integration and operational feasibility beyond inspiration from cognitive models alone. This detail is essential for assessing the validity and replicability of the core mechanism (Proposed_Method). For example, how are contextual timestamps generated and leveraged? What are the criteria for episode segmentation? Also, how does the system handle the heterogeneity of multi-modal data during retrieval? Addressing these aspects would strengthen the soundness of the approach and support its novelty claims within a competitive space, enabling reviewers and future researchers to understand and build upon the method effectively.

Curating multi-modal episodic knowledge graph datasets or simulating episodic contexts is a significant challenge that requires clearer specification of data sources, modalities, and annotation methods. Additionally, the plan should specify concrete evaluation metrics for contextual consistency, personalization, and multi-hop reasoning to ensure measurable and reproducible results. Details on baseline selection and statistical testing methods for comparison with standard memory models should also be included. Strengthening this section with practical steps and contingency planning for dataset limitations or integration issues will elevate confidence in the feasibility of experimental validation and the credibility of the proposed episodic memory module.
