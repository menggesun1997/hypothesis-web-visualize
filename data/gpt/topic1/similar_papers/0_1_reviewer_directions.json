    "title": "Reinforcement Learning Driven Retriever-Generator Co-Optimization for Dynamic Knowledge Distillation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Retriever and generator components in RAG systems are often trained separately, leading to suboptimal synergy and rigid knowledge selection, which restricts the generative capacity and adaptability of LLMs.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing internal gap (a) and external gap regarding reinforcement learning (RL) underexploitation, this idea leverages RL-driven knowledge distillation and retrieval adaptation to jointly optimize retriever and generator for dynamic, context-aware knowledge fusion and improved downstream performance.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We develop an RL framework where the retriever is treated as a policy network selecting knowledge snippets, while the generator acts as the environment producing responses. The reward signal combines metrics of generative relevance, factual consistency, and downstream task success. Knowledge adapters and fusion layers are trained in tandem via policy gradients to encourage adaptive retrieval strategies and flexible knowledge integration conditioned on context and decoding state.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset: Use open-domain QA benchmarks (Natural Questions, WebGPT), and biomedical retrieval datasets. 2) Models: Transformer-based retriever and generator architectures initialized from pretrained weights. 3) Baselines: Separate training pipelines, static retrieval techniques. 4) Metrics: Retrieval precision/recall, generation quality (BLEU, ROUGE), factual correctness (QA accuracy, FEVER). 5) Implement reward shaping and curriculum learning to stabilize training. 6) Conduct ablations on reward components and adapter sizes.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Question \"What are the side effects of ibuprofen?\" Expected Output: Concise answer dynamically retrieved from updated medical knowledge bases incorporating specific side effects, with retrieval patterns evolving across training to optimize for accuracy and fluency.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If RL training is unstable, consider hybrid supervised plus RL fine-tuning regimes or use off-policy RL with experience replay. Also, explore imitation learning from oracle retriever-generator pairs to bootstrap policies before applying RL."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method treats the retriever as a policy network and the generator as the environment within an RL framework, training them jointly via policy gradients. However, the proposal lacks clarity on how the interdependence between retriever actions and generator outputs is modeled without introducing high variance in the reward signal. Provide more precise technical details on this joint optimization's formulation, how credit assignment is handled between retriever and generator, and mechanisms to mitigate instability inherent in RL training. This clarity is critical to establish the soundness of the approach's core mechanism and reduce ambiguity that could hinder reproducibility or successful implementation at scale. Consider formalizing how context-awareness and decoding state conditioning influence policy updates distinctly from the generator's role as part of the environment rather than an independent model component. Including a schematic or algorithmic pseudocode would be very beneficial here for explicating the interaction dynamics and learning signals involved between retriever and generator components under the RL regime, strengthening soundness and conceptual rigor of the approach from the outset of development and evaluation phases.  \n\nMoreover, addressing potential confounding factors such as how reward shaping is calibrated to balance generative relevance, factual consistency, and downstream task success will improve the explanatory power and technical feasibility of the method proposed, avoiding oversimplified assumptions about RL stability in complex generation pipelines like RAG systems."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan is broadly well-structured, including multiple datasets, baseline comparisons, and relevant metrics. However, the plan currently does not sufficiently detail how to ensure stable RL training and manage the high computational cost and sample inefficiency typical of RL in NLP tasks. More concrete descriptions are needed on how curriculum learning and reward shaping will be systematically designed, validated, and tuned. \n\nFurthermore, the fallback plan mentions hybrid supervised plus RL fine-tuning or off-policy RL and imitation learning, but these are only lightly sketched. It would enhance feasibility to explicitly integrate these fallback or stabilization strategies into experimental milestones, specifying criteria or triggers for switching training modes or applying hybrid approaches. Include evaluation checkpoints aimed at monitoring and diagnosing instability issues early, such as reward variance analysis, convergence diagnostics, and ablation studies on reward components and adapter sizes.\n\nFinally, given the proposed alternation between various datasets (open-domain and biomedical), clarify strategies for data domain adaptation or transfer learning within the RL framework, as domain mismatches could affect both retriever and generator behavior adversely if not accounted for. Providing this level of detail will concretely support replicability and reduce risk of experimental failure due to overly optimistic assumptions about RL training robustness in practice."
