Traditional healthcare methods, often characterized by limitations in disease prevention, predominantly react to illnesses after their onset rather than proactively averting them. The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has ushered in a wave of transformative applications designed to enhance healthcare services, with Machine Learning (ML) as a noteworthy subset of AI. ML empowers computers to analyze extensive datasets, while Deep Learning (DL), a specific ML methodology, excels at extracting meaningful patterns from these data troves. Despite notable technological advancements in recent years, the full potential of these applications within medical contexts remains largely untapped, primarily due to the medical community's cautious stance toward novel technologies. The motivation of this paper lies in recognizing the pivotal role of the healthcare sector in community well-being and the necessity for a shift toward proactive healthcare approaches. To our knowledge, there is a notable absence of a comprehensive published review that delves into ML, DL and distributed systems, all aimed at elevating the Quality of Service (QoS) in healthcare. This study seeks to bridge this gap by presenting a systematic and organized review of prevailing ML, DL, and distributed system algorithms as applied in healthcare settings. Within our work, we outline key challenges that both current and future developers may encounter, with a particular focus on aspects such as approach, data utilization, strategy, and development processes. Our study findings reveal that the Internet of Things (IoT) stands out as the most frequently utilized platform (44.3\\xa0%), with disease diagnosis emerging as the predominant healthcare application (47.8\\xa0%). Notably, discussions center significantly on the prevention and identification of cardiovascular diseases (29.2\\xa0%). The studies under examination employ a diverse range of ML and DL methods, along with distributed systems, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) being the most commonly used (16.7\\xa0%), followed by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks (14.6\\xa0%) and shallow learning networks (12.5\\xa0%). In evaluating QoS, the predominant emphasis revolves around the accuracy parameter (80\\xa0%). This study highlights how ML, DL, and distributed systems reshape healthcare. It contributes to advancing healthcare quality, bridging the gap between technology and medical adoption, and benefiting practitioners and patients.\"}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton (Analysis of the 10 papers)\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the 10 papers.

    "title": "Landscape Map for Incorporating Knowledge Bases into LLMs for Fairness and Bias Mitigation",
    "current_research_landscape": "The current research cluster, drawn from foundational literature and local network analysis, centrally addresses complex socio-economic and health challenges within fragile, conflict-affected, and economically developing settings. The core focus (as shown by central nodes) lies in promoting local economic development through fiscal decentralization and addressing epidemic outbreaks in conflict zones via infectious disease response. The dominant research paradigms include narrative and systematic reviews evaluating digital tools and technologies such as mobile health (mHealth), machine learning (ML), and distributed systems to improve healthcare quality and governance, as well as to enhance surveillance and economic development outcomes. Methodologies involve leveraging AI/ML (notably CNNs and LSTMs), digital infrastructure, and decentralized governance frameworks to stimulate local development and disease management under complex socio-political conditions. These thematic islands reflect a multi-disciplinary approach combining health science, public policy, and digital technology innovation, with bridge nodes indicating intersections where fiscal decentralization could impact economic and health intervention efficacy.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps Identified include the limited translational adoption of AI and ML technologies by medical and local governance communities, due to cautious attitudes towards novel tech and insufficient integration of distributed systems with domain-specific knowledge bases. The bridge concepts (\"local economic development\" and \"fiscal decentralization\") suggest a lack of comprehensive frameworks that combine economic governance with experiential public health surveillance and AI-driven interventions in conflict or post-conflict settings. Notably, fairness and bias mitigation in AI applications within socioeconomically and politically diverse environments remain underexplored. \n\nExternal/Novel Gaps arise from the 'hidden bridge' revealing insufficient cross-disciplinary integration between economic development policy, conflict settings, and health technology assessment. Specifically, leveraging health policy-making processes and community participation frameworks (highlighted in global context) to align AI-driven fiscal decentralization and infectious disease response is missing. Incorporating Sustainable Development Goals and human development benchmarks into AI fairness frameworks for LLMs applied in these areas could address bias from ethnic diversity and migration effects—unique challenges not yet integrated into current AI models or knowledge bases.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Develop an AI-driven multi-modal knowledge base integrating fiscal decentralization data and infectious disease surveillance augmented with community participation metrics to enhance fairness and bias mitigation in LLMs. This aligns the hidden bridge concepts of community participation and economic/health policy processes with the observed internal gap of technology adoption barriers.\n\nOpportunity 2: Leverage health technology assessment guidelines and Sustainable Development Goal frameworks to construct contextual fairness constraints in LLM prompting and reasoning, thus mitigating bias across socioeconomically and ethnically diverse conflict-affected populations. This bridges global policy goals with local challenges in disease response and economic development.\n\nOpportunity 3: Integrate distributed AI and machine learning models, currently prevalent in healthcare applications (CNN, LSTM), with fiscal decentralization governance data to create dynamic, explainable knowledge bases. These would support equitable decision-making by LLMs in resource allocation and health policy, addressing both the internal technical gaps and the hidden cross-disciplinary connections identified."
