    "title": "SDG-Constrained Prompt Engineering for Bias Mitigation in LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs applied in socioeconomically diverse, conflict-affected populations reflect biased reasoning that ignores Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and human development benchmarks in decision processes, amplifying ethnic and migration-related disparities.",
    "Motivation": "Tackles the external gap of integrating SDGs and human development indicators into LLM fairness frameworks, addressing Opportunity 2 by embedding global policy constraints into AI reasoning, thus linking global goals with local conflict and health challenges.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a prompt engineering framework that injects SDG-based contextual fairness constraints directly into LLM decoding. This involves creating a modular prompt template embedding policy guidelines, fairness criteria derived from SDGs (e.g., reduced inequalities, good health), and demographic sensitivity modules. Develop a plug-and-play adapter layer to dynamically enforce these constraints during generation, ensuring outputs align with equity and fairness objectives in conflict-affected narratives and policy recommendations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Extract textual SDG guidelines and policy frameworks relevant to health and economic development. 2) Create prompt templates incorporating fairness constraints. 3) Implement adapter layers in LLM architectures to condition outputs on these constraints. 4) Evaluate on datasets with socioeconomically and ethnically diverse scenarios (e.g., policy documents, health advisories). Baselines: vanilla LLMs without constraints. Metrics: bias metrics (e.g., subgroup accuracy), adherence to SDG goals, human evaluation of fairness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Advise on allocating health resources in a multi-ethnic post-conflict region.\" Output: \"Allocate resources prioritizing marginalized ethnic groups to reduce health disparities, ensure sustainable economic development per SDG targets.\"",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If prompt-constrained decoding fails, fallback to post-processing output filtering based on fairness classifiers, or use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to teach adherence to SDG-aligned fairness policies."

        "title": "Dynamic SDG-Constrained Adapter Framework for Fair and Coherent LLM Reasoning in Multi-Ethnic Conflict Contexts",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) deployed in socioeconomically diverse, conflict-affected populations often exhibit biased reasoning that neglects Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and human development benchmarks. This leads to amplified ethnic and migration-related disparities in policy guidance and narrative generation. Existing approaches to fairness in LLMs rarely integrate structured global policy constraints dynamically during generation, resulting in outputs that may trade off coherence or factual accuracy when fairness is enforced post hoc or superficially.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the critical gap of embedding multi-dimensional SDG fairness criteria within LLMsâ€™ generative processes in a manner that balances ethical constraints with language quality is essential for equitable AI systems. This work innovates beyond existing prompt-tuning or static post-processing bias mitigation by proposing a novel dynamic adapter framework that tightly couples SDG-aligned policies with real-time generation control. Integrating intelligent decision-making principles and modular agent-like components within the adapter enhances controllability without sacrificing fluency or factuality, thus substantially advancing fairness-aware NLP for conflict-affected multi-ethnic settings.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a Dynamic SDG-Constrained Adapter Framework embedded within transformer decoder layers to enforce fairness constraints aligned with SDGs during LLM generation. The adapter consists of: (1) a Policy Encoder Module that transforms textual SDG guidelines and demographic fairness criteria into dense constraint representations; (2) a Conflict Resolution Engine that dynamically mediates competing constraints using reinforcement learning from human feedback and constraint prioritization heuristics; (3) a Contextual Sensitivity Layer that conditions output logits in real-time on local demographic and conflict-sensitive parameters, leveraging intelligent decision-making algorithms adapted from agent systems. Architecturally, the adapter interfaces with decoder hidden states via multi-head attention, modulating generation probability distributions seamlessly. To preserve language fluency and factual accuracy, the system employs a hybrid gate mechanism blending adapter outputs with base LLM predictions weighted by uncertainty estimates from a natural language understanding submodule. This design enables fine-grained controllability and maintains coherence, as supported by preliminary architectural sketches illustrating integrated multi-module data flow. By embedding these mechanisms within LLMs rather than relying solely on prompt design or post-processing, our approach offers superior, real-time adherence to complex SDG fairness constraints.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Preparation: Curate a novel multi-ethnic, conflict-affected policy advisory dataset combining (a) public domain health and economic policy documents with demographic meta-data, (b) synthetic scenario augmentations reflecting SDG and local fairness dynamics, and (c) urban digital twin simulation outputs modeling socioeconomic factors. 2) Constraint Formalization: Extract and encode SDG textual guidelines and local fairness criteria into machine-readable policies via natural language processing pipelines. 3) Implementation: Develop the dynamic adapter modules within state-of-the-art decoder architectures (e.g., GPT-4 or open LLMs), integrating conflict resolution and contextual sensitivity components. 4) Baselines: Compare against vanilla LLMs, prompt-constrained models without adapters, and RLHF-finetuned versions emphasizing fairness. 5) Evaluation: Employ quantitative bias metrics (e.g., subgroup accuracy gaps, fairness disparity indices) and SDG adherence scores grounded in policy benchmarks. 6) Human Evaluation: Engage domain experts and conflict-sensitive social scientists to conduct blind assessments using a standardized protocol measuring fairness, coherence, and factual accuracy. Ethical guidelines and annotator training protocols will be established to ensure reliability. 7) Success Criteria: Demonstrate statistically significant reductions in bias metrics and improved SDG compliance over baselines without compromising language fluency (measured by perplexity and human rating).",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Advise on allocating health resources in a multi-ethnic post-conflict region with constrained budgets.\" Output: \"Prioritize resource allocation to marginalized ethnic groups identified via local demographic data, ensuring reductions in health disparities aligned with SDG3 and SDG10. Recommendations incorporate sustainable economic recovery considerations sensitive to ongoing conflict dynamics, maintaining transparent rationale per policy guidelines.\"",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time adapter conditioning proves too complex or degrades fluency, fallback strategies include: (1) Post-generation filtering using ensemble fairness classifiers trained on SDG-aware criteria to edit generated outputs, (2) RLHF-based fine-tuning to internally adjust model weights for SDG compliance, and (3) incorporating a simulated urban digital twin environment to generate synthetic training data that better grounds demographic sensitivities. These alternatives maintain a focus on balancing fairness with language quality while providing pragmatic contingencies."

However, it lacks clarity on how these adapters will effectively transform or constrain the large LLM outputs without degrading language quality or fluency. The mechanism for dynamically integrating complex policy guidelines with real-time demographic sensitivity during generation is underspecified, including how conflicts between competing constraints are managed or resolved. You should provide a more detailed algorithmic or architectural design, perhaps with preliminary technical sketches illustrating the adapter's integration with decoder states and how controllability is achieved without substantial tradeoffs to model coherence or factual accuracy, to strengthen the soundness of the approach's core mechanism component in the Proposed_Method section."

Given the complexity and sensitivity of the tasks, the feasibility of (1) obtaining high-quality, domain-specific datasets covering conflict-affected multi-ethnic regions and (2) evaluating fairness metrics aligned with SDGs needs further elaboration. More concretely, you should specify which datasets will be used or created, how human evaluation will be operationalized (e.g., expert annotators, evaluation protocols), and what success thresholds or baselines beyond vanilla LLMs are realistic. Strengthening these experimental details will increase confidence in the practical feasibility of the approach."
