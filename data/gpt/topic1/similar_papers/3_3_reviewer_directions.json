    "title": "Cross-Domain AI Framework for Fiscal Health Policy Alignment Using LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current AI applications insufficiently integrate economic governance and infectious disease response data within LLMs, missing cross-disciplinary synergies critical for bias mitigation in fragile socio-political contexts.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external novel gap of cross-disciplinary integration across economic policy, conflict settings, and health tech, developing a framework that unifies these domains for fairness-aware LLM outputs, inspired by hidden bridge insights.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a hybrid reasoning system combining probabilistic graphical models encoding economic governance dependencies and infectious disease models with LLM-based natural language reasoning. The framework will enable coherent alignment of fiscal decentralization policies with health intervention strategies. It includes bias-detection modules analyzing socio-political contextual signals to adjust LLM responses dynamically.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop probabilistic models of fiscal policy impacts on health outcomes using real-world data. 2) Integrate these models with LLMs via a controller module that conditions language generation on probabilistic outputs. 3) Train bias detectors on historical policy documents reflecting socio-political disparities. 4) Evaluate on cross-domain scenarios requiring economic-health policy synthesis. Metrics: policy coherence, fairness, and factuality.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Suggest fiscal measures to improve epidemic control in economically decentralized conflict zones.\" Output: \"Increase local health spending through fiscal decentralization mechanisms shown probabilistically to improve epidemic outcomes, ensuring marginalized groups receive equitable funding.\"",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If probabilistic integration hinders real-time generation, revert to a pipelined approach where LLMs post-process outputs from separate economic and health models. Alternatively, simplify bias detectors using heuristic rules."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that economic governance and infectious disease response data can be effectively integrated within LLMs via probabilistic graphical models and bias-detection modules requires stronger theoretical justification and empirical support. Specifically, the feasibility of capturing complex dependencies across socio-political and health domains in a unified probabilistic model, and successfully conditioning LLM outputs in real-time, needs clarification. Grounding these assumptions in prior multi-domain model integrations or preliminary exploratory analysis would enhance soundness and credibility of the approach, reducing risk of oversimplification or model mismatch issues inherent in cross-domain fusion tasks in fragile contexts. Provide explicit argumentation or references evidencing such integration viability and precedent within related work or pilot experiments to substantiate the frameworkâ€™s foundational premises in Proposed_Method and Problem_Statement sections, before extensive development efforts proceed."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "While the stepwise experimental plan is well-structured, it underestimates the high complexity and data quality challenges in modeling fiscal policy impacts on health outcomes in socio-politically fragile and decentralized conflict zones. Obtaining, cleaning, and validating real-world multi-source datasets that can reliably inform probabilistic models presents a significant feasibility hurdle, as does acquiring labeled data for effective bias detector training reflecting socio-political disparities across diverse contexts. To improve feasibility, explicitly outline data sources, validation strategies, and contingency plans beyond simplifying bias detectors heuristically, e.g., leveraging synthetic data, simulation environments, or incremental prototyping phases. Detailing the expected computational costs and approximate time frames for training/inference in integrated probabilistic-LLM systems will also clarify practical implications. Revising and enriching the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan to address these critical data and complexity challenges with specific mitigation measures will strengthen implementation prospects and resource planning."
