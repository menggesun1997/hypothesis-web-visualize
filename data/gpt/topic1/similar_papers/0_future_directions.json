        "title": "Multimodal Scene Graph Fusion for Adaptive Knowledge Retrieval",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current retrieval-augmented generation systems suffer from limited synergy between retriever and generator components and poor relational attribute modeling, especially when dealing with multi-granular contexts involving multimodal data. This impairs the effective incorporation of external knowledge into LLMs, hindering explainability and performance in complex tasks.",
        "Motivation": "This idea targets internal gaps (a) and (b) by introducing an integrated multimodal scene graph fusion mechanism within adaptive fusion layers, inspired by Opportunity 1 which suggests leveraging vision-language model advances and scene graph generation to improve relational reasoning and knowledge incorporation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a unified architecture that constructs joint multimodal scene graphs from visual inputs and textual knowledge sources. The fusion layers adaptively select and integrate these graph-based relational contexts with retrieval-augmented generation by tightly coupling retriever and generator via shared embedding spaces learned end-to-end. This entails a cross-modal attention mechanism connecting knowledge graph nodes with PLM tokens, enabling dynamic context augmentation during decoding with relational awareness.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset: Use multimodal knowledge-intensive datasets such as KnowledgeVQA, WebQA with annotated graphs, and domain-specific biomedical image-text corpora. 2) Models: Base PLM (e.g., T5 or GPT), pretrained vision-language encoders, scene graph generators. 3) Baselines: Current RAG frameworks with disjoint retriever-generator, adapter-based infusion models. 4) Metrics: Knowledge relevance (precision/recall), downstream task accuracy (QA, summarization), explainability scores (graph alignment), and ablation of fusion layers. 5) Train end-to-end with joint losses enforcing retrieval fidelity and generative fluency.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A chest X-ray image and the question, \"What abnormal findings and relational structures are seen in the lungs?\" Expected Output: A generated radiology report describing abnormalities (e.g., \"diffuse ground-glass opacities in the left upper lung lobe, adjacent to consolidated regions\"), annotated with scene graph structures reflecting spatial relationships, enhancing explanation and clinical relevance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full multimodal joint training proves unstable, fallback to modular pretraining of vision-language scene graphs followed by frozen integration during RAG training. Alternatively, simplify fusion layers to gated multimodal attention without full graph representation. Perform error analysis to isolate bottlenecks in retrieval vs. generation components."

        "title": "Reinforcement Learning Driven Retriever-Generator Co-Optimization for Dynamic Knowledge Distillation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Retriever and generator components in RAG systems are often trained separately, leading to suboptimal synergy and rigid knowledge selection, which restricts the generative capacity and adaptability of LLMs.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing internal gap (a) and external gap regarding reinforcement learning (RL) underexploitation, this idea leverages RL-driven knowledge distillation and retrieval adaptation to jointly optimize retriever and generator for dynamic, context-aware knowledge fusion and improved downstream performance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We develop an RL framework where the retriever is treated as a policy network selecting knowledge snippets, while the generator acts as the environment producing responses. The reward signal combines metrics of generative relevance, factual consistency, and downstream task success. Knowledge adapters and fusion layers are trained in tandem via policy gradients to encourage adaptive retrieval strategies and flexible knowledge integration conditioned on context and decoding state.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset: Use open-domain QA benchmarks (Natural Questions, WebGPT), and biomedical retrieval datasets. 2) Models: Transformer-based retriever and generator architectures initialized from pretrained weights. 3) Baselines: Separate training pipelines, static retrieval techniques. 4) Metrics: Retrieval precision/recall, generation quality (BLEU, ROUGE), factual correctness (QA accuracy, FEVER). 5) Implement reward shaping and curriculum learning to stabilize training. 6) Conduct ablations on reward components and adapter sizes.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Question \"What are the side effects of ibuprofen?\" Expected Output: Concise answer dynamically retrieved from updated medical knowledge bases incorporating specific side effects, with retrieval patterns evolving across training to optimize for accuracy and fluency.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If RL training is unstable, consider hybrid supervised plus RL fine-tuning regimes or use off-policy RL with experience replay. Also, explore imitation learning from oracle retriever-generator pairs to bootstrap policies before applying RL."

        "title": "Dynamic Multisource Knowledge Graph Fusion for Biomedical NLP via Adaptive Pretraining",
        "Problem_Statement": "Biomedical and clinical NLP applications demand integration of heterogeneous structured knowledge sources with limited annotated data; current LLM contextualization methods inadequately fuse multi-source domain knowledge dynamically, limiting effectiveness in specialized fields.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by Opportunity 3 and external gaps about heterogeneous knowledge source integration, this proposal aims to bridge internal gap (c) by developing dynamic fusion layers specialized for biomedical knowledge graphs during domain-adaptive pretraining, enhancing low-resource biomedical NLP performance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We design a dynamic multisource fusion architecture that ingests multiple biomedical knowledge graphs (UMLS, MeSH, clinical ontologies) and structured databases alongside textual corpora. Adaptive fusion layers condition knowledge selection and embedding based on context and uncertainty assessment. Domain-adaptive pretraining jointly optimizes PLM parameters and fusion layers to align graph knowledge with biomedical tasks. Also introduce retrieval cycles optimized for graph structure relevance and multi-hop reasoning.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset: Use biomedical corpora (PubMed abstracts, MIMIC-III EHR notes), knowledge graphs (UMLS, SNOMED). 2) Tasks: Biomedical QA, entity linking, relation extraction. 3) Baselines: Standard biomedical PLMs (BioBERT, PubMedBERT), existing knowledge infusion models. 4) Metrics: Precision, recall on biomedical NLP benchmarks, contextual knowledge probing, annotation efficiency. 5) Evaluate robustness under domain shift with out-of-distribution test sets.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical note mentioning \"patient with atrial fibrillation and acute stroke\". Expected Output: Accurate linking and generation incorporating relevant interconnected biomedical concepts and suggesting treatment interactions, enabled by multi-source graph fusion.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If simultaneous multisource training is too complex, progressively pretrain fusion layers independently per knowledge source before integration. Alternatively, reduce complexity by focusing on top-K graph substructures per context."

        "title": "Hierarchical Vision-Language Scene Graph Generation for Multi-Granularity Retrieval Enhancement",
        "Problem_Statement": "Limited modeling of shared attributes and relational reasoning within structural contexts such as scene graphs constrains explainability and fine-grained knowledge incorporation in RAG methods, especially in vision-language tasks involving multiple granularity levels.",
        "Motivation": "By expanding on internal gap (b) and opportunity 1, this work proposes a hierarchical scene graph generation pipeline that models attribute commonalities and relational structures across semantic layers to boost multi-granular retrieval and generative contextualization.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We develop a multi-level scene graph generator producing layered graphs capturing objects, attributes, and relations with a hierarchy of granularity (e.g., coarse to fine). This hierarchical graph is embedded and integrated in knowledge-enhanced PLMs via adaptive fusion layers, enhancing relational reasoning during retrieval and generation. Cross-layer message passing ensures attribute commonalities are leveraged across granularity scales, improving multi-hop knowledge propagation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset: Use Vision-and-Language datasets (Visual Genome, VQA 2.0), along with biomedical image-text datasets. 2) Model Components: Scene graph generators, hierarchical GNNs, fusion layer adapters with PLM backbone. 3) Baselines: Flat scene graph fusion, RAG without relational hierarchy. 4) Evaluation: Retrieval precision/recall at multiple granularity levels, generation coherence, explainability via graph visualizations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Medical image plus text query, \"Identify and relate all abnormalities with their attributes in the lung region.\" Expected Output: Detailed hierarchical graph capturing abnormalities and associated descriptors, integrated into generated clinical summary with relational richness.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If hierarchical graph construction is noisy, fallback to flat scene graphs with enhanced attribute clustering or learn graph abstractions during training instead of explicit multi-level graphs."

        "title": "Joint Representation Learning Framework Combining Knowledge Graphs and Scene Graphs for Explainable LLM Contextualization",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current approaches fail to tightly integrate heterogeneous knowledge graphs with scene graph generation methods, limiting cross-modal relational reasoning and explainability within LLM contextualization frameworks.",
        "Motivation": "Targeting external gap about integrating vision-language models and graph structured knowledge, this research synthesizes knowledge graphs and scene graphs into a joint representation space, enabling explainable, contextually rich LLM generation. It addresses internal gap (b) and opportunity 1 by unifying graph modalities for multi-granularity reasoning.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Propose a dual-graph embedding framework that encodes knowledge graphs (KG) and vision-language scene graphs (SG) into a shared latent space via contrastive and graph alignment learning. Fusion layers in PLMs query this joint space dynamically during generation with relational attention modules. This leads to improved multi-hop inferencing, transparent knowledge attribution, and enhanced task performance on multimodal benchmarks.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Datasets: Visual Genome + relevant KG datasets (e.g., ConceptNet, biomedical KGs). 2) Models: Pretrained PLMs augmented with joint KG-SG encoders. 3) Baselines: Separate KG or SG embeddings in RAG, no joint training. 4) Metrics: Task accuracy on VQA, report generation, explainability evaluations via graph node attribution.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Image-text QA task asking, \"What is the relationship between the person and the object they hold?\" Expected Output: Generated answer referencing joint KG-SG reasoning highlighting object-person interaction with improved interpretability.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If joint embedding learning underperforms, explore staged training with frozen KG or SG embeddings, or attention weighting mechanisms to balance graph contributions dynamically."
