    "title": "Community-Grounded Multimodal Knowledge Bases for LLM Fairness",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs suffer from bias due to underrepresentation of socio-economic and ethnically diverse communities, especially in conflict-affected and economically fragile settings. There is a lack of integrative frameworks combining fiscal decentralization, public health data, and community participation to mitigate bias in LLM outputs.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient integration of distributed systems with domain-specific knowledge bases and the external gap of missing community participation frameworks. This aligns with Opportunity 1 from the landscape map, leveraging hidden bridges between economic governance, health surveillance, and community participation to improve fairness.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel AI-driven multimodal knowledge base that fuses datasets on fiscal decentralization policies, infectious disease surveillance, and community engagement metrics (e.g., participatory governance surveys). Use graph neural networks (GNNs) to contextualize relationships between economic policies and health outcomes at local levels. Integrate this knowledge base with LLM prompting mechanisms to enforce fairness-aware response constraints, ensuring representation and mitigating ethnic and socio-economic bias.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets: fiscal decentralization indicators, health surveillance records, community participation surveys from conflict and post-conflict zones. 2) Construct a multimodal knowledge graph combining these datasets with socio-economic and ethnic features. 3) Train GNN encoders on this graph to learn latent representations. 4) Fine-tune LLMs with augmented context injection from the knowledge base. Baselines: standard LLMs without knowledge base. Metrics: fairness metrics (Demographic Parity, Equalized Odds), factuality, bias reduction, model calibration.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What measures should be prioritized to control a disease outbreak in a conflict-affected region with diverse ethnic groups?\" Expected Output: \"Prioritize community-led surveillance combined with decentralized fiscal support ensuring equitable resource allocation to underserved ethnic communities, mitigating historical biases seen in previous interventions.\"",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If GNN integration underperforms, fallback to simpler rule-based knowledge injection based on community participation thresholds. Alternatively, enrich datasets with synthetic minority data augmentation or incorporate human-in-the-loop fine-tuning to improve fairness outcomes."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that combining fiscal decentralization policies, infectious disease data, and community participation metrics into one multimodal knowledge base can effectively reduce LLM bias regarding socio-economic and ethnic diversity. However, the underlying assumption that these heterogeneous datasets are compatible and sufficiently representative—especially in conflict-affected and economically fragile regions—is not fully justified. There is a risk that data scarcity, quality issues, or latent confounders could limit the intended fairness gains. The authors should explicitly examine data availability, representativeness, and possible biases in each dataset before integration and consider the effect of missing or noisy data on the knowledge graph and GNN representations. Clearer justification or preliminary data audits would strengthen this core assumption's soundness and motivate the proposed method better. This is critical because if the foundational datasets are insufficient or biased, the downstream fairness improvements may be illusory or partial, undermining the whole approach's validity and impact potential. Please add discussion, data audits, or feasibility analyses demonstrating this approach's foundational viability for the targeted regions and groups in 'Problem_Statement' and 'Proposed_Method'. This is a must-fix to solidify the paper’s scientific foundation and credibility at the core methodological level."

          "feedback_content": "While the experimental plan is broadly logical, the practicality and scientific soundness of training GNN encoders on combined multimodal knowledge graphs from highly heterogeneous socio-economic, health, and governance datasets need deeper clarification. Specific concerns include: how the different modalities and feature types will be aligned in a unified graph, how missing or unreliable data will be handled in training, and whether the graph scale and complexity are manageable for GNN training given real-world data limitations. The plan also lacks details on validation splits, procedures to evaluate whether GNN embeddings truly capture fairness-relevant relationships, and ablation studies to isolate the impact of each data modality. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs with augmented context injection requires clearer technical protocols and computational feasibility estimations. The fallback plan could benefit from explicit criteria for fallback triggers and concrete alternatives. Addressing these feasibility gaps by adding concrete experimental protocols, data preprocessing details, and risk mitigation strategies would greatly improve the credibility and reproducibility of the work. Please update the 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' accordingly to make the empirical approach both scientifically robust and practically feasible."
