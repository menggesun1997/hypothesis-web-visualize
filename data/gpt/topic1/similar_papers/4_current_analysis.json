  "prompt": "You are a world-class research strategist and data synthesizer. Your mission is to analyze a curated set of research papers and their underlying conceptual structure to produce a comprehensive 'Landscape Map' that reveals the current state, critical gaps, and novel opportunities in the field of **Memory-Enhanced Architectures in LLMs Using Knowledge Bases for Efficient Long-Term Reasoning**.\n\n### Part A: Foundational Literature\nHere are the core similar research papers, which includes the paperId, title and abstract.\n```text\n[{'paper_id': 1, 'title': 'Foundation models and intelligent decision-making: Progress, challenges, and perspectives', 'abstract': \"Intelligent decision-making (IDM) is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to automate or augment decision processes. Modern IDM paradigms integrate advanced frameworks to enable intelligent agents to make effective and adaptive choices and decompose complex tasks into manageable steps, such as AI agents and high-level reinforcement learning. Recent advances in multimodal foundation-based approaches unify diverse input modalities-such as vision, language, and sensory data-into a cohesive decision-making process. Foundation models (FMs) have become pivotal in science and industry, transforming decision-making and research capabilities. Their large-scale, multimodal data-processing abilities foster adaptability and interdisciplinary breakthroughs across fields such as healthcare, life sciences, and education. This survey examines IDM's evolution, advanced paradigms with FMs and their transformative impact on decision-making across diverse scientific and industrial domains, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in building efficient, adaptive, and ethical decision systems.\"}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'MLSFF: Multi-level structural features fusion for multi-modal knowledge graph completion', 'abstract': 'With the rise of multi-modal methods, multi-modal knowledge graphs have become a better choice for storing human knowledge. However, knowledge graphs often suffer from the problem of incompleteness due to the infinite and constantly updating nature of knowledge, and thus the task of knowledge graph completion has been proposed. Existing multi-modal knowledge graph completion methods mostly rely on either embedding-based representations or graph neural networks, and there is still room for improvement in terms of interpretability and the ability to handle multi-hop tasks. Therefore, we propose a new method for multi-modal knowledge graph completion. Our method aims to learn multi-level graph structural features to fully explore hidden relationships within the knowledge graph and to improve reasoning accuracy. Specifically, we first use a Transformer architecture to separately learn about data representations for both the image and text modalities. Then, with the help of multimodal gating units, we filter out irrelevant information and perform feature fusion to obtain a unified encoding of knowledge representations. Furthermore, we extract multi-level path features using a width-adjustable sliding window and learn about structural feature information in the knowledge graph using graph convolutional operations. Finally, we use a scoring function to evaluate the probability of the truthfulness of encoded triplets and to complete the prediction task. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the model, we conduct experiments on two publicly available datasets, FB15K-237-IMG and WN18-IMG, and achieve improvements of 1.8 and 0.7%, respectively, in the Hits@1 metric.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton (Analysis of the 10 papers)\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the 10 papers.

    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem tackled by this research cluster is the completion and utilization of knowledge graphs—particularly multi-modal knowledge graphs—as foundational knowledge bases to support efficient and accurate reasoning, including in large language models (LLMs). The most central concepts revolve around 'knowledge graph completion,' 'knowledge graph,' 'graph completion,' and associated methods, revealing that augmenting incomplete knowledge representations with multi-modal and structural features is a core focus. Dominant methods include embedding-based representations, graph neural networks (e.g., graph convolutional networks), Transformer architectures for multi-modal encoding (text and image), and multi-level structural feature fusion to improve reasoning accuracy. The surveyed foundational work highlights advances integrating multi-modal inputs and foundation models aiming to enhance decision-making and reasoning by leveraging large-scale, adaptable knowledge bases.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite advances, existing approaches struggle with knowledge graph incompleteness due to the ever-growing nature of knowledge; multi-hop reasoning and interpretability remain challenging, especially in multi-modal contexts. The absence of bridge nodes in the local concept network indicates limited integration between core sub-themes, which may hinder holistic approaches combining knowledge graph learning with reasoning tasks. Moreover, no papers explicitly address how to seamlessly integrate these enriched knowledge graphs to enhance LLM long-term reasoning memory architectures, suggesting a methodological gap. External/Novel Gaps: The global context analysis reveals no identified 'hidden bridges' or cross-disciplinary connectors from the 10-paper cluster, indicating missed opportunities to incorporate advances from adjacent domains such as neuro-symbolic reasoning, continual learning, or cognitive memory models. For example, memory-augmented neural architectures or meta-learning frameworks could serve as hidden bridges to tackle long-term reasoning and efficient memory retrieval from knowledge bases—areas not currently connected to the local knowledge graph completion efforts.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate memory-augmented neural network architectures (from global fields like continual learning) with multi-modal knowledge graph completion methods (thematic island) to address the internal gap of efficient long-term memory and multi-hop reasoning in LLMs.\n\nOpportunity 2: Develop neuro-symbolic reasoning frameworks that bridge symbolic knowledge graphs with sub-symbolic foundation model embeddings, enhancing interpretability and completeness of knowledge representations, overcoming current limitations in interpretability highlighted in the foundational literature.\n\nOpportunity 3: Employ meta-learning techniques to dynamically adapt knowledge graph completion models to evolving domains and continuous knowledge updates, directly addressing the challenge of knowledge incompleteness and rapid knowledge change identified as a critical limitation in the surveyed methods."
