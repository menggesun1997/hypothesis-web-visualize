    "title": "Participatory Surveillance Data Augmentation for Bias-Resistant LLM Health Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Insufficient incorporation of community participation data in health surveillance leads to biased LLM health models that underrepresent vulnerable populations' perspectives, reducing adoption and fairness in conflict-affected regions.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal and external gaps related to technology adoption and community participation integration, expanding Opportunity 1 by innovating on data augmentation with participatory surveillance inputs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a data augmentation pipeline that integrates crowd-sourced participatory health surveillance reports (e.g., community mobile health inputs) into LLM training corpora. Employ privacy-preserving algorithms to safely include sensitive data. Additionally, design bias-correction layers that recalibrate LLM outputs based on demographic participation rates to mitigate over- or under-representation in generated responses.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect participatory surveillance data from digital platforms in conflict zones. 2) Anonymize and preprocess data to integrate with existing public health corpora. 3) Fine-tune LLMs on augmented datasets with bias-correction objectives. 4) Benchmark against LLMs trained on non-augmented datasets using fairness and representation metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What are the main barriers faced by ethnic minorities in disease reporting in conflict areas?\" Output: \"Barriers include mistrust in authorities and lack of accessible digital tools, as reported by community-driven surveillance data, highlighting need for inclusive outreach.\"",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct data augmentation causes model degradation, employ synthetic minority oversampling techniques or implement transfer learning from community participation classifiers to guide LLM fine-tuning."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lacks sufficient detail regarding the handling of data collection challenges in conflict zones, particularly ethical approvals, data reliability, and participant safety. Moreover, the plan does not clearly specify metrics for bias-correction effectiveness or how privacy-preserving algorithms will be validated within this pipeline. A more rigorous and operationalized experimental design is needed to ensure practical feasibility and reproducibility, including explicit evaluation protocols and contingency strategies for data scarcity or noise inherent in crowd-sourced participatory health surveillance data in sensitive regions. Strengthening this plan will significantly mitigate implementation risks and enhance credibility for adoption and deployment in real-world, high-stakes health contexts in conflict areas, directly addressing feasibility concerns linked to the complexity of the proposed method and setting. This should be a priority before proceeding to costly model training and benchmarking phases, ensuring the latter produce meaningful and reliable outcomes rather than uncertain exploratory results that may delay impactful contributions in biased health AI models for vulnerable populations in conflict zones, where trust and fairness are paramount but data is difficult to obtain and validate safely and ethically within such experimental designs and pipelines proposed here, ensuring thorough safeguarding of participant rights and data security compliance is also critical for acceptance and scalability of this research initiative in sensitive geopolitical contexts of the target domain and user groups, further integrating domain-specific constraints and best practices for participatory surveillance data collection methods in conflict-affected populations to underpin the entire methodological framework robustly and reliably in the experiment phase and beyond for the health LLM fine-tuning pipeline and envisioned bias-correction strategies to be tested rigorously with generalizable, reproducible, and ethically sound empirical data collection and validation strategies designed specifically for these environments and communities and their unique data characteristics and vulnerabilities."

          "feedback_content": "Given that prior work strongly connects components of this idea and novelty is rated only NOV-COMPETITIVE, you must concretely increase impact and distinctiveness by actively partnering with globally-recognized institutions involved in nutritional or health research like the International Union of Nutritional Sciences or the University Clinics of Kinshasa. For instance, collaborating with these organizations could enable access to validated, rich participatory surveillance datasets or co-developing annotation guidelines and participatory data collection frameworks that more accurately reflect marginalized voices in conflict zones. These collaborations could also facilitate incorporating clinical and nutritional expertise into the bias-correction layers, enhancing model relevance and adoption. Explicitly integrating such global partnerships and domain expertise would not only enrich the training corpus but also strengthen ethical governance, increase generalizability, and markedly boost the project's novelty, real-world impact, and credibility among both local stakeholders and the international research community. This approach also strategically leverages unique contextual expertise and resources that cannot be readily replicated, helping distinguish this work from existing LLM bias-mitigation efforts through a globally-informed, culturally sensitive participatory surveillance augmentation paradigm focused on vulnerable populations in conflict-affected settings."
