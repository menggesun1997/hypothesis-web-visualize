    "title": "Community-Grounded Multimodal Knowledge Bases for LLM Fairness",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs suffer from bias due to underrepresentation of socio-economic and ethnically diverse communities, especially in conflict-affected and economically fragile settings. There is a lack of integrative frameworks combining fiscal decentralization, public health data, and community participation to mitigate bias in LLM outputs.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient integration of distributed systems with domain-specific knowledge bases and the external gap of missing community participation frameworks. This aligns with Opportunity 1 from the landscape map, leveraging hidden bridges between economic governance, health surveillance, and community participation to improve fairness.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel AI-driven multimodal knowledge base that fuses datasets on fiscal decentralization policies, infectious disease surveillance, and community engagement metrics (e.g., participatory governance surveys). Use graph neural networks (GNNs) to contextualize relationships between economic policies and health outcomes at local levels. Integrate this knowledge base with LLM prompting mechanisms to enforce fairness-aware response constraints, ensuring representation and mitigating ethnic and socio-economic bias.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets: fiscal decentralization indicators, health surveillance records, community participation surveys from conflict and post-conflict zones. 2) Construct a multimodal knowledge graph combining these datasets with socio-economic and ethnic features. 3) Train GNN encoders on this graph to learn latent representations. 4) Fine-tune LLMs with augmented context injection from the knowledge base. Baselines: standard LLMs without knowledge base. Metrics: fairness metrics (Demographic Parity, Equalized Odds), factuality, bias reduction, model calibration.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What measures should be prioritized to control a disease outbreak in a conflict-affected region with diverse ethnic groups?\" Expected Output: \"Prioritize community-led surveillance combined with decentralized fiscal support ensuring equitable resource allocation to underserved ethnic communities, mitigating historical biases seen in previous interventions.\"",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If GNN integration underperforms, fallback to simpler rule-based knowledge injection based on community participation thresholds. Alternatively, enrich datasets with synthetic minority data augmentation or incorporate human-in-the-loop fine-tuning to improve fairness outcomes."

        "title": "Community-Grounded Multimodal Knowledge Bases for LLM Fairness with Data Auditing and Adaptive Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit socio-economic and ethnic biases, particularly in conflict-affected and economically fragile regions, due to underrepresentation and skewed data sources. While combining fiscal decentralization policies, infectious disease surveillance, and community participation metrics into a multimodal knowledge base presents a promising avenue to enhance fairness, critical challenges exist regarding data availability, compatibility, and quality. Many such datasets in targeted regions suffer from scarcity, missingness, noise, and latent confounders, which can impair the integrity of knowledge graphs and bias mitigation efforts. Therefore, a rigorous examination of dataset representativeness, completeness, and provenance is essential prior to integration. Addressing these foundational issues is vital to ensure that fairness gains from the proposed approach are genuine and impactful, rather than illusory or partial.",
        "Motivation": "Existing approaches largely overlook the foundational risks posed by heterogeneous, incomplete, and unrepresentative datasets in socio-economically fragile contexts when aiming to mitigate bias in LLMs. Our proposal fills this gap by systematically auditing the underlying datasets, enabling adaptive integration strategies that account for data quality variations—thus enhancing both internal coherence and external social relevance. Furthermore, by incorporating concepts from digital media ecology and human-computer interaction, we innovatively bridge economic governance, public health surveillance, and participatory community data within an open-source framework to improve fairness-aware LLM responses. This approach advances beyond prior works by pioneering a scientifically grounded, data-sensitive pathway to deploy multimodal knowledge bases for equitable AI in sensitive socio-political contexts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "First, we will perform comprehensive data audits and feasibility analyses on fiscal decentralization indicators, infectious disease surveillance, and community participation datasets from conflict-affected and economically fragile regions, utilizing metadata analysis, missingness quantification, provenance verification, and bias detection algorithms. To address identified data gaps and noise, we will employ adaptive data integration strategies, including confidence-weighted feature encoding and synthetic minority oversampling where applicable. Our knowledge base construction leverages an open-source multimodal knowledge graph platform reflecting the digital media ecology paradigm, wherein diverse data modalities are dynamically interconnected with provenance and uncertainty annotations. We will design graph neural networks (GNNs) augmented with modality-specific encoders capable of handling heterogeneous feature types and missing data using attention and imputation techniques. Embeddings will be evaluated for capturing fairness-relevant patterns verified through ablation probing per modality. Subsequently, we propose a novel fine-tuning regime for LLMs that incorporates fairness-constrained prompting via an interactive human-computer interface, enabling transparent context injection grounded in our knowledge base. This HCI element supports iterative feedback and error correction, further improving bias mitigation efficacy. The entire pipeline will be developed as open-source software fostering transparency and community involvement, aligning with digital media ecology principles.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Audit & Feasibility: Conduct detailed metadata analyses for each dataset, quantify missingness and noise levels, and assess socio-economic and ethnic representativeness using stratified statistical summaries and bias quantification methods. 2) Dataset Preprocessing & Adaptive Integration: Implement confidence-weighted feature schemes and synthetic minority data augmentation based on audit results. Develop protocols for multimodal alignment incorporating modality-specific feature normalization and imputation. 3) Knowledge Graph Construction: Build the multimodal knowledge graph with provenance and uncertainty annotations on an open-source platform; perform qualitative verification. 4) GNN Modeling: Train modality-aware GNN encoders utilizing attention mechanisms and dropout to handle missing data and noise; use stratified validation splits and k-fold cross-validation ensuring fair representation of minority groups. 5) Evaluation & Ablation: Assess embeddings for fairness relevance using statistical parity difference, equalized odds metrics, and embedding interpretability analyses. Conduct ablation studies by systematically removing data modalities to isolate impact. 6) LLM Fine-tuning & Interactive Context Injection: Develop a human-in-the-loop interface for fairness-constrained prompt augmentation; measure bias reduction and factual consistency pre- and post-fine-tuning; monitor computational resource usage to evaluate feasibility. 7) Baselines & Controls: Compare against standard LLMs without knowledge base augmentation and simpler rule-based knowledge injection models. 8) Fallback Criteria & Plan: Define empirical thresholds for GNN performance drop or data insufficiency triggering fallback to rule-based expert systems or enhanced human-in-the-loop interventions; document fallback scenarios and corrective responses.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What measures should be prioritized to control a disease outbreak in a conflict-affected region with diverse ethnic groups?\" Expected Output: \"Prioritize community-led surveillance tailored to local participatory governance structures, combined with decentralized fiscal support ensuring equitable resource allocation that consciously addresses historical ethnic disparities and data limitations, as signaled by confidence measures in the knowledge base.\" Additional Test Examples: (a) Queries evaluating fairness metrics explicated in responses, showcasing transparent trade-offs when data paucity limits decision confidence. (b) Scenario-based prompts engaging the human-computer interface to iteratively refine responses grounded in local media ecology and community inputs.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If GNN training or integration underperforms due to data scarcity, high noise, or computational constraints exceeding feasibility thresholds, we will provision fallback to a hybrid rule-based knowledge injection protocol utilizing expert-validated thresholds on community participation and fiscal decentralization metrics. Additionally, we will expand synthetic minority data augmentation and strengthen human-in-the-loop mechanisms with domain experts via the HCI interface to manually guide prompt corrections and fairness calibration. Failures or limitations will be explicitly logged and communicated through the open-source platform to inform future dataset improvement efforts and community engagement strategies."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that combining fiscal decentralization policies, infectious disease data, and community participation metrics into one multimodal knowledge base can effectively reduce LLM bias regarding socio-economic and ethnic diversity. However, the underlying assumption that these heterogeneous datasets are compatible and sufficiently representative—especially in conflict-affected and economically fragile regions—is not fully justified. There is a risk that data scarcity, quality issues, or latent confounders could limit the intended fairness gains. The authors should explicitly examine data availability, representativeness, and possible biases in each dataset before integration and consider the effect of missing or noisy data on the knowledge graph and GNN representations. Clearer justification or preliminary data audits would strengthen this core assumption's soundness and motivate the proposed method better. This is critical because if the foundational datasets are insufficient or biased, the downstream fairness improvements may be illusory or partial, undermining the whole approach's validity and impact potential. Please add discussion, data audits, or feasibility analyses demonstrating this approach's foundational viability for the targeted regions and groups in 'Problem_Statement' and 'Proposed_Method'. This is a must-fix to solidify the paper’s scientific foundation and credibility at the core methodological level."

          "feedback_content": "While the experimental plan is broadly logical, the practicality and scientific soundness of training GNN encoders on combined multimodal knowledge graphs from highly heterogeneous socio-economic, health, and governance datasets need deeper clarification. Specific concerns include: how the different modalities and feature types will be aligned in a unified graph, how missing or unreliable data will be handled in training, and whether the graph scale and complexity are manageable for GNN training given real-world data limitations. The plan also lacks details on validation splits, procedures to evaluate whether GNN embeddings truly capture fairness-relevant relationships, and ablation studies to isolate the impact of each data modality. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs with augmented context injection requires clearer technical protocols and computational feasibility estimations. The fallback plan could benefit from explicit criteria for fallback triggers and concrete alternatives. Addressing these feasibility gaps by adding concrete experimental protocols, data preprocessing details, and risk mitigation strategies would greatly improve the credibility and reproducibility of the work. Please update the 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' accordingly to make the empirical approach both scientifically robust and practically feasible."
