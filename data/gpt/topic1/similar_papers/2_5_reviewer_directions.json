    "title": "Cognitive Effort-Aware Prompt Scheduling for Enhanced LLM Learning Efficiency",
    "Problem_Statement": "Few-shot learning in LLMs lacks mechanisms to dynamically adjust prompt exposure based on modeled cognitive effort, limiting learning efficiency and robustness.",
    "Motivation": "Capitalizes on external novel gaps by incorporating cognitive effort indices from behavioral and physiological data into prompt scheduling algorithms, an innovation beyond current static prompt exposure methods.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive prompt scheduler conditioned on modeled cognitive effort signals that modulate the frequency, complexity, and spacing of fine-tuning prompts during few-shot learning. This scheduler organizes prompt delivery to simulate human-like spaced repetition and cognitive load management, promoting better knowledge retention and transfer in LLMs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Formalize cognitive effort metrics from datasets. 2) Implement scheduler controlling prompt batch composition and timing during fine-tuning. 3) Fine-tune LLMs on benchmark tasks with adaptive vs. uniform prompt exposure. 4) Evaluate in terms of learning speed, final accuracy, and generalization. 5) Analyze effects of different cognitive effort thresholds on performance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Mapping science concepts with scheduling modulated by effort estimations. Expected output: Faster convergence and comparable or superior accuracy compared to baseline without adaptive scheduling.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "Fallback to fixed spaced repetition schedules inspired by psychology literature. Alternatively, employ reinforcement learning to optimize prompt scheduling policies."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an adaptive prompt scheduler modulated by cognitive effort signals, yet it lacks a precise description of how these signals will be quantitatively modeled and integrated into the scheduling algorithm. Clarify the computational representation of cognitive effort derived from behavioral and physiological data, and explicitly detail the scheduler's mechanism — e.g., how prompt complexity, frequency, and spacing decisions are algorithmically determined based on effort metrics. This clarity is essential to assess the soundness and replicability of the approach reliably, ensuring the mechanism's validity beyond analogy to human cognition alone, which can be quite complex and noisy in practice. Consider providing pseudo-code or a formal model to concretize this key aspect within the Proposed_Method section to strengthen soundness and credibility of the approach before experimentation begins."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The experiment plan is broadly reasonable but under-specifies critical practical considerations that affect feasibility. Step 1 mentions formalizing cognitive effort metrics from datasets, but these datasets, their size, type, and availability are not elucidated, especially for combined behavioral and physiological data that may be rare or difficult to align with prompt scheduling in LLM fine-tuning tasks. Additionally, the plan doesn’t address how the noise or variability in cognitive effort signals will be handled during training. Provide more concrete details on data sources, preprocessing pipelines, and validation protocols for cognitive effort modeling. Also, clarify the computational budget, expected training time, and baseline models to ensure the experimental workload is achievable within typical research resource constraints. Strengthening these elements will improve confidence in the practical execution and reproducibility of the study."
