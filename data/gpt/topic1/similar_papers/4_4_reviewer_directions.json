    "title": "Continual Meta-Symbolic Learner for Dynamic Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Integration",
    "Problem_Statement": "Neuro-symbolic models for knowledge reasoning struggle to adapt continually to evolving knowledge bases with incomplete graphs, limiting their applicability in real-world dynamic domains.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the external gaps by combining meta-learning with neuro-symbolic frameworks (bridging Opportunity 2 and 3) to achieve adaptive, interpretable reasoning on evolving knowledge bases supporting LLMs' long-term memory.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a continual meta-symbolic learner that meta-learns logic rules and embeddings jointly and can adapt with few new examples to changes in knowledge graphs. It incorporates continual learning strategies to prevent catastrophic forgetting and updates neuro-symbolic models online as new knowledge arrives.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Use temporal multi-modal knowledge graph datasets with evolving facts. 2) Construct neuro-symbolic learner combining differentiable logic with neural embeddings. 3) Implement continual adaptation with meta-gradient updates. 4) Measure adaptation speed, reasoning accuracy, interpretability, and forgetting rates compared to static neuro-symbolic models.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Incremental addition of new relations in a biomedical knowledge graph. Output: Updated reasoning paths that correctly incorporate new drug-disease interactions with explanations without degradation on older knowledge.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If joint meta-learning is unstable, separate symbolic rule induction and embedding updates with knowledge distillation to maintain old knowledge and meta-learn only symbolic components."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes a joint meta-learning approach to simultaneously learn logic rules and neural embeddings for continual adaptation. However, the mechanism by which the neuro-symbolic learner integrates these components, particularly the interplay between meta-gradient updates for both facets, is underspecified. Clarifying the architectural details, how differentiable logic co-trains with embeddings, and how catastrophic forgetting is mitigated at a mechanistic level would significantly strengthen the submission's soundness. This clarity is critical, as the complexity of jointly updating symbolic rules and embeddings online can introduce instability and convergence challenges that are only lightly acknowledged in the fallback plan, without detailed mitigation strategies or prior evidence of feasibility in the neuro-symbolic continual learning literature. This gap needs addressing to convince reviewers of the method's viability and rigor of core assumptions about meta-learning within neuro-symbolic systems in dynamic settings.  Provide a more detailed method schematic or algorithmic description and discuss expected challenges in stability and convergence explicitly, including how meta-gradients are computed and reconciled between the symbolic and embedding components during continual updates, to demonstrate clear methodological soundness and innovation beyond existing neuro-symbolic and continual learning approaches."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screened novelty verdict (NOV-COMPETITIVE) and the domain of neuro-symbolic continual meta-learning, we recommend explicitly integrating concepts from 'multi-modal knowledge graph' and 'vision-language pre-training' to broaden the method's applicability and novelty. For instance, extending the continual meta-symbolic learner to support multi-modal knowledge graphs (e.g., incorporating textual, visual, and relational data) and leveraging pre-training paradigms from vision-language models could enhance reasoning robustness and generalization in multi-modal dynamic environments. This would create a compelling link between neuro-symbolic methods and state-of-the-art representation learning frameworks, positioning the work to contribute toward artificial general intelligence goals with enriched long-term memory for diverse modalities. Furthermore, demonstrating zero-shot generalization capabilities on evolving multi-modal knowledge bases could elevate the impact and competitiveness of the work within the community. We suggest exploring how recent advances in vision-language pre-training architectures and multi-modal graph representations can be synergistically combined with the continual meta-learning approach outlined to significantly boost both novelty and impact."
