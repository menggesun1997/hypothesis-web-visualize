    "title": "Joint Representation Learning Framework Combining Knowledge Graphs and Scene Graphs for Explainable LLM Contextualization",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current approaches fail to tightly integrate heterogeneous knowledge graphs with scene graph generation methods, limiting cross-modal relational reasoning and explainability within LLM contextualization frameworks.",
    "Motivation": "Targeting external gap about integrating vision-language models and graph structured knowledge, this research synthesizes knowledge graphs and scene graphs into a joint representation space, enabling explainable, contextually rich LLM generation. It addresses internal gap (b) and opportunity 1 by unifying graph modalities for multi-granularity reasoning.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Propose a dual-graph embedding framework that encodes knowledge graphs (KG) and vision-language scene graphs (SG) into a shared latent space via contrastive and graph alignment learning. Fusion layers in PLMs query this joint space dynamically during generation with relational attention modules. This leads to improved multi-hop inferencing, transparent knowledge attribution, and enhanced task performance on multimodal benchmarks.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Datasets: Visual Genome + relevant KG datasets (e.g., ConceptNet, biomedical KGs). 2) Models: Pretrained PLMs augmented with joint KG-SG encoders. 3) Baselines: Separate KG or SG embeddings in RAG, no joint training. 4) Metrics: Task accuracy on VQA, report generation, explainability evaluations via graph node attribution.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Image-text QA task asking, \"What is the relationship between the person and the object they hold?\" Expected Output: Generated answer referencing joint KG-SG reasoning highlighting object-person interaction with improved interpretability.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If joint embedding learning underperforms, explore staged training with frozen KG or SG embeddings, or attention weighting mechanisms to balance graph contributions dynamically."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a dual-graph embedding framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KG) and scene graphs (SG) via contrastive and graph alignment learning, along with relational attention modules in transformer-based PLMs during generation. However, the description lacks critical mechanistic details that underpin this integration's success. For example, how exactly are the heterogeneous graph structures aligned in the shared latent space? How does the contrastive learning objective ensure semantic equivalence or complementarity between KG and SG embeddings? The mechanism of query-based dynamic fusion within the PLM's layers is asserted but not elaborated â€” is this attention designed to attend over KG and SG nodes simultaneously or sequentially? Clarifying these components with more concrete architectural or algorithmic specifics, referencing potential prior works or theoretical rationales, would strengthen the soundness by showing the method is well-founded and implementable beyond a conceptual sketch. Including diagrams or pseudocode in the next iteration would aid clarity and confidence in the approach's feasibility and rigor as well as help differentiate it from competitive existing methods in this mature research space. This refinement is essential to establish that the proposed integrations are more than incremental and can be effectively operationalized for explainable multi-hop reasoning within LLM contextualization frameworks.

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the broad application domain, a concrete way to augment impact and novelty is to incorporate 'commonsense reasoning' and 'multi-modal fusion' concepts explicitly. For example, extend the joint KG-SG embedding framework to support dynamic human-robot interaction scenarios where multimodal inputs (vision, language, action context) require real-time, explainable reasoning about object affordances and intentions, grounded in commonsense knowledge graphs. By integrating temporal or interactive dimensions, the framework can showcase generalizability beyond static image-text tasks (e.g., VQA), thus broadening impact. Leveraging 'multi-agent' or 'generative artificial intelligence' concepts could lead to adaptive, interactive contextualization in multi-modal AI agents, opening new avenues for explainability and reasoning in real-world environments. You may consider incorporating these globally-linked domains in the experiment plan and test cases to position your contribution distinctly in a competitive landscape.
