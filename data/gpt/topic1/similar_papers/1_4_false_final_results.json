    "title": "Adaptive Multi-Task Transfer Learning with Dynamic Expert Modules for Clinical NLP",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing transfer learning approaches for clinical LLM fine-tuning do not fully capitalize on simultaneous learning of multiple domain-specific tasks nor dynamically adapt to new target tasks without retraining entire models.",
    "Motivation": "Innovates on the internal gap of siloed fixed architectures by combining multi-task learning with expert module routing obtained via attention mechanisms, inspired by wider deep learning advances, to improve flexibility and efficiency in clinical NLP task adaptation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Architect a modular LLM fine-tuning framework embedding multiple domain expert modules specialized per task, dynamically weighted during inference by a gating attention mechanism conditioned on input. Utilize knowledge base embeddings as input constraints to expert routing decisions. Supports continual adaptation by adding new expert modules without retraining backbone representations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect a suite of clinical NLP tasks with annotated corpora. 2) Pretrain the backbone LLM and develop expert modules fine-tuned per task. 3) Train routing attention gates jointly optimizing overall multi-task objectives. 4) Compare against monolithic multi-task and single-task baselines. 5) Evaluate adaptability and performance on added new clinical tasks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical note describing multiple phenomena (e.g., medication and adverse effects). Expected Output: Expert module activations focusing on respective tasks, producing high-quality multi-faceted annotations with efficient inference.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If gating mechanisms do not adequately differentiate experts, explore reinforcement learning for module selection or incorporate task metadata embeddings to assist routing."
