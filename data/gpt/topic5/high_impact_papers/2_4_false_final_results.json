    "title": "Contextual Ethical Recovery Policies via Reinforcement Learning in Conversational Agents",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs in customer service agents lack adaptive recovery mechanisms that incorporate social and ethical context after adversarial failures, resulting in poor user experience and loss of trust.",
    "Motivation": "Extends high-potential Opportunity 2 by using reinforcement learning to develop contextualized reparative policies rather than static scripted responses, enabling dynamic, socially appropriate recovery that adapts to user feedback and context.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where: (1) The primary agent performs customer service; (2) An ethical policy agent dynamically monitors and scores conversational outputs for social appropriateness and ethical alignment post-failure; (3) Feedback is used to optimize recovery strategies including apology, explanation, and corrective dialog turns; (4) The system learns from simulated and real-world interactions balancing task success with social recovery effectiveness.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect and annotate conversational datasets with failure and reparative dialog instances. 2) Simulate adversarial failures and recovery interaction scenarios. 3) Train RL policies using reward functions blending task success, ethical adherence, and user trust scores. 4) Evaluate with human and simulated interlocutors measuring recovery success, social appropriateness, and trust restoration.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Agent responds incorrectly due to adversarial input. Expected Output: Dynamic interaction including recognized failure, tailored apology, clarification questions and accurate final answer restoring user satisfaction and trust.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If RL training proves unstable, bootstrap from scripted policies augmented by supervised learning on reparative dialog data or use rule-based fallback recovery triggered by failure detectors."
