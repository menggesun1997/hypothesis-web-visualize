        "title": "Hardware-Aware Knowledge Distillation Targeting Energy-Constrained Scientific Mining with FPGA Adaptivity and Self-Supervised Pretraining",
        "Problem_Statement": "Knowledge distillation from large LLMs to smaller models typically neglects fine-grained hardware energy profiles and configurability, resulting in suboptimal deployment on energy-constrained scientific mining platforms such as edge GPUs and FPGA-based systems. Existing approaches lack mechanisms to efficiently incorporate real-time, accurate hardware energy feedback into the distillation process, limiting the ability to dynamically optimize for both ecological efficiency and task performance.",
        "Motivation": "To address the competitive but limited novelty of hardware-aware distillation, this work proposes a novel interdisciplinary framework that tightly integrates multi-objective knowledge distillation with configurable hardware platforms (FPGAs) and advanced self-supervised learning techniques. By enabling real-time, fine-grained energy feedback loops within the training process and leveraging self-supervised pretraining to reduce labeled data dependency, this approach advances both the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and adaptability of student models to diverse and evolving hardware constraints in scientific text and multi-modal mining scenarios. The solution also expands applicability beyond static platforms to dynamic, partially reconfigurable hardware, offering superior energy savings and scientific value.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a Hardware-Aware Multi-Objective Distillation (HAMOD) framework that jointly optimizes task accuracy and hardware energy consumption incorporating the following innovations:\n\n1. Multi-Objective Loss with Energy Normalization: Construct a composite loss \\(\\mathcal{L} = \\alpha\\mathcal{L}_{accuracy} + \\beta\\mathcal{L}_{energy}\\) where \\(\\mathcal{L}_{energy}\\) is derived from normalized real-time energy consumption measurements. Normalization uses a moving baseline from idle and peak power states to stabilize gradients.\n\n2. Efficient Real-Time Energy Profiling Integration: Design a profiling middleware interfaced via lightweight APIs to measure energy usage per batch on target hardware (FPGAs and edge GPUs) with minimal latency (<5% training overhead). Energy data is asynchronously buffered and smoothed via exponential moving averages to mitigate noise.\n\n3. FPGA Partial Reconfiguration-Aware Architecture Search: Incorporate a dynamic Neural Architecture Search (NAS) module guided by hardware metrics that adaptively selects and partially reconfigures FPGA bitstreams to optimize sub-module energy and throughput in response to feedback during training.\n\n4. Self-Supervised Pretraining Module: Integrate masked language modeling and contrastive learning objectives in a self-supervised pretraining phase on unlabeled scientific corpora to reduce labeled data dependence and improve generalization on distillation tasks.\n\n5. Multi-Hardware Targeting: Extend the HAMOD pipeline to handle heterogeneous platforms (neuromorphic chips, edge GPUs, and FPGAs) exploiting each's unique energy profiles and constraints with flexible weighting strategies.\n\nAlgorithmic Framework (Pseudo-Code Outline):\n```\nInitialize student model\nPretrain with self-supervised objectives\nfor each distillation epoch:\n    for each batch:\n        Obtain teacher outputs\n        Measure energy consumption asynchronously via profiling API\n        Normalize energy metrics using baseline statistics\n        Compute composite loss: accuracy + weighted energy\n        Backpropagate loss to update student parameters\n    Update NAS controller with averaged energy + accuracy metrics\n    Adapt FPGA bitstream configuration if applicable\n```\nThis tightly coupled hardware-in-the-loop training methodology ensures stable convergence and reproducible energy-accuracy trade-offs on configurable platforms.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Benchmark target hardware platforms: perform detailed energy and latency profiling on neuromorphic chips, edge GPUs, and state-of-the-art FPGAs with partial reconfiguration capability.\n2. Develop and validate efficient real-time energy measurement middleware to integrate into distillation pipelines.\n3. Implement the HAMOD framework including multi-objective loss, NAS-guided FPGA reconfiguration, and self-supervised pretraining modules.\n4. Apply to diverse scientific mining tasks including entity recognition, relation extraction, and explore multi-modal mining (e.g., combining text and sensor data).\n5. Evaluate distilled student models on accuracy, energy consumption, latency, and hardware reconfiguration overhead.\n6. Compare against baseline distillation approaches ignoring hardware metrics and static-fpga methods.\n7. Ablation studies on energy weighting, NAS strategies, and self-supervision impact.\n8. Release open-source pipeline and hardware profiling tools for community validation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Set of scientific abstracts and associated sensor data for multi-modal entity extraction.\nExpected Output: A student model distilled from a large LLM achieving at least 95% of teacher accuracy while reducing energy consumption by ≥ 25% on target FPGA hardware through adaptive bitstream reconfiguration, compared to baseline distillation ignoring hardware feedback.\n\nAdditional Test: Student model pre-trained with self-supervised objectives exhibits improved accuracy with 10–20% fewer labeled samples, maintaining energy efficiency.\n\nLatency measurements show under 10ms per inference on edge GPU setups to meet real-time processing demands.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time hardware-in-the-loop integration introduces instabilities or excessive overhead, fallback to surrogate energy prediction models trained offline from extensive profiling data to approximate energy metrics during training.\n\nIf FPGA partial reconfiguration control is limited or too slow, restrict to static FPGA architectures using hardware-aware pruning and quantization guided by offline energy profiles.\n\nFor insufficient labeled data, emphasize self-supervised pretraining as a standalone step prior to distillation.\n\nIn case self-supervised methods yield limited gains, incorporate semi-supervised fine-tuning or knowledge transfer from related domains to enhance generalization."

Specifically, how energy measurements will be captured efficiently without excessive latency or noise, how these hardware metrics are normalized or weighted alongside accuracy losses, and how the architecture search dynamically adapts to hardware feedback are not well elaborated. Providing a concrete algorithmic framework or pseudo-code describing the multi-objective loss construction, energy profiling integration, and iterative optimization methodology is essential to establish soundness and reproducibility of the approach, especially since hardware-in-the-loop training is non-trivial and can introduce stability and convergence challenges. Clarifying these mechanisms would greatly strengthen the technical validity and feasibility of the method proposed in the “Proposed_Method” section."
