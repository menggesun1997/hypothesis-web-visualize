    "title": "Brain-Computer Interface Enhanced Interactive LLMs for Accessible, Bias-Aware Healthcare Decision Support",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM-powered healthcare tools struggle with accessibility, particularly for users with physical or cognitive impairments, and fail to incorporate user feedback seamlessly to reduce bias or misinterpretation in real-time.",
    "Motivation": "Leverages the novel cross-disciplinary hidden bridge linking brain-computer interfaces (BCI), human-computer interaction, and AI media studies to develop an unprecedented multimodal interactive healthcare decision support system. This approach addresses external gap by incorporating neurophysiological user feedback to adapt AI outputs towards fairness and comprehension in situ.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an adaptive healthcare decision interface integrating EEG-based BCI sensors that capture user cognitive load, confusion, or emotional responses while interacting with LLM-generated outputs. These signals feed back into the LLM dialog manager, triggering real-time adaptation of explanations and bias mitigation strategies. The system combines AI, BCI signal processing, and multimedia communication to personalize and enhance fairness in decision support for more inclusive clinical environments.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Recruit participants with accessibility needs.\n2. Assemble datasets combining healthcare decision tasks and user BCI recordings.\n3. Develop LLM with integrated BCI feedback control loops.\n4. Train multimodal fusion models linking BCI signals and AI explanation styles.\n5. Test adaptive system on simulated clinical scenarios comparing to static LLM assistance.\n6. Evaluate effectiveness via task performance, bias reduction, and user satisfaction metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM suggests diagnostic options.\nUser shows cognitive overload signal via BCI.\nSystem detects this and switches to simpler explanation mode with additional bias disclaimers.\nExpected output: Reduced cognitive burden, increased trust, and clearer understanding leading to better decision outcomes.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If BCI signals are noisy or unreliable, incorporate alternative physiological signals (eye-tracking, heart rate) or explicit user feedback buttons. Alternatively, simulate BCI feedback with proxy signals during development."
