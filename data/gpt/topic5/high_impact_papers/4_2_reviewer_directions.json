    "title": "Explainability-Driven Adaptive Calibration for Transparent Legal NLP Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of transparent and interpretable calibration methods in legal domain LLMs impedes trust and accountability due to opaque domain-shift mitigation strategies and high risks of misinterpretation.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the critical internal gap on interpretability in fine-tuning methods by integrating state-of-the-art explainable AI (XAI) paradigms with structured domain knowledge to create transparent adaptive calibration strategies that justify model predictions in legal contexts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an adaptive calibration framework that combines knowledge-graph-aware neural modules with inherently interpretable components (e.g., attention transparency, counterfactual reasoning). This framework outputs provenance-enriched explanations alongside model predictions for legal document classification and extraction tasks.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement the adaptive calibration framework integrating legal knowledge graphs and attention visualization tools. 2) Fine-tune on annotated legal datasets with domain-shift scenarios. 3) Measure calibration improvement, explanation fidelity (using metrics like sufficiency and comprehensiveness), and user trust in expert panels simulating legal scenario workflows.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Legal brief text with ambiguous terminology. Output: Classified document label with detailed explanation citing specific knowledge graph nodes and attention patterns, helping users understand model reasoning and domain calibration adjustments.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If explanations lack clarity, fallback to simplified modular explanations using symbolic rule extraction or leveraging surrogate models trained on the calibrated outputs to generate human-understandable rationales."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines appropriate components but lacks clarity on key practical details vital for feasibility. Specifically, it should explicitly describe how domain-shift scenarios will be constructed or sourced in annotated legal datasets, and how user trust will be quantitatively measured in expert panels. Consider specifying the size and diversity of legal datasets, the exact explainability metrics thresholds that define success, and protocols for recruiting and evaluating expert users to ensure the trust assessment is robust and reproducible. Adding these specifics will strengthen the plan's scientific rigor and practical achievability by making evaluation criteria and datasets concrete rather than broadly stated targets or concepts alone, thus improving feasibility appraisal and execution confidence in a peer review or funding setting. This is critical because legal-domain NLP calibration hinges on subtle distribution shifts and stakeholder trust metrics that are non-trivial to operationalize and must be clearly defined upfront to enable meaningful validation of the approach's effectiveness and usability in realistic workflows and settings, not just on synthetic or simplified datasets or trust proxies alone.  Address this by detailing data sourcing/preparation, domain-shift design, quantitative trust measurement methodology, and baseline comparison approaches within the Experiment_Plan section itself to close this critical feasibility gap early on in the proposal, improving the method's readiness and confidence for practical deployment and acceptance in the legal AI domain.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating and the existence of strong prior connections between explainability, calibration, and legal NLP, to elevate this work's impact and novelty, I suggest explicitly integrating concepts from 'trustworthy AI' and 'data quality framework' into the adaptive calibration framework. For instance, incorporate systematic assessment and feedback loops leveraging data quality metrics specific to legal texts to dynamically adjust model calibration, tied with trustworthy AI principles like fairness, robustness, and transparency guarantees. This can be operationalized through modular components that not only provide provenance-aware explanations but also audit model predictions against standards or policies distilled from legal knowledge graphs, ensuring compliance and interpretability holistically. Such multi-dimensional integration can broaden the scope beyond pure calibration and explanation â€” positioning the framework as an end-to-end trustworthy AI solution for legal NLP. Additionally, leveraging attention mechanism advances from clinical document classification or convolutional attention networks could enrich interpretability and calibration simultaneously, borrowing best practices from intelligence and health system applications. Explicitly positioning this cross-domain integration in the Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan can differentiate this research in a crowded field and enhance its utility and impact significantly, attracting broader interest from AI and legal communities alike."
