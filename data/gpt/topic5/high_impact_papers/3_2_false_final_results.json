    "title": "Decentralized Edge-Inference Networks for Scientific Language Model Efficiency",
    "Problem_Statement": "Centralized large language model inference and retraining for scientific data mining incur high energy and latency costs due to enormous data movement and heavy computation centralized in data centers.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the external gap revealed by the hidden bridge linking 'hardware approach' and 'robotics research,' this project proposes leveraging mobile edge computing and self-driving laboratory concepts to distribute LLM inference and retraining closer to data sources, enhancing scalability and energy efficiency.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a decentralized architecture where lightweight distilled language models operate on edge computing nodes collocated with scientific instruments or repositories. These models perform preliminary mining and selectively forward challenging cases to central servers. Model retraining distributes updates from central to edge nodes asynchronously, using federated learning techniques adapted for scientific literature data heterogeneity. The system incorporates adaptive load balancing based on resource availability and data locality.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select scientific datasets distributed in multiple locations.\n2. Implement distilled language models suitable for edge hardware.\n3. Develop federated learning pipeline for model updates.\n4. Simulate data streaming from scientific instruments for real-time mining.\n5. Evaluate performance, energy consumption, and communication overhead compared to central inference.\n6. Analyze adaptability in dynamic network and resource conditions.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Distributed streams of experimental reports from multiple separate labs.\nExpected Output: Edge nodes extract and annotate key findings locally, forwarding ambiguous cases to central server, achieving a 40% reduction in data movement and 30% lower energy costs compared to centralized model processing.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated training convergence is poor, fallback to periodic batched updating of edge nodes from centralized retraining. Explore model quantization and pruning for further edge efficiency gains."
