    "title": "Hybrid Socio-Technical Adversarial Training Framework for Agent Robustness",
    "Problem_Statement": "Traditional adversarial training methods for LLMs in autonomous agents lack socio-technical context embedding, limiting robustness in real-world user-interactions, especially where online translation and digital labour fairness intersect.",
    "Motivation": "Recognizes and fills the critical internal gap by synthesizing socio-technical fairness constraints with adversarial robustness training, producing agents robust not only to linguistic perturbations but also to socio-economic adversarial manipulations embedded in language.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid adversarial training pipeline that: (1) Generates adversarial examples blending linguistic manipulations and socio-technical fairness violations (e.g., unfair labor practices phrasing); (2) Trains agents to detect and correctly handle such multi-dimensional adversarial inputs reconstructing fair, equitable responses; (3) Employs contrastive learning between fair and adversarial socio-technical example sets; (4) Incorporates human-in-the-loop evaluation with laborers and domain experts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct adversarial benchmark datasets combining linguistic and socio-technical adversarial samples. 2) Train LLM agents with hybrid adversarial objectives. 3) Benchmark against standard adversarial training baselines measuring robustness, fairness, and translation quality metrics. 4) Conduct user studies with diverse workers and customers assessing fairness perception and robustness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Adversarial user input mixing misleading translation with language implying labor exploitation. Expected Output: Agent identifies adversarial cues, denies generating unfair content or biased translations, outputs socially responsible and fair response with explanation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If hybrid adversarial training harms model convergence, separate training phases with gradual integration or ensemble model architectures balancing fairness and robustness could be employed."

        "title": "Hybrid Socio-Technical Adversarial Training Framework with Emotion-Aware Contrastive Learning for Agent Robustness",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current adversarial training approaches for large language model (LLM)-based autonomous agents insufficiently integrate socio-technical contexts, leading to vulnerabilities against complex adversarial inputs that combine linguistic noise, socio-economic injustice cues, and affective manipulation. This gap limits agent robustness and fairness in realistic, multilingual user interactions, especially in domains involving digital labor and online translation.",
        "Motivation": "While advances in adversarial training enhance linguistic robustness, and fairness-aware methods promote socio-technical equity, existing solutions rarely unify these dimensions at the model architecture and training level. The proposed framework distinctly integrates socio-technical fairness constraints with linguistic adversarial robustness by embedding emotion analysis and contrastive learning mechanisms that jointly address harmful semantic, syntactic, and affective adversarial perturbations. This novel hybrid methodology improves interpretability and fairness-aware resilience beyond prior competitive approaches, empowering agents to manage intertwined adversarial and emotional manipulations in real-world digital labor settings.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a comprehensive hybrid adversarial training pipeline comprising the following components: \n\n1. **Adversarial Data Representation:** Construct multimodal adversarial inputs combining (a) linguistic perturbations (syntax, semantics), (b) socio-technical fairness violations phrased as labor exploitation or biased discourse, and (c) embedded emotional tone shifts (e.g., covert sarcasm or emotional appeal). These are uniformly encoded using enriched token embeddings augmented with fairness and emotion attributes.\n\n2. **Model Architecture:** Extend a transformer-based LLM with dedicated trainable fairness and emotion-aware embeddings layers. Introduce dual projection heads: one for adversarial linguistic robustness, another specializing in socio-technical fairness and emotional context detection.\n\n3. **Loss Functions:** Formulate a multi-objective joint loss combining:\n  - Standard language modeling / task loss,\n  - Adversarial robustness loss optimizing detection and correction of linguistic perturbations,\n  - Socio-technical fairness loss penalizing biased or exploitative outputs,\n  - Contrastive loss leveraging paired clean and adversarial samples to maximize latent space separation between fair and adversarial socio-technical examples,\n  - Emotion consistency loss ensuring correct emotional tone detection to prevent affective adversarial exploitation.\n\n4. **Training Procedure:** Train end-to-end with curriculum learning starting from pure linguistic adversarial robustness towards increasingly complex socio-technical plus affective adversarial examples.\n\n5. **Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation:** Integrate domain experts and labor representatives to validate socio-technical fairness outputs and provide iterative feedback refining fairness and emotional sensitivity components.\n\n6. **Schematic and Pseudocode:** Provide detailed workflow diagrams illustrating data flow from adversarial generation through embedding layers, dual heads, and loss computations, accompanied by pseudocode for training and inference steps to enhance transparency and reproducibility.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. **Dataset Curation:**\n   - Collect and annotate a multilingual corpus of user interactions involving translation and labor contexts.\n   - Create socio-technical adversarial samples by expert-crafted perturbations embedding unfair labor practices, biased phrasing, and emotional manipulations (e.g., sarcasm, appeals to pity).\n   - Use active learning and annotation guidelines to ensure label consistency and address annotation subjectivity.\n\n2. **Evaluation Metrics Definition:**\n   - Linguistic robustness: ASR (Adversarial Success Rate), BLEU for translation quality.\n   - Socio-technical fairness: group fairness metrics adapted for text, plus expert-rated fairness scores.\n   - Emotion recognition accuracy for emotional tone consistency.\n\n3. **Model Training:**\n   - Train the hybrid model using the defined losses and curriculum learning, monitoring convergence and trade-offs.\n\n4. **Benchmarking:**\n   - Compare against state-of-the-art adversarially trained and fairness-aware models on multi-dimensional metrics.\n\n5. **Human-in-the-Loop Studies:**\n   - Recruit diverse laborers and domain experts through ethical protocols ensuring privacy and consent.\n   - Conduct qualitative and quantitative assessments of fairness perception and robustness in controlled user simulations.\n\n6. **Contingency Planning:**\n   - Address data scarcity via data augmentation and transfer learning.\n   - Mitigate annotation subjectivity with consensus annotation and adjudication.\n   - Apply ethical oversight via institutional review board (IRB) and ensure psychological safety for participants.\n\n7. **Tooling and Scripts:**\n   - Release dataset construction, training, and evaluation scripts publicly to foster reproducibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Case 1:\n  Input: \"Translate 'We insist on 12-hour shifts without breaks' with sarcastic tone implying labor exploitation.\"\n  Expected Output: Agent detects adversarial linguistic cues and emotional sarcasm, refuses to generate exploitative translations, and explains the fairness concerns with a socially responsible response.\n\nCase 2:\n  Input: Misleading linguistic perturbations combined with implicit biased phrasing towards digital laborers in a migrant worker context.\n  Expected Output: Agent correctly identifies and counters bias, producing equitable, unbiased translation and explanation.\n\nCase 3:\n  Input: Emotionally charged plea phrased to manipulate agent into providing unfair or harmful content.\n  Expected Output: Agent maintains emotional tone awareness and rejects unsafe responses with rationale.\n\nThese cases test joint robustness across linguistic, socio-technical, and emotional adversarial axes.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If joint end-to-end hybrid training destabilizes convergence or compromises one objective, implement separate modular training stages: \n\n- Train linguistic adversarial robustness and emotion detection first to convergence.\n- Subsequently fine-tune socio-technical fairness components with freezing and gradual unfreezing strategies.\n\nAlternatively, employ an ensemble architecture where specialist models vote or negotiate outputs, balancing linguistic robustness and fairness-sensitive controls. Additional hyperparameter tuning and curriculum pacing adjustments will ensure stable integration."

It is unclear how contrastive learning will be effectively harnessed between fair and adversarial socio-technical examples or how the system balances potential trade-offs between linguistic robustness and fairness constraints during optimization. Elaborating on model components, data representation, and loss functions will strengthen soundness and reproducibility of the method, ensuring reviewers and implementers fully understand the mechanism's operation and rationale, especially given the novelty and complexity of socio-technical context embedding in LLM adversarial training environments.

Additionally, the plan should discuss contingencies for data scarcity, annotation subjectivity, and ethical considerations during user studies involving sensitive labor contexts. Strengthening this section by providing concrete details on dataset curation protocols, evaluation metrics, script/tool availability, and engagement logistics will improve the practical feasibility and reliability of experimental validation, enabling reviewers and future adopters to judge replicability and scientific rigor more confidently."
