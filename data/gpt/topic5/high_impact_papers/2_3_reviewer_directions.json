    "title": "Hybrid Socio-Technical Adversarial Training Framework for Agent Robustness",
    "Problem_Statement": "Traditional adversarial training methods for LLMs in autonomous agents lack socio-technical context embedding, limiting robustness in real-world user-interactions, especially where online translation and digital labour fairness intersect.",
    "Motivation": "Recognizes and fills the critical internal gap by synthesizing socio-technical fairness constraints with adversarial robustness training, producing agents robust not only to linguistic perturbations but also to socio-economic adversarial manipulations embedded in language.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid adversarial training pipeline that: (1) Generates adversarial examples blending linguistic manipulations and socio-technical fairness violations (e.g., unfair labor practices phrasing); (2) Trains agents to detect and correctly handle such multi-dimensional adversarial inputs reconstructing fair, equitable responses; (3) Employs contrastive learning between fair and adversarial socio-technical example sets; (4) Incorporates human-in-the-loop evaluation with laborers and domain experts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct adversarial benchmark datasets combining linguistic and socio-technical adversarial samples. 2) Train LLM agents with hybrid adversarial objectives. 3) Benchmark against standard adversarial training baselines measuring robustness, fairness, and translation quality metrics. 4) Conduct user studies with diverse workers and customers assessing fairness perception and robustness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Adversarial user input mixing misleading translation with language implying labor exploitation. Expected Output: Agent identifies adversarial cues, denies generating unfair content or biased translations, outputs socially responsible and fair response with explanation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If hybrid adversarial training harms model convergence, separate training phases with gradual integration or ensemble model architectures balancing fairness and robustness could be employed."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed hybrid adversarial training mechanism blending linguistic manipulations with socio-technical fairness violations lacks detailed clarity on how these distinct objectives are integrated within the model architecture and training loss. It is unclear how contrastive learning will be effectively harnessed between fair and adversarial socio-technical examples or how the system balances potential trade-offs between linguistic robustness and fairness constraints during optimization. Elaborating on model components, data representation, and loss functions will strengthen soundness and reproducibility of the method, ensuring reviewers and implementers fully understand the mechanism's operation and rationale, especially given the novelty and complexity of socio-technical context embedding in LLM adversarial training environments. Provide schematics or pseudocode illustrating the hybrid pipeline and training integration steps for enhanced transparency and rigor in the Proposed_Method section to solidify internal validity and feasibility of the approach."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The outlined Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan describes important components (dataset construction, training, benchmarking, user studies) but does not address critical feasibility issues such as sourcing or creating validated socio-technical adversarial samples, securing participation from diverse laborers and domain experts for the human-in-the-loop phase, or concretely defining metrics for socio-technical fairness and robustness beyond standard adversarial benchmarks. Additionally, the plan should discuss contingencies for data scarcity, annotation subjectivity, and ethical considerations during user studies involving sensitive labor contexts. Strengthening this section by providing concrete details on dataset curation protocols, evaluation metrics, script/tool availability, and engagement logistics will improve the practical feasibility and reliability of experimental validation, enabling reviewers and future adopters to judge replicability and scientific rigor more confidently."
