Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs), whether virtually or physically embodied, are autonomous agents that are able to perceive an environment including people or other agents, reason, decide how to interact, and express attitudes such as emotions, engagement, or empathy. They are capable of interacting with people and one another in a socially intelligent manner using multimodal communicative behaviors, with the goal to support humans in various domains. Written by international experts in their respective fields, the book summarizes research in the many important research communities pertinent for SIAs, while discussing current challenges and future directions. The handbook provides easy access to modeling and studying SIAs for researchers and students, and aims at further bridging the gap between the research communities involved. In two volumes, the book clearly structures the vast body of research. The first volume starts by introducing what is involved in SIAs research, in particular research methodologies and ethical implications of developing SIAs. It further examines research on appearance and behavior, focusing on multimodality. Finally, social cognition for SIAs is investigated using different theoretical models and phenomena such as theory of mind or pro-sociality. The second volume starts with perspectives on interaction, examined from different angles such as interaction in social space, group interaction, or long-term interaction. It also includes an extensive overview summarizing research and systems of human–agent platforms and of some of the major application areas of SIAs such as education, aging support, autism, and games.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Smart city dvelopment with digital twin technology', 'abstract': 'The Bled eConference, organized by the University of Maribor, Faculty of Organizational Sciences, has been shaping electronic interactions since 1988.

The theme of this year’s 33rd conference is “Enabling Technology for a Sustainable Society”. In the context of the digital society, the implementation of digital technologies to achieve higher efficiency and competitive advantage is insufficient. Society calls for different economy models which need to be more responsible, righteous and less exploitative to achieve wellbeing of all and sustainable development of society.

    "title": "Enhancing Robustness and Recovery from Adversarial Failures in Large Language Models for Autonomous Customer Service Agents: Research Landscape Map",
    "current_research_landscape": "The research landscape centers on improving the effectiveness and reliability of language technologies within autonomous customer service agents. The core problem cluster, illuminated by the central concepts, revolves around translation technology (including online translation, machine translation, translator training, and translation memory) and their interaction with digital society aspects such as digital labour and socially interactive agents (e.g., intelligent virtual agents). The thematic islands identify key focus areas: computational linguistics and language translation technologies, the societal impact and governance of digital systems, public administration and policy frameworks, and development of socially interactive agents capable of sophisticated human-like interaction. Foundational works emphasize multidisciplinary methods combining computational linguistic models, AI-driven language processing, social and governance perspectives, and embodied conversational agents to realize intelligent, context-aware user interactions. Dominant paradigms include machine learning-centered translation and interactive agent architectures, integration of socio-technical systems theory from digital society research, and human-centered design methods from public administration and social robotics fields.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps emerge from the absence of bridge nodes connecting these thematic islands, indicating a lack of integrated frameworks that unify translation technology advances with socially interactive agent behaviors and public policy considerations. While foundational literature underscores the importance of translation quality and interactive capabilities, limitations include insufficient robustness of LLMs against adversarial inputs and little exploration of recovery mechanisms post-failure in autonomous agents. The apparent siloing limits holistic solutions addressing both technical and social dimensions. Externally, the GPS 'hidden bridges' reveal novel, cross-disciplinary opportunities overlooked locally. Notably, connections between 'online translation' and 'digital labour' spotlight challenges related to gig work dynamics and fairness in platform-mediated language services—points that can inform resilient system designs safeguarding human-AI interaction reliability. Further, linking 'online translation' with 'socially interactive agents' addresses ethical competence and social responsibility aspects critical for autonomous agents operating in sensitive customer service roles. Another latent avenue combines 'field of public administration' with 'socially interactive agents' to integrate governance frameworks and compliance considerations directly into agent behavior models, enhancing trust and accountability. These hidden bridges suggest that embedding socially and policy-aware contextual modules into LLM-driven agents could robustly mitigate failure impacts and improve recovery by aligning agent actions with broader societal and labor standards.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate insights from the 'online translation' and 'digital labour' intersection to develop adversarial robustness mechanisms in translation components of autonomous agents that account for fairness and transparency in human-AI work collaborations. This addresses the local limitation of robustness by embedding socio-technical fairness protocols directly into translation memory and model update processes.\n\nOpportunity 2: Fuse 'online translation' with 'socially interactive agents' by incorporating ethical competence and social responsibility models into LLMs driving conversational behavior, enabling autonomous agents not only to resist adversarial failures but also to recover by socially appropriate reparative interactions, enhancing user trust.\n\nOpportunity 3: Leverage the link between 'field of public administration' and 'socially interactive agents' to design compliance-aware autonomous customer service agents that dynamically adapt responses aligning with public policy and governance standards, thereby mitigating adversarial risks emerging from regulatory or ethical misalignments and supporting systematic recovery protocols governed by institutional frameworks."
