The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Handbook of Interview Research', 'abstract': 'The Handbook offers a comprehensive examination of the interview at the cutting edge of information technology. Drawing upon leading experts from a wide range of professional disciplines, this book addresses conceptual and technical challenges that confront both academic researchers and interviewers with more applied goals. From interview theory to the nuts-and-bolts of the interview process, the coverage is impressively broad and authoritative.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'The SAGE Encyclopedia of Communication Research Methods', 'abstract': 'Communication research is evolving and changing in a world of online journals, open-access, and new ways of obtaining data and conducting experiments via the Internet. Although there are generic encyclopedias describing basic social science research methodologies in general, until now there has been no comprehensive A-to-Z reference work exploring methods specific to communication and media studies. Our entries, authored by key figures in the field, focus on special considerations when applied specifically to communication research, accompanied by engaging examples from the literature of communication, journalism, and media studies. Entries cover every step of the research process, from the creative development of research topics and questions to literature reviews, selection of best methods (whether quantitative, qualitative, or mixed) for analyzing research results and publishing research findings, whether in traditional media or via new media outlets. In addition to expected entries covering the basics of theories and methods traditionally used in communication research, other entries discuss important trends influencing the future of that research, including contemporary practical issues students will face in communication professions, the influences of globalization on research, use of new recording technologies in fieldwork, and the challenges and opportunities related to studying online multi-media environments. Email, texting, cellphone video, and blogging are shown not only as topics of research but also as means of collecting and analyzing data.

It is a comprehensive review of theorizing and empirical research that can serve as a reference and starting point for additional research on the theory. It can be used as a supplementary textbook in an intense course on leadership--or as a primary text in a course or seminar focusing on transformational leadership.New in the Second Edition:*New, updated examples of leadership have been included to help illustrate the concepts, as well as show the broad range of transformational leadership in a variety of settings.*New chapters have been added focusing specifically on the measurement of transformational leadership and transformational leadership and effectiveness.*The discussion of both predicators and effects of transformational leadership is greatly expanded.*Much more emphasis is given to authentic vs. inauthentic transformational leadership.*Suggestions are made for guiding the future of research and applications of transformational leadership.*A greatly expanded reference list is included.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Managing the Risks of Organizational Accidents', 'abstract': 'Major accidents are rare events due to the many barriers, safeguards and defences developed by modern technologies. But they continue to happen with saddening regularity and their human and financial consequences are all too often unacceptably catastrophic. One of the greatest challenges we face is to develop more effective ways of both understanding and limiting their occurrence. This lucid book presents a set of common principles to further our knowledge of the causes of major accidents in a wide variety of high-technology systems. It also describes tools and techniques for managing the risks of such organizational accidents that go beyond those currently available to system managers and safety professionals. James Reason deals comprehensively with the prevention of major accidents arising from human and organizational causes. He argues that the same general principles and management techniques are appropriate for many different domains. These include banks and insurance companies just as much as nuclear power plants, oil exploration and production companies, chemical process installations and air, sea and rail transport. Its unique combination of principles and practicalities make this seminal book essential reading for all whose daily business is to manage, audit and regulate hazardous technologies of all kinds. It is relevant to those concerned with understanding and controlling human and organizational factors and will also interest academic readers and those working in industrial and government agencies.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Handbook of Research Methods in Health Social Sciences', 'abstract': 'Research is defined by the Australian Research Council as “the creation of new knowledge and/or the use of existing knowledge in a new and creative way so as to generate new concepts, methodologies, inventions and understandings”. Research is thus the foundation for knowledge. It produces evidence and informs actions that can provide wider benefit to a society. The knowledge that researchers cultivate from a piece of research can be adopted for social and health programs that can improve the health and well-being of the individuals, their communities and the societies in which they live. As we have witnessed in all corners of the globe, research has become an endeavor that most of us in the health and social sciences cannot avoid. This Handbook is conceived to provide the foundation to readers who wish to embark on a research project in order to form knowledge that they need. The Handbook comprises four main sections: Traditional research methods sciences; Innovative research methods; Doing cross-cultural research; and Sensitive research methodology and approach. This Handbook attests to the diversity and richness of research methods in the health and social sciences. It will benefit many readers, particularly students and researchers who undertake research in health and social science areas. It is also valuable for the training needs of postgraduate students who wish to undertake research in cross-cultural settings, with special groups of people, as it provides essential knowledge not only on the methods of data collection but also salient issues that they need to know if they wish to succeed in their research endeavors.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'The SAGE Encyclopedia of Educational Research, Measurement, and Evaluation', 'abstract': 'In an era of curricular changes and experiments and high-stakes testing, educational measurement and evaluation is more important than ever.

The uncertainty that surrounds the future is both exciting and challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise risks and maximise utilities. The large number of forecasting applications calls for a diverse set of forecasting methods to tackle real-life challenges. This article provides a non-systematic review of the theory and the practice of forecasting. We provide an overview of a wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles, and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety of real-life contexts. We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and applications. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of forecasting theory and practice. Given its encyclopedic nature, the intended mode of reading is non-linear. We offer cross-references to allow the readers to navigate through the various topics. We complement the theoretical concepts and applications covered by large lists of free or open-source software implementations and publicly-available databases.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Handbook of Uncertainty Quantification', 'abstract': 'The topic of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) has witnessed massive developments in response to the promise of achieving risk mitigation through scientific prediction. It has led to the integration of ideas from mathematics, statistics and engineering being used to lend credence to predictive assessments of risk but also to design actions (by engineers, scientists and investors) that are consistent with risk aversion. The objective of this Handbook is to facilitate the dissemination of the forefront of UQ ideas to their audiences. We recognize that these audiences are varied, with interests ranging from theory to application, and from research to development and even execution.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'The Science of Citizen Science', 'abstract': 'This open access book discusses how the involvement of citizens into scientific endeavors is expected to contribute to solve the big challenges of our time, such as climate change and the loss of biodiversity, growing inequalities within and between societies, and the sustainability turn. The field of citizen science has been growing in recent decades. Many different stakeholders from scientists to citizens and from policy makers to environmental organisations have been involved in its practice. In addition, many scientists also study citizen science as a research approach and as a way for science and society to interact and collaborate. This book provides a representation of the practices as well as scientific and societal outcomes in different disciplines. It reflects the contribution of citizen science to societal development, education, or innovation and provides and overview of the field of actors as well as on tools and guidelines. It serves as an introduction for anyone who wants to get involved in and learn more about the science of citizen science.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

Central nodes highlight focus on communication research, media studies, and the digital transformation of organizations, indicating a multidisciplinary approach to examining how AI-generated content impacts professional disciplines and organizational practices. Dominant methods include qualitative methodologies such as interviewing theory, bibliometric and field analyses within communication studies, alongside conceptual and technical evaluations of information technology applications. The thematic islands suggest sub-themes around communication frameworks, the technical challenges of AI integration, and organizational transformation induced by digital innovations. The foundational papers emphasize the dual nature of generative AI: opportunities for enhanced productivity and efficiency versus risks like bias, misinformation, ethical/legal challenges, and transparency concerns. This duality is central to the problem: how to harness AI capabilities while mitigating hallucination and misinformation, particularly in high-stakes sectors like financial advisory systems.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps include a lack of robust methodologies for assessing and ensuring the accuracy and transparency of AI-generated content amidst organizational digital transformation; specifically, despite recognition of biases and misinformation risks, the literature lacks standardized frameworks for real-time verification and reliable risk management within complex organizational structures. The bridge nodes connecting communication research and media studies to information technology highlight a missing integration: while communication theories address dissemination and interpretation, their fusion with technical safeguards against misinformation in AI outputs is underdeveloped. Externally, the global context reveals underexploited opportunities in combining information technology with organizational transformation and communication research—particularly in risk quantification, cybersecurity, and real-time information sharing. For example, leveraging concepts from health information systems (e.g., multi-professional real-time collaboration and robust information security protocols) could inform new frameworks to prevent hallucination and misinformation spread in financial AI advisory platforms. Similarly, adopting digital leadership and organizational learning models from psychology and management research offers a novel bridge towards embedding ethical and effective AI governance within financial institutions. This cross-disciplinary nexus is currently absent in the literature, representing a crucial unexplored frontier.",
