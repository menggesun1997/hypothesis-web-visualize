    "title": "Cognitive-AI Co-Mediation Framework for Bias Mitigation in Healthcare LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) in healthcare decision support often produce biased outputs due to data and model limitations, and these biases are poorly understood or communicated to healthcare professionals. There is no effective system that integrates unbiased human expertise and AI outputs through interactive communication to dynamically identify and mitigate such biases.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal and external gaps concerning the lack of integration between AI technological advances and communication, specifically bridging AI development with human-AI teaming frameworks. This novel approach leverages a human-AI co-mediation framework that combines human cognitive judgment with LLM outputs in a communicative loop to detect and mitigate bias dynamically.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an interactive AI system where healthcare professionals collaborate with an LLM through a structured dialogue interface. The system includes a bias detector module trained on known bias patterns, but critically, incorporates human-in-the-loop corrections that adapt model outputs via reinforcement learning from human feedback. Complementing this, an explanation communication layer translates model uncertainty and bias risk into intuitive visualizations and natural language alerts grounded in risk communication theories to enhance stakeholder understanding.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate a healthcare decision datasets with annotated bias instances (e.g., racial, gender bias).\n2. Build initial LLM models and train bias detectors.\n3. Develop the interactive communication interface embedding risk communication elements.\n4. Implement human-in-the-loop learning to dynamically update bias mitigation.\n5. Evaluate on real-world healthcare cases measuring bias reduction, user trust (via surveys), and decision accuracy compared to static LLM baselines.\n6. Conduct ablation studies to analyze contributions of communication interface and human feedback modules.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient description including minority ethnicity and symptoms.\nLLM output (biased): Treatment plan ignoring minority-specific complications.\nAfter human-AI co-mediation: System flags potential bias, provides explanation, healthcare professional iteratively adjusts plan with AI support resulting in a tailored, equitable treatment recommendation.\nExpected output: Transparent, bias-mitigated recommendation with documented rationale.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If human-in-the-loop adjustments are insufficient, investigate alternative bias detectors with multimodal inputs (e.g., medical images). If communication interface is ineffective, incorporate personalized user profiling to tailor message complexity and modality."

          "feedback_content": "While the step-by-step experiment plan is thorough in terms of system building and evaluation, it lacks detail on how biases will be quantitatively measured and validated beyond user trust and decision accuracy. To ensure feasibility and rigorous validation, specify concrete bias metrics (e.g., disparity indices, fairness metrics) and statistical testing protocols. Additionally, clarify the scale and diversity of healthcare datasets to confirm representativeness for bias types targeted. This will strengthen the scientific soundness and replicability of the evaluation framework, a critical aspect for deployment in sensitive healthcare settings involving human-AI co-mediation loops with reinforcement learning components, where uncontrolled feedback loops can introduce risks or instabilities otherwise overlooked in the plan's current form. Finally, more details on managing and scheduling human-in-the-loop interventions and how reinforcement learning updates interface with model stability would enhance feasibility confidence for this complex system. Targeted pilot studies exploring interaction patterns could precede full scale experiments to mitigate these risks early on, which should be incorporated explicitly in the plan to improve feasibility and credibility in real-world healthcare AI applications.

          "feedback_content": "Given the preliminary novelty verdict as NOV-COMPETITIVE, and the well-known competitive research on bias mitigation in healthcare LLMs, to bolster the impact and differentiation, integrate concepts from the Globally-Linked Concepts such as 'cognitive security,' 'Responsible AI,' and 'human-computer interaction theory.' For example, explicitly embedding cognitive security principles could provide a novel angle safeguarding against adversarial or unintended model biases, while tailoring the explanation communication layer through adaptive instructional systems could enhance human cognitive engagement and trust. Harnessing frameworks from Responsible AI to systematically audit and report biases within this co-mediation loop could raise the framework's broader societal relevance and acceptance. Finally, grounding the interface and human-AI teaming design in established human-computer interaction theories can improve usability and foster adoption by healthcare professionals, potentially increasing impact and novelty beyond current state-of-the-art approaches. Emphasize these cross-disciplinary integrations in the proposal to strengthen global relevance and provide a clearer path for practical deployment and future extension.
