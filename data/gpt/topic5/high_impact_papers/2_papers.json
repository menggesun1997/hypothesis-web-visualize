    "abstract": "This SAGE Handbook brings together cutting edge social scientific research and theoretical insight into the emerging contours of digital society. Chapters explore the relationship between digitisation, social organisation and social transformation at both the macro and micro level, making this a valuable resource for postgraduate students and academics conducting research across the social sciences. The topics covered are impressively far-ranging and timely, including machine learning, social media, surveillance, misinformation, digital labour, and beyond. This innovative Handbook perfectly captures the state of the art of a field which is rapidly gaining cross-disciplinary interest and global importance, and establishes a thematic framework for future teaching and research. Part 1: Theorising Digital Societies; Part 2: Researching Digital Societies; Part 3: Sociotechnical Systems and Disruptive Technologies in Action; Part 4: Digital Society and New Social Dilemmas; Part 5: Governance and Regulation; and Part 6: Digital Futures.",

    "abstract": "Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Technology, second edition, provides a state-of-the-art survey of the field of computer-assisted translation. It is the first definitive reference to provide a comprehensive overview of the general, regional, and topical aspects of this increasingly significant area of study. The Encyclopedia is divided into three parts: Part 1 presents general issues in translation technology, such as its history and development, translator training, and various aspects of machine translation, including a valuable case study of its teaching at a major university; Part 2 discusses national and regional developments in translation technology, offering contributions covering the crucial territories of China, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Japan, South Africa, Taiwan, the Netherlands and Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the United States; Part 3 evaluates specific matters in translation technology, with entries focused on subjects such as alignment, concordancing, localization, online translation, and translation memory. The new edition has five additional chapters, with many chapters updated and revised, drawing on the expertise of over 50 contributors from around the world and an international panel of consultant editors to provide a selection of chapters on the most pertinent topics in the discipline. All the chapters are self-contained, extensively cross-referenced, and include useful and up-to-date references and information for further reading. Part 1 presents general issues in translation technology, such as its history and development, translator training, and various aspects of machine translation, including a valuable case study of its teaching at a major university; Part 2 discusses national and regional developments in translation technology, offering contributions covering the crucial territories of China, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Japan, South Africa, Taiwan, the Netherlands and Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the United States; Part 3 evaluates specific matters in translation technology, with entries focused on subjects such as alignment, concordancing, localization, online translation, and translation memory. It will be an invaluable reference work for anyone with a professional or academic interest in the subject.",

    "abstract": "The Handbook on Socially Interactive Agents provides a comprehensive overview of the research fields of Embodied Conversational Agents, Intelligent Virtual Agents, and Social Robotics. Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs), whether virtually or physically embodied, are autonomous agents that are able to perceive an environment including people or other agents, reason, decide how to interact, and express attitudes such as emotions, engagement, or empathy. They are capable of interacting with people and one another in a socially intelligent manner using multimodal communicative behaviors, with the goal to support humans in various domains. Written by international experts in their respective fields, the book summarizes research in the many important research communities pertinent for SIAs, while discussing current challenges and future directions. The handbook provides easy access to modeling and studying SIAs for researchers and students, and aims at further bridging the gap between the research communities involved. In two volumes, the book clearly structures the vast body of research. The first volume starts by introducing what is involved in SIAs research, in particular research methodologies and ethical implications of developing SIAs. It further examines research on appearance and behavior, focusing on multimodality. Finally, social cognition for SIAs is investigated using different theoretical models and phenomena such as theory of mind or pro-sociality. The second volume starts with perspectives on interaction, examined from different angles such as interaction in social space, group interaction, or long-term interaction. It also includes an extensive overview summarizing research and systems of human–agent platforms and of some of the major application areas of SIAs such as education, aging support, autism, and games.",

    "abstract": "The Bled eConference, organized by the University of Maribor, Faculty of Organizational Sciences, has been shaping electronic interactions since 1988. The Bled eConference is the oldest, most traditional and well renowned conference in the field with a tradition of more than 30 years. In 2020, for the first time in history, Bled eConference was held online due to COVID-19 pandemic. The role of digital technologies has never been as important as in this time, enabling people to interact and work from home during quarantine. The theme of this year’s 33rd conference is “Enabling Technology for a Sustainable Society”. In the context of the digital society, the implementation of digital technologies to achieve higher efficiency and competitive advantage is insufficient. Society calls for different economy models which need to be more responsible, righteous and less exploitative to achieve wellbeing of all and sustainable development of society. Digital technologies have an important role to achieve these goals.  In this year’s conference, we address various aspects of digital transformation opportunities and challenges. We provide directions and guidelines for organizations to meet and overcome these challenges on their way towards designing sustainable business models. Themes covered in the papers of these proceedings are focused on: business model innovation; big data, data science; e-health, digital wellness; new applications and organizational models; and novel approaches and cases for education in the digital economy.",

    "abstract": "Driving 5G Mobile Communications with Artificial Intelligence towards 6G presents current work and directions of continuous innovation and development in multimedia communications with a focus on services and users. The fifth generation of mobile wireless networks achieved the first deployment by 2020, completed the first phase of evolution in 2022, and started transition phase of 5G-Advanced toward the sixth generation. Perhaps one of the most important innovations brought by 5G is the platform approach to connectivity, i.e., a single standard that can adapt to the heterogeneous connectivity requirements of vastly different use cases. 5G networks contain a list of different requirements, standardized technical specifications, and a range of implementation options with spectral efficiency, latency, and reliability as primary performance metrics. Toward 6G, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods have recently proposed new approaches to modeling, designing, optimizing, and implementing systems. They are now mature technologies that improve many research fields significantly. The area of wireless multimedia communications has developed immensely, generating a large number of concepts, ideas, technical specifications, mobile standards, patents, and articles. Identifying the basic ideas and their complex interconnections becomes increasingly important. The book is divided into three major parts, with each part containing four to five chapters: Advanced 5G communication Machine learning-based communication and network automation Artificial intelligence towards 6G Advanced 5G communication Machine learning-based communication and network automation Artificial intelligence towards 6G The first part discusses three main scenarios and standard specification of 5G use cases (eMBB, URLLC, mMTC), vehicular systems beyond 5G, and efficient edge architecture on NFV infrastructure. In the second part, different AI/ML-based methodologies and open research challenges are presented in introducing 5G-AIoT artificial intelligence of things, scheduling in 5G/6G communication systems, application of DL techniques to modulation, detection, and channel coding as well as 5G open source tools for experimentation and testing. The third part paves the way to deploy scenarios for different innovative services including technologies and applications of 5G/6G intelligent connectivity, AI-assisted eXtended Reality, integrated 5G-IoT architecture in next-generation Smart Grid, privacy requirements in a hyper- connected world, and evaluation of representative 6G use cases and technology trends. The book is written by field experts from Europe and Mauritius who introduce a blend of scientific and engineering concepts covering this emerging wireless communication area. It is a very good reference book for telecom professionals, engineers, and practitioners in various 5G vertical domains and, finally, a basis for student courses in 5G/6G wireless systems.",

    "abstract": "This book presents the latest cutting edge research, theoretical methods, and novel applications in the field of computational intelligence and computational biological approaches that are aiming to combat COVID-19. The book gives the technological key drivers behind using AI to find drugs that target the virus, shedding light on the structure of COVID-19, detecting the outbreak and spread of new diseases, spotting signs of a COVID-19 infection in medical images, monitoring how the virus and lockdown is affecting mental health, and forecasting how COVID-19 cases and deaths will spread across cities and why. Further, the book helps readers understand computational intelligence techniques combating COVID-19 in a simple and systematic way. Provides a comprehensive reference covering innovations and development of theories, conceptual models and computational algorithms focused on COVID-19; Asserts all relevant research, key themes, complex adaptive systems, metrics and paradigms dedicated towards COVID-19, enabled with evolutionary methods of computational sciences; Explores how AI and computational techniques can help to predict which patients with the virus would go on to develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).",
