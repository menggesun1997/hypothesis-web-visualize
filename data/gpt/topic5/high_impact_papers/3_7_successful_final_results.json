    "Problem_Statement": "In multimodal scientific data mining (text, images, tables), current language models lack real-time adaptive recovery mechanisms to maintain performance under computational resource fluctuations, increasing environmental cost.",

        "title": "Real-Time Recovery via Multi-Agent Supervisory Control in Multi-Modal Scientific Data Fusion",
        "Problem_Statement": "In multimodal scientific data mining involving text, images, and tables, existing language models lack adaptive, scalable, and robust real-time recovery mechanisms that effectively respond to computational resource fluctuations and modality-specific challenges, which leads to degradation in inference quality and increased environmental costs.",
        "Motivation": "While supervisory control has been explored in robotics and scientific literature mining, current approaches insufficiently address scalability, modularity, and cross-modality coordination required for real-time recovery in multi-modal systems. By re-conceptualizing supervisory control as a collaborative multi-agent system, inspired by research in multi-robot systems and self-adaptive software, this proposal aims to create an innovative, scalable framework that dynamically manages modality-specific monitoring and recovery actions across distributed computational resources. This advancement not only extends adaptive recovery beyond static, single-agent control but also addresses broader software robustness and adaptability challenges, significantly enhancing novelty and impact.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-agent supervisory control architecture where each agent specializes in monitoring and managing a specific modality (e.g., text, image, table) and the associated computational resources. Agents continuously monitor fine-grained control signals such as modality-specific inference confidence scores, resource utilizations (CPU, GPU load, memory bandwidth), and latency metrics. Each agent maintains a local state representation and communicates with a centralized coordinator agent implementing an agent-oriented software engineering pattern. Recovery triggers include thresholds on modality degradation metrics and resource saturation signals. Recovery actions are detailed as: modality switching (e.g., delegating processing to a lighter model variant), selective attention recalibration (adjusting attention weights within the modality’s encoder), and dynamic re-encoding with compressed representations. Reinforcement learning policies are trained per agent under constraints from adaptive control theory to optimize energy-performance trade-offs, with reward signals combining task accuracy, latency, and energy consumption. The multi-agent setup enables decentralized decision-making with collaborative coordination, facilitating robustness and scalability akin to heterogeneous multi-robot systems. Diagrams and pseudocode will be provided to clearly illustrate inter-agent communication protocols, control loop mechanisms, and policy integration within multimodal architectures, ensuring reproducibility and early validation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate comprehensive multi-modal scientific datasets (text, images, tables) with ground truth for performance evaluation.\n2. Develop modular baseline multi-modal language model components supporting dynamic control interfaces per modality.\n3. Architect and implement the multi-agent supervisory control framework, including agent roles, centralized coordinator, and communication bus.\n4. Define precise control signals and recovery triggers per modality agent; design recovery actions with configurable parameters.\n5. Train and fine-tune agent-specific RL policies with adaptive control constraints using simulated hardware fluctuations.\n6. Evaluate overall system robustness, resource usage, recovery latency, and inference quality under varying real and simulated hardware constraint scenarios.\n7. Perform comprehensive ablation studies comparing single-agent versus multi-agent supervisory control and RL versus rule-based policies.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multi-modal data describing complex experimental setups with fluctuating GPU load.\nExpected Output: The image modality agent detects a GPU overload via monitoring utilization and inference confidence drop, then triggers an attention recalibration reducing image encoder complexity. Concurrently, the text modality agent maintains full attention. The coordinated multi-agent system collectively maintains >90% F1 score on information extraction tasks while reducing energy spikes by 30% and recovery latency below 200ms.\n\nAdditional Case: During heterogeneous resource saturation, agent-level RL policies dynamically delegate encoding to lighter model variants or reallocate attention, showing graceful degradation and robust multimodal inference continuity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If RL policy training encounters instability or scalability bottlenecks, fallback to hybrid approaches combining rule-based triggers derived from observed patterns and offline policy learning from collected logs. Additionally, modular design allows isolated agent improvements or replacement, and heuristic ensemble decision-making at the coordinator level can be explored as an alternative to fully RL-driven control, ensuring robustness and progressive enhancement without compromising core system functionality."
