    "title": "Compliance-Aware Autonomous Service Agents with Dynamic Policy Adaptation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Autonomous customer service agents lack mechanisms to dynamically align their responses with evolving public policies and governance standards, increasing adversarial risk and legal exposure.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap by merging 'public administration' and 'socially interactive agents' to embed compliance and governance into response generation. This dynamically contextualizes agent behavior in regulatory frameworks, a paradigm shift from static or manual compliance updates.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a policy-aware agent architecture with: (1) A structured policy knowledge base periodically updated with new regulations and public governance directives; (2) A compliance reasoning module that evaluates candidate responses for regulatory alignment pre-deployment; (3) A feedback loop that ingests compliance audit results and adjusts agent behavior models through reinforcement learning; (4) An explainability interface providing compliance rationale to users and regulators.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect public policy and regulatory documents relevant to customer service. 2) Build a formalized policy knowledge ontology. 3) Integrate compliance reasoning into an LLM customer service framework (e.g., GPT-based). 4) Test on adversarial scenarios aimed at exploiting policy gaps. 5) Evaluate using standard NLP metrics plus compliance adherence rates, user trust, and regulatory audit simulation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User requests service that borders regulation (e.g., data privacy query). Expected Output: Agent provides response compliant with the latest regulation, with a rationale statement indicating policy grounding. If adversarial input aims to elicit non-compliant response, agent detects and rejects or redirects appropriately.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If automatic policy reasoning is brittle, fallback to flagging uncertain responses for human review coupled with adaptive learning from human corrections. Alternatively, incorporate rule-based overrides for critical regulations."
