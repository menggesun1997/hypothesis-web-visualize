    "title": "Adaptive AI Governance Model Embedding Digital Leadership for Ethical Financial Advisory LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Financial institutions incorporating large language models into advisory roles lack adaptive governance frameworks that continuously assess risk, enforce ethics, and mitigate biases as organizational digital transformation unfolds.",
    "Motivation": "Directly responds to the external gap of absent fusion between organizational learning capacity, digital leadership models from psychology/management, and AI governance in finance, proposing a novel interdisciplinary governance architecture.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive AI governance framework embedding digital leadership constructs by: (1) modeling digital leadership behaviors and organizational learning cycles as computational entities; (2) implementing a continuous risk assessment engine for AI outputs using organizational feedback loops and real-time monitoring; (3) incorporating ethical oversight protocols that dynamically evolve under organizational transformation stimuli. The framework incorporates psychological models to simulate and predict governance efficacy, allowing proactive policy adjustments.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather organizational digital transformation case studies and leadership assessments. 2) Implement simulation environments modeling leadership influence on AI governance decisions. 3) Develop and integrate continuous risk and bias monitoring tools leveraging LLM interpretability advances. 4) Validate with controlled deployments in simulated financial advisory workflows, measuring governance adaptability, ethical incident reduction, and stakeholder satisfaction.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Introduction of a novel AI advisory feature increases hallucination risk. Output: The governance model detects elevated risk, simulates leadership interventions, deploys updated policies to mitigate bias/hallucination, and learns from feedback to refine future governance responses.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If organizational learning cycles prove too complex to model computationally, simplify models focusing on key leadership signals and incorporate human-in-the-loop policy adjustment mechanisms to maintain adaptability."
