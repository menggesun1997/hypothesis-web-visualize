    "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Hallucination Risk Quantification Metric Integrating Communication and Cybersecurity Perspectives",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is no standardized metric quantitatively assessing hallucination risk in AI-generated financial advisory content that incorporates both communication dissemination dynamics and cybersecurity threat modeling.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to the critical internal gap of lacking robust risk quantification frameworks by synthesizing communication research on information spread with cybersecurity risk metrics, establishing a novel hybrid hallucination risk score.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a composite hallucination risk quantification metric combining: (1) communication-derived parameters such as source credibility, message ambiguity, and propagation velocity; (2) cybersecurity threat model components like vulnerability exposure, attack surface related to AI outputs, and mitigation readiness; (3) integration into an interpretable scoring system that can be applied in real-time to each AI-generated advisory message to guide risk-aware delivery.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Review literature to identify key parameters in communication and cybersecurity domains relating to misinformation. 2) Collect annotated AI advisory datasets with hallucination labeling. 3) Define and calibrate metric components using machine learning techniques. 4) Validate metric by comparing system risk scores to actual hallucination incidence and expert assessments. 5) Benchmark against existing hallucination/confidence metrics for interpretability and usefulness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI advisory message flagged with high ambiguity and originating from less monitored AI subprocess, resulting in a high composite risk score. Output: Advisory is delayed for further verification or flagged with transparent warnings to end users, reducing harm potential.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If composite scoring proves too complex for real-time use, develop separate partial metrics for communication and cybersecurity, then combine via heuristic thresholds until full integration is optimized."

        "title": "Interpretable Composite Hallucination Risk Metric with Cross-Domain Adaptability for AI-Generated Advisory Content Integrating Communication, Cybersecurity, and Regulatory Perspectives",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing hallucination risk metrics for AI-generated advisory content lack a standardized, quantitatively rigorous framework that transparently integrates heterogeneous factors from communication dissemination dynamics and cybersecurity threat modeling. Moreover, current approaches narrowly target financial advisories, limiting broader applicability across critical domains such as healthcare and infrastructure protection where misinformation risks have significant safety, legal, and regulatory implications.",
        "Motivation": "This research addresses a critical gap by proposing a novel, interpretable composite hallucination risk metric that systematically unifies key parameters from communication science and cybersecurity within a mathematically sound framework. Emphasizing the integration of regulatory and legal considerations—such as insights from the Artificial Intelligence Act and cyber risk management practices—enhances the metric's relevance and trustworthiness. By explicitly designing for modularity and domain adaptability, the approach transcends financial advisories to empower risk-aware AI deployment across high-stakes sectors, thereby elevating safety, compliance, and stakeholder confidence where AI-generated content could cause harm.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a mathematically explicit, multi-level integration model for hallucination risk quantification consisting of: (1) Parameter identification from communication science (e.g., source credibility score, message ambiguity index, propagation velocity rank) and cybersecurity threat factors (e.g., AI output vulnerability exposure level, attack surface measure, mitigation readiness score) calibrated according to domain-specific impact weights informed by regulatory frameworks like the Artificial Intelligence Act and Digital Services Act; (2) Normalization of heterogeneous parameter scales via min-max scaling and probabilistic transformation to enable comparability; (3) Construction of a hierarchical weighted aggregation model, employing a transparent additive weighting scheme combined with conflict resolution rules based on dominance heuristics and uncertainty margins; (4) Deployment of an interpretable scoring system producing composite hallucination risk scores bounded in [0,1], supporting real-time assessment and enabling actionable interventions; (5) Facilitated modular extension to other domains including connected healthcare and critical infrastructure via adjustable parameter sets and regulatory/legal compliance modules; and (6) Integration of proactive defense strategy principles and cyber risk management best practices to guide metric refinement and practical system deployment. This rigorous methodological design ensures replicability, interpretability, and operational feasibility while positioning the metric as a foundational tool for AI risk governance across multiple high-stakes real-world scenarios.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Conduct comprehensive literature synthesis to identify and quantify key communication and cybersecurity parameters relevant to hallucination risk and misinformation, and analyze regulatory documents (e.g., AI Act, DSA) to capture compliance-driven weighting principles. 2) Compile and annotate diverse AI-generated advisory message datasets across financial, healthcare, and infrastructure domains with hallucination labels and contextual metadata. 3) Formally define and mathematically implement the composite risk metric including normalization, weighting, and conflict resolution mechanisms; perform theoretical validation of properties such as monotonicity and sensitivity. 4) Calibrate model weights and parameters through statistical learning techniques informed by domain-specific risk impact and regulatory priorities. 5) Empirically validate the metric by correlating risk scores with actual hallucination occurrences and expert assessments; perform comparative benchmarking against existing hallucination/confidence metrics regarding interpretability and prediction performance. 6) Test adaptability and modular extension by applying the metric framework to test datasets from healthcare and infrastructure advisories, verifying regulatory alignment and operational feasibility. 7) Incorporate stakeholder feedback from domain experts, regulators, and end users to refine interpretability and usability aspects.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An AI-generated advisory message in the healthcare domain flagged with moderate source credibility, elevated message ambiguity, rapid online propagation, vulnerable AI subprocess involvement, and partial mitigation controls. Output: The composite risk score computes to 0.78 (high risk), triggering real-time deployment of a transparent warning overlay for end users and a throttling protocol delaying message dissemination until expert verification. Additionally, the system logs the advisory with regulatory compliance metadata to aid governance audits across healthcare IoT connected devices.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should the full composite scoring model prove computationally intensive or difficult to deploy in real-time, we will develop modular partial metrics separately assessing communication and cybersecurity risks using scalable heuristics. These partial metrics will be combined through well-defined thresholding rules to approximate the integrated risk score. This staged approach maintains actionable utility while allowing phased improvements toward full interpretability and integration, enabling timely practical adoption and incremental refinement informed by empirical results and evolving regulatory requirements."

          "feedback_content": "While the composite metric proposal combining communication and cybersecurity parameters is a promising interdisciplinary approach, the current description lacks clarity on how these heterogeneous factors will be quantitatively integrated into a unified, interpretable risk score. Specifically, explicit mechanisms or models for weighting, normalization, and conflict resolution among parameters are not delineated, which raises concerns about sound interpretability and validity of the final metric. It is critical to define the mathematical formulation or algorithmic framework that governs this integration to ensure soundness and replicability of the method, as well as to justify why certain parameters are emphasized over others within the scoring system. This clarity will also directly influence feasibility and eventual impact of the metric in operational settings, as interpretability is key for stakeholder trust and adoption. I recommend elaborating a detailed methodological design section that demonstrates this integration process with formal definitions or model architectures, supported by theoretical or empirical rationale, before advancing to calibration or validation stages in the experiment plan. This step will strengthen the scientific rigor of the proposed method substantially in the 'Proposed_Method' section, making it clearer how the metric translates interdisciplinary concepts into quantitative hallucination risk assessment applicable to AI-generated financial advisory content."

          "feedback_code": "IMP-BROADEN_IMPACT",
          "feedback_content": "The current proposal focuses exclusively on AI-generated financial advisory messages, which, while important, limits the broader potential application and impact of the hallucination risk quantification metric. Given that hallucination risks and misinformation propagation are critical issues across many high-stakes domains—such as connected healthcare, critical infrastructure protection, and compliance with emerging AI regulatory frameworks like the Artificial Intelligence Act—expanding the scope to include or at least explicitly plan for adaptation to adjacent domains would significantly increase the relevance and impact of this work. For example, integrating considerations from legal duty frameworks or cyber risk management in safety-critical systems would enhance the metric's practical utility and scalability. I suggest that the authors include in their motivation and experimental plans a discussion on generalizability or modularity of their approach to domains beyond finance-oriented advisory, possibly by leveraging globally linked concepts such as proactive defense strategy, Internet of Medical Things, or digital services regulation. Doing so will strengthen the appeal of the contribution by showing it can influence multiple real-world scenarios and motivate further adoption and development across AI safety and cybersecurity research communities."
