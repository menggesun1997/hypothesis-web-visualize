        "title": "Adaptive Cyber-Human Vulnerability Mapping and Trust-Calibration Framework for Hallucination Mitigation in AI Financial Advisors",
        "Problem_Statement": "Hallucination propagation in AI-driven financial advisory systems commonly stems from complex vulnerabilities at the human-technology interface. Existing approaches insufficiently integrate multi-modal technical and communication data, lack adaptive trust calibration mechanisms, and do not align with industry cybersecurity standards, limiting effective identification and proactive mitigation of these issues in real-world financial contexts.",
        "Motivation": "This research addresses a critical gap by developing a rigorously integrated, adaptive cyber-human vulnerability mapping framework that combines cybersecurity risk management, organizational digital transformation insights, and qualitative communication analysis. Unlike prior work, it incorporates real-time trust calibration and human-in-the-loop feedback to dynamically identify and mitigate hallucination risks, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. This multifaceted approach advances the state-of-the-art in AI-human collaboration, trust management, and cyber risk mitigation specifically tailored for financial AI advisory systems, elevating both novelty and practical impact.",
        "Proposed_Method": "The proposed method constructs a comprehensive, multi-layered framework integrating: (1) Cybersecurity risk assessment aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, tailored to AI advisory data flows, user interactions, and access controls; (2) A structured qualitative component involving semi-structured interviews and surveys with financial advisors and IT/ cybersecurity officers to capture communication patterns and user behaviors; (3) Automated logging and NLP-based real-time detection of potential hallucination events in AI outputs, harnessing GPT-variant models fine-tuned to flag uncertain or hallucinated advisories; (4) A multimodal data fusion mechanism employing a mixed-methods data integration model—combining temporal alignment, entity correlation, and probabilistic causal inference—to link qualitative insights with technical logs, clarifying vulnerability causation beyond correlation; (5) An adaptive trust calibration module that dynamically adjusts AI advisory confidence levels and human interface cues based on detected hallucination risk, providing proactive alerts; (6) A human-in-the-loop feedback protocol enabling advisors to provide corrections that continuously refine the hallucination detection models and risk mappings; and (7) Rigorous evaluation protocols including A/B testing, controlled user studies, and longitudinal monitoring of remediation interventions (e.g., UI redesign, communication training). This integrated framework ensures precise, reproducible identification of actionable vulnerabilities and embeds proactive mitigation strategies enhancing real-time human-AI collaboration in financial advising environments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Secure organizational partnerships with financial advisory firms ensuring ethical approvals and privacy safeguards compliant with regulatory standards; 2) Conduct a power analysis to justify a target sample size of 30-50 advisors and 10-15 IT security officers for qualitative interviews and surveys, with iterative recruitment strategies to maximize representation; 3) Develop interview and survey instruments focused on communication breakdowns, risk perceptions, and user decision-making processes; 4) Collect system logs and incident reports with detailed, standardized hallucination labeling protocols developed in collaboration with domain experts; 5) Deploy NLP-based real-time hallucination detectors on advisory transcripts and AI outputs, continuously validated against labeled incidents; 6) Implement the multimodal data fusion model integrating qualitative and quantitative data streams, followed by vulnerability hotspot mapping using probabilistic causal frameworks; 7) Design and execute remediation interventions—such as UI tweaks highlighting uncertainty and targeted staff training modules—evaluated via randomized controlled trials and A/B testing with performance metrics including reduction in hallucination acceptance and improved trust calibration; 8) Establish continuous human-in-the-loop feedback to iteratively refine AI models and risk maps; 9) Conduct longitudinal monitoring over 6-12 months to assess durability and generalizability of outcomes; and 10) Incorporate comprehensive documentation of privacy, data governance, and integration challenges with mitigation strategies to ensure replicability and ethical compliance.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: Dialogue transcript and system logs from a financial advisor session where AI provides an investment recommendation containing a hallucinated performance claim. Real-time NLP detectors flag uncertainty; multimodal fusion links this flag to observed advisor confusion and misinterpretation of UI disclaimers identified through interview data. Example Output: Identification of causal vulnerabilities including UI design flaws and communication protocol mismatches leading to hallucination acceptance; adaptive UI warnings and real-time trust scores issued to advisor; recommendations for improved training on interpreting AI advisories; iterative refinement of hallucination detection models through advisor feedback; demonstrable reduction in similar incidents in controlled trials.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If qualitative interview recruitment is limited, supplement with expanded large-scale surveys combined with automated communication risk signal extraction via advanced NLP classifiers trained on existing corpora. In cases where system log detail or labeling is insufficient, implement enhanced logging protocols and active human annotation sessions to generate validated datasets. If organizational buy-in for controlled trials is constrained, utilize simulated environments with recruited users to approximate real-world decision-making. For privacy constraints, apply federated learning techniques to enable decentralized model training without compromising sensitive data. The human-in-the-loop feedback system is designed to incrementally enhance detection robustness even under limited initial data, ensuring progressive model improvement and system adaptability."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a hybrid vulnerability mapping framework combining cybersecurity risk tools, qualitative interviews, and automated hallucination incident tracing, but lacks clarity on how these components will be technically integrated. The protocol for effectively linking qualitative communication data with technical logs, and how this fusion will pinpoint actionable vulnerabilities, is not well articulated. A more detailed mechanism describing data flow, integration points, and analytical methods is needed to ensure the approach is rigorous and reproducible, thereby strengthening the soundness of the method section as well as its potential to yield valid findings relevant for both cybersecurity and communication disciplines within financial AI advisory contexts. Consider including explicit frameworks or models for multimodal data fusion and justification of linking criteria between human interactions and AI hallucination events to improve clarity and mechanistic soundness in \"Proposed_Method.\" This will help address ambiguities about causality or correlation in vulnerability identification and mitigate assumptions underlying the integration approach that could undermine reproducibility and validity of results. Targeting this clarification upfront will also improve reviewer and stakeholder confidence in the proposed contributions and experimental design’s capacity to uncover meaningful, actionable vulnerabilities.  The current description risks being perceived as overly high-level or conceptual, lacking in precise methodological detail necessary for sound validation of conclusions later in the study phases, especially given the competitive nature of this research space.  \n\nPlease enhance the clarity, precision, and feasibility of the core method integration in \"Proposed_Method.\"  This is critical for ensuring the study rigor and impact potential are clear to reviewers and implementers alike.  \n\nIn summary: please elaborate on the methodological integration mechanism, data types to be fused, and analytic strategies explicitly within \"Proposed_Method.\"  This is the biggest current gap impacting soundness and clarity at the core of this work.  \n\nThis is a MUST address critique to improve clarity and soundness in the proposal's main scientific contribution section.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is commendably detailed but risks potential feasibility issues particularly regarding data access, scale, and generalizability. Interviewing financial advisors and IT security officers may yield limited qualitative data that is not representative, and mitigating this risk only through surveys and NLP may not fully substitute for rich interview insights. Additionally, reliance on system logs and incident reports assumes they are sufficiently detailed and accurately labeled for hallucination events, which may not hold in all real-world organizational contexts. The plan does not clarify safeguards or contingencies around data quality, privacy concerns, or integration challenges between qualitative and technical datasets. Further, the design does not specify how remediation strategies (UI redesign, staff training) will be practically evaluated—e.g., will there be controlled trials, A/B tests, or longitudinal monitoring? Such methodological gaps reduce confidence in the plan's viability and ability to deliver measurable impact within typical project timeframes.\n\nTo improve feasibility, the authors should incorporate clearer plans for (1) sample size justification and access strategy including realistic organizational commitments, (2) data validation and labeling standards for hallucination incident logs, (3) ethical/privacy frameworks to handle sensitive financial advisory data, and (4) rigorous evaluation protocols for remediation testing.\n\nAddressing these feasibility aspects will significantly strengthen the experimental plan's robustness and practicality, thereby increasing the likelihood the proposed research is both executable and impactful.\n\nThis feedback addresses critical execution risks that must be thoroughly mitigated to ensure this promising conceptual framework can yield concrete, generalizable contributions in realistic organizational environments.\n\nPlease revise the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan accordingly to incorporate these feasibility enhancements and contingencies."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the assessment of competitive novelty and the proposal's emphasis on hallucination mitigation in financial AI advising, integrating concepts related to 'trust calibration,' 'human-in-the-loop,' and 'proactive defense strategy' from globally-linked concepts could substantially improve impact and broaden appeal. Specifically, embedding adaptive trust calibration mechanisms that adjust AI advisory outputs or human interaction modalities based on real-time assessments of hallucination risk would advance the state-of-the-art in human-AI collaboration and cyber risk management. This could involve leveraging natural language processing models (e.g., GPT variants) to dynamically detect and flag uncertain or potentially hallucinated AI outputs, thus proactively informing advisors and enhancing decision-making accuracy. Including a human-in-the-loop feedback protocol with continuous model refinement from user corrections would further strengthen the framework’s robustness and responsiveness. Coupling these with established cybersecurity frameworks (e.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework) would also cement the solution’s practical relevance and alignment with industry standards. \n\nThis multi-pronged augmentation would both deepen the novelty beyond mapping vulnerabilities and extend its practical impact by enabling real-time, adaptive mitigation strategies rather than purely post hoc analysis. It also better aligns with highly competitive AI-human collaboration research directions and emerging needs in trusted automated financial advisories.\n\nI recommend the authors consider expanding their framework to incorporate these complementary concepts from the global literature and linked ideas to elevate the project's contribution and appeal."
