    "title": "Dynamic Ontology-Driven Prompt Engineering for Domain-Shift Robust Legal LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Static fine-tuning strategies fail to dynamically adjust to evolving legal domains and heterogeneous document types, resulting in persistent domain-shift vulnerabilities in large language models.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gaps in model adaptability and lack of dynamic domain calibration by introducing ontology-driven prompt engineering that allows on-the-fly domain shifts handling based on formal symbolic legal knowledge representations.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a system that dynamically generates fine-tuning prompts embedding up-to-date ontology fragments representing relevant legal concepts for target documents. These prompts calibrate LLM outputs contextually, improving robustness and performance without exhaustive retraining.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct modular legal ontologies that can be selectively incorporated. 2) Develop a prompt generator that encodes ontology fragments into few-shot learning contexts. 3) Evaluate on diverse legal tasks with varying domain shifts and compare with fixed fine-tuning.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A prompt for contract clause classification dynamically augmented with specific commercial contract ontology elements. Output: Enhanced classification accuracy and domain-aware explanations reflecting ontology integration.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic prompt engineering yields limited gains, fallback to adapter-based fine-tuning methods incorporating similar ontology knowledge or hierarchical multi-task learning frameworks."

However, the mechanism by which these ontology fragments are selected, encoded, integrated into prompts, and how they concretely influence the model's generation or classification is not sufficiently detailed. Clarify and provide a well-reasoned explanation of how the ontology-driven prompt engineering operates end-to-end, including handling potential inconsistencies or ambiguities in legal ontologies, prompt length constraints, and how dynamic shifts are detected and incorporated during inference. This clarity is critical for evaluating the soundness of the approach and ensuring that the underlying assumptions are valid and actionable in practice, rather than hypothetical or underspecified assumptions of seamless integration between symbolic ontology fragments and LLM prompt tuning capabilities.\n\nEnhancements could include examples illustrating the prompt generation process step-by-step, and discussing potential failure modes and their mitigation strategies within the prompt engineering framework."

For instance, constructing modular legal ontologies is a non-trivial task often requiring expert domain knowledge and extensive validation â€” how will ontology fragments be maintained and updated over time, and how will their quality be assessed? The plan to develop a prompt generator encoding ontology fragments needs clarification about the representation formats and integration with LLM prompt contexts, as well as quantitative metrics beyond classification accuracy (e.g., robustness measures against domain shifts, explanation faithfulness). Additionally, evaluating on diverse legal tasks requires specifying datasets, baseline models, metrics, and statistical testing protocols to robustly compare with fixed fine-tuning methods.\n\nProviding a more comprehensive and practical experimental roadmap that addresses these aspects will strengthen confidence in the feasibility of the approach and its rigorous validation."
