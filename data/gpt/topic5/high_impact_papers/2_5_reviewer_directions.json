    "title": "Integrating Gig Worker Feedback Loops to Enhance LLM Translation Robustness",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs used in autonomous agents for online translation lack mechanisms to incorporate real-time feedback from gig workers, limiting adaptation to adversarial inputs affecting translation fairness and quality.",
    "Motivation": "Expands the 'online translation' and 'digital labour' hidden bridge by formalizing a continuous feedback and adaptation loop from human gig workers into translation module robustness, an under-explored cross-disciplinary gap.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build an interactive system that (1) Collects and anonymizes corrections and fairness concerns from gig workers in deployment; (2) Uses active learning to incorporate this feedback into incremental updates of translation memory and retraining; (3) Implements adversarial anomaly detection flagging suspicious inputs for heightened attention; (4) Monitors fairness budgets to ensure socio-technical fairness is maintained over time.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Deploy pilot autonomous agent with feedback collection interfaces for gig workers. 2) Aggregate and curate feedback into training data. 3) Perform incremental model updates using feedback in adversarial robustness conditioning. 4) Evaluate improvements in translation fairness, adversarial resistance, and worker reported satisfaction compared to baseline static models.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Gig worker flags a biased translation segment as unfair or adversarially induced. Expected Output: Model update incorporates correction to prevent recurrence, improves fairness metrics, and documents change for transparency.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time feedback integration slows system updates or induces instability, implement batch update cycles or semi-automated review systems blending human moderation and model retraining."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines several components—feedback collection, active learning for incremental updates, adversarial anomaly detection, and fairness monitoring—but lacks detailed mechanistic clarity on integration and interaction among these components. For example, the specific strategies for anonymizing feedback while preserving its utility, the technical design of the active learning loop, and how adversarial detection informs model updates remain underspecified. Without a precise mechanism, it is challenging to assess the method's robustness or technical feasibility. Clarify the architectures, data flow, and adaptation routines to strengthen soundness and reproducibility in this critical section of the proposal, ensuring alignment with the stated goals of fairness and robustness adaptation. This will also help in assessing feasibility and potential for incremental learning in deployment conditions with noisy human feedback, which is inherently challenging and nontrivial to handle from a system perspective—highlight any assumptions or safeguards there as well, to avoid hidden weak points in the method's design and implementation planning."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan proposes deploying a pilot with real-time feedback collection, then curating and using it for incremental model updates, followed by evaluation of fairness and adversarial robustness improvements. However, the plan does not specify methods for reliable feedback aggregation and data quality control, which are crucial given the likely noisy, biased, or conflicting gig worker inputs. Additionally, the pilot scale, metrics for 'worker reported satisfaction,' baseline comparisons, timeline for updates, and evaluation methodology (quantitative and qualitative) are underdeveloped. Real-time feedback integration risks system instability and latency, but the fallback plan is vaguely described without concrete decision criteria or thresholds triggering batch updates or human moderation. Strengthen the experiment plan by detailing dataset curation protocols, clearly defining evaluation metrics and baselines, explicitly describing update schedules that balance responsiveness and system stability, and specifying protocols to validate feedback utility prior to retraining—this will elevate feasibility and rigor for the research impact claims."
