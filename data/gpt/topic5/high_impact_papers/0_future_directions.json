        "title": "Dynamic Cross-Domain Verification Framework for Real-time AI Financial Advisory Outputs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Financial advisory systems powered by LLMs face significant risk of hallucination and misinformation, threatening investor trust and regulatory compliance. Existing methods lack real-time, cross-disciplinary verification integrating organizational communication and technical safeguards to ensure output accuracy.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of lacking robust, standardized frameworks for real-time verification and risk management by synthesizing communication research frameworks with dynamic information security protocols inspired by health informatics.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a dynamic cross-domain verification system combining: (1) a communication-theoretic module analyzing content dissemination and interpretation patterns in outputs; (2) a health informatics-derived real-time collaboration protocol ensuring multiple orthogonal expert validations (e.g., financial domain experts, cybersecurity modules) before output release; (3) an AI-powered discrepancy detection layer flagging hallucinated content. This multi-agent, protocol-driven verification approach adapts continuously to organizational transformations, incorporating feedback loops for evolving threat vectors.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets from financial advisory conversations and AI outputs involving potential hallucinations. 2) Implement baseline LLM advisory models (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4) and existing hallucination detectors. 3) Build the communication-based content interpretability module using communication theories and NLP classifiers. 4) Integrate with a simulation of real-time collaborative verification modeled on health information systems. 5) Evaluate via precision/recall on hallucination detection, latency overhead, and user trust metrics via expert panels.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An AI-generated financial recommendation mentioning an investment opportunity with unsupported statistics and fabricating past performance. Expected Output: The system flags unsupported statistics in real-time, routes the output through a simulated expert verification channel, which corrects misinformation or halts dissemination with warnings.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the collaborative verification introduces unacceptable latency, explore asynchronous verification combined with confidence scoring to prioritize critical alerts. Alternatively, enhance the discrepancy detection module with stronger domain-specific knowledge graphs for intrinsic hallucination detection."

        "title": "Adaptive AI Governance Model Embedding Digital Leadership for Ethical Financial Advisory LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Financial institutions incorporating large language models into advisory roles lack adaptive governance frameworks that continuously assess risk, enforce ethics, and mitigate biases as organizational digital transformation unfolds.",
        "Motivation": "Directly responds to the external gap of absent fusion between organizational learning capacity, digital leadership models from psychology/management, and AI governance in finance, proposing a novel interdisciplinary governance architecture.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive AI governance framework embedding digital leadership constructs by: (1) modeling digital leadership behaviors and organizational learning cycles as computational entities; (2) implementing a continuous risk assessment engine for AI outputs using organizational feedback loops and real-time monitoring; (3) incorporating ethical oversight protocols that dynamically evolve under organizational transformation stimuli. The framework incorporates psychological models to simulate and predict governance efficacy, allowing proactive policy adjustments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather organizational digital transformation case studies and leadership assessments. 2) Implement simulation environments modeling leadership influence on AI governance decisions. 3) Develop and integrate continuous risk and bias monitoring tools leveraging LLM interpretability advances. 4) Validate with controlled deployments in simulated financial advisory workflows, measuring governance adaptability, ethical incident reduction, and stakeholder satisfaction.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Introduction of a novel AI advisory feature increases hallucination risk. Output: The governance model detects elevated risk, simulates leadership interventions, deploys updated policies to mitigate bias/hallucination, and learns from feedback to refine future governance responses.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If organizational learning cycles prove too complex to model computationally, simplify models focusing on key leadership signals and incorporate human-in-the-loop policy adjustment mechanisms to maintain adaptability."

        "title": "Cyber-Human Interaction Vulnerability Mapping for Hallucination Mitigation in AI Financial Advisors",
        "Problem_Statement": "Hallucination propagation in AI-driven financial advisory systems often arises from vulnerabilities at the human-technology interface, yet current methods inadequately identify or remediate these issues combining cybersecurity risk and communication research methodologies.",
        "Motivation": "Fills the gap linking cybersecurity risk management, organizational digital transformation, and qualitative communication-based empirical methods to specifically target human-technology interaction weaknesses influencing misinformation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create a hybrid vulnerability mapping framework combining: (1) cybersecurity risk assessment tools tailored to AI advisory data flows and user interfaces; (2) interview-driven qualitative analysis of user behaviors and communication patterns within financial organizations; (3) automated tracing of hallucination-origin incidents cross-referenced with human interaction points to identify systemic vulnerabilities. This dual-method approach enables targeted technical and organizational mitigations.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Design interview protocols interviewing financial advisors and IT security officers. 2) Collect AI advisory system logs and incident reports involving misinformation. 3) Apply cybersecurity risk frameworks to these data, identifying interface vulnerabilities. 4) Correlate qualitative findings with technical logs to map human-technology risk hotspots. 5) Test remediation strategies, such as UI redesign or staff training, and measure hallucination incident reductions.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Transcript and log from a financial advisor interfacing with AI delivering questionable investment advice. Output: Identification of misinterpretation patterns around disclaimers and system UI confusion leading to hallucination acceptance; suggestions for UI and communication protocol changes.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If interviews have limited scale, augment with large-scale survey data and employ natural language processing to automate extraction of communication risk signals. Consider automated user behavior analytics as supplemental data."

        "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Hallucination Risk Quantification Metric Integrating Communication and Cybersecurity Perspectives",
        "Problem_Statement": "There is no standardized metric quantitatively assessing hallucination risk in AI-generated financial advisory content that incorporates both communication dissemination dynamics and cybersecurity threat modeling.",
        "Motivation": "Responds to the critical internal gap of lacking robust risk quantification frameworks by synthesizing communication research on information spread with cybersecurity risk metrics, establishing a novel hybrid hallucination risk score.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a composite hallucination risk quantification metric combining: (1) communication-derived parameters such as source credibility, message ambiguity, and propagation velocity; (2) cybersecurity threat model components like vulnerability exposure, attack surface related to AI outputs, and mitigation readiness; (3) integration into an interpretable scoring system that can be applied in real-time to each AI-generated advisory message to guide risk-aware delivery.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Review literature to identify key parameters in communication and cybersecurity domains relating to misinformation. 2) Collect annotated AI advisory datasets with hallucination labeling. 3) Define and calibrate metric components using machine learning techniques. 4) Validate metric by comparing system risk scores to actual hallucination incidence and expert assessments. 5) Benchmark against existing hallucination/confidence metrics for interpretability and usefulness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI advisory message flagged with high ambiguity and originating from less monitored AI subprocess, resulting in a high composite risk score. Output: Advisory is delayed for further verification or flagged with transparent warnings to end users, reducing harm potential.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If composite scoring proves too complex for real-time use, develop separate partial metrics for communication and cybersecurity, then combine via heuristic thresholds until full integration is optimized."

        "Motivation": "Inspired by health informatics multi-professional real-time collaboration, this idea fills the gap of integrating real-time, cross-functional expert validation and communication within AI advisory platforms, a missing bridge in current practice.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop and integrate a real-time collaboration protocol leveraging multi-agent systems where financial analysts, compliance officers, and AI systems interact synchronously during advisory generation. The protocol defines communication channels, roles, and automated arbitration rules to identify and resolve hallucinations before user delivery, embedding robust information security and privacy controls from health systems.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Model existing financial advisory workflows and identify key professional roles. 2) Implement communication and collaboration modules simulating expert involvement in AI output validation. 3) Integrate privacy-preserving encryption and access controls adopted from health informatics. 4) Test with simulated advisory sessions involving LLMs generating recommendations, measuring hallucination incidence before and after protocol adoption.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI generates a complex portfolio suggestion with uncertain data points. Output: Compliance and financial experts receive alerts, collaborate in real-time to verify/refute hallucinated info, and finalize the advisory output collaboratively, increasing reliability.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time collaboration proves operationally infeasible, explore asynchronous multi-professional review systems with rapid feedback loops and advanced notification mechanisms."
