        "title": "Context-Aware, Multimodal Risk-Communicated LLM Decision Summaries for Multi-Stakeholder Healthcare Environments",
        "Problem_Statement": "Healthcare stakeholders—including clinicians, patients, and caregivers—face significant challenges interpreting LLM-generated decision recommendations due to insufficient transparency, lack of contextualization with real-time patient data, and limited nuanced communication of risk, bias, and uncertainty. This impairs trust, comprehension, and adoption of AI-driven decision support tools in complex, distributed clinical settings where stakeholder knowledge levels, cultural backgrounds, and roles vary widely.",
        "Motivation": "While existing AI interpretability and risk communication research advances presentation of model outputs, there is a critical gap in integrating real-world, multimodal patient context such as wearable sensor-based human activity recognition and clinical documentation into communication frameworks. By fusing sensor-derived objective health indicators and clinical notes with LLM explanations, this project offers a novel, personalized, and temporally relevant approach to risk-communicated summaries tailored to diverse healthcare stakeholders. This integration enhances explanatory power, trust, and clinical decision alignment beyond prior static or generic models, addressing challenges endemic to distributed healthcare decision-making and supporting adoption in practical workflows. The combination of interdisciplinary risk communication theories, AI interpretability, and sensor data fusion represents a competitively innovative step forward for impactful, multimodal personalized AI decision support.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular, context-aware decision summary generation framework that fuses LLM outputs with wearable sensor-based human activity recognition data and recent clinical documentation to produce layered, modality-rich summaries customized for distinct stakeholder groups. Key components include: (1) multimodal data integration pipelines that aggregate LLM recommendations, wearable sensor signals reflecting real-time patient activity and physiological status, and pertinent clinical note excerpts; (2) an adaptive communication module applying evidence-based risk communication principles—such as message framing, uncertainty visualization, and bias disclosure—tailored to stakeholders' linguistic, cultural, and cognitive characteristics profiled via user modeling; (3) an interactive multimedia interface combining natural language explanations with intuitive visualizations of sensor trends and document highlights, enabling dynamic exploration of AI decision rationale contextualized by up-to-date patient data. This cross-disciplinary approach leverages learning techniques from sensor-based human activity recognition and clinical AI evaluation metrics to enhance explanatory richness, stakeholder trust, and practical utility in multi-stakeholder healthcare environments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble a multi-institutional dataset combining diverse healthcare communication records, wearable sensor streams (e.g., accelerometer, heart rate), and associated clinical documentation from heterogeneous patient populations representing varying demographics, cultures, and clinical contexts (e.g., ambulatory care, emergency departments). 2. Develop LLM decision models supplemented with modules quantifying bias and uncertainty, integrating sensor-derived patient activity recognition outputs and tagged clinical note sections relevant to decision risk. 3. Architect adaptive communication modules employing layered message framing and multimodal explanation techniques, informed by detailed stakeholder profiling capturing knowledge level, cultural background, and decision role diversity. 4. Conduct iterative mixed-methods user studies exceeding laboratory settings by implementing pilot deployments within real clinical environments (ambulatory clinics, hospital wards), involving clinicians, patients, and caregivers; evaluate comprehensive outcomes including comprehension, trust, decision satisfaction, workflow efficiency, and clinical impact metrics such as decision alignment and patient safety indicators. 5. Refine framework components based on qualitative feedback and quantitative assessments, emphasizing pragmatic adoption barriers and enhancements. 6. Benchmark against baseline LLM outputs without contextual fusion using robust metrics including comprehension tests, trust scales, clinical workflow metrics, and patient outcome proxies to validate real-world feasibility and impact. 7. Plan longitudinal follow-up studies for sustained clinical adoption and outcome monitoring.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An LLM recommends a medication regimen with potential side effects, informed by recent patient physical activity (detected via wearable accelerometers as reduced mobility) and clinical documentation noting prior adverse reactions. Output: For clinicians, a layered summary presenting drug efficacy statistics, bias in training data, uncertainty intervals, and integrated visual timelines of recent patient activity patterns and flagged clinical notes indicating heightened risk, enabling nuanced clinical judgment. For patients and caregivers, simplified language explanations accompanied by intuitive graphics displaying current physical activity trends, medication benefits and risks, and cautions grounded in individual context. Expected Outcome: Enhanced stakeholder comprehension, personalized risk awareness, increased confidence in the AI recommendation, and improved clinical decision alignment leading to safer, more effective care.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal multimedia explanations prove overly complex or intrusive in specific clinical contexts, fallback strategies include deploying minimalistic, context-sensitive textual warnings augmented with voice-assisted summaries tailored via user profiling. Additionally, if sensor data integration encounters barriers such as data quality or privacy concerns, the system can focus temporarily on enhanced risk communication grounded solely in clinical documentation and LLM outputs, gradually reincorporating sensor data as feasibility improves. User-driven customization and AI-adaptive feedback loops will continuously optimize communication style and content to maximize usability while mitigating cognitive overload and deployment risks."

          "feedback_content": "The experiment plan appears comprehensive but lacks explicit consideration of integration challenges within real clinical workflows and stakeholder diversity. Clarify how the collected datasets and user studies will represent the varied knowledge levels, cultural backgrounds, and decision-making roles of clinicians, patients, and caregivers to ensure feasibility and generalizability. Additionally, detail plans for iterative testing environments beyond lab settings, such as pilot deployments in ambulatory or hospital contexts to validate practical utility and adoption barriers effectively. This will strengthen empirical grounding and feasibility claims of the proposed method in complex healthcare settings where decision-making is distributed and context-dependent, enhancing the credibility and translational potential of the work. Consider also specifying metrics and protocols for assessing impact on actual clinical outcomes or workflow efficiency, not just comprehension and trust scores, to better demonstrate real-world efficacy and feasibility of adoption in healthcare systems.  \n\nIn summary, focus on augmenting the experimental plan with explicit multi-stakeholder representation, real-world testing scenarios, and outcome-oriented evaluation to robustly establish feasibility and scientific rigour of the proposed approach in real healthcare environments, beyond simulated user studies alone.  \n\nThis refinement is crucial given the complex sociotechnical nature of healthcare decision support and the diverse user groups targeted by the communication framework, ensuring the method can be responsibly and effectively deployed at scale in practice environments beyond initial prototypes or controlled experiments.  \n\nA stronger feasibility demonstration here will strongly support acceptance by clinical stakeholders and funding or deployment partners who require clear evidence of real-world impact and usability in their workflows and patient populations to move past theoretical or lab-based promise to practical adoption and benefit realization.  \n\nHence, please augment and clarify the scope, methods, and evaluation details in the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan accordingly to minimize deployment risks and maximize adoption potential early in the research lifecycle, creating a robust foundation for follow-up innovation and longitudinal impact studies that are critically needed in AI-driven healthcare decision support fields.  \n\nDetailed stakeholder profiling, iterative piloting, and mixed-method outcome evaluation must be explicitly integrated into the experimental plan for convincing proof of concept and clinical viability of the risk-communicated LLM summaries approach you propose.  \n\nThis focus on feasibility refinement should be prioritized as it underpins all claims of impact and soundness, balancing ambitious design with practical validation needs inherent in this high-stakes clinical AI context.  \n\nHope this guidance helps sharpen your experimental design into a compelling roadmap that meets rigorous peer expectations and real-world demands simultaneously.

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the broad existing literature linking interpretability, risk communication, and decision support in healthcare AI, a concrete way to enhance novelty and impact is to explicitly integrate sensor-based human activity recognition data and clinical documentation into the decision summaries as contextual evidence. For example, incorporating wearable sensor-derived patient activity or physiological data signals can enrich LLM decision explanations and risk communication with real-time objective health status indicators, enabling more personalized and temporally relevant risk framing tailored to patients’ current condition. \n\nConcretely, this integration would draw on global health system research around 'wearable sensor data', 'human activity recognition', and 'clinical documentation' to not just communicate AI model output risk and bias abstractly, but ground them in rich multimodal patient context dynamically captured in daily living and clinical settings, increasing explanatory power and stakeholder trust.  \n\nThis multimodal fusion can power advanced communication interfaces combining LLM natural language with intuitive visualizations of sensor trends and clinical note excerpts highlighting pertinent risks and uncertainties from recent patient behavior or status changes, going beyond static or generic summaries.  \n\nSuch an approach would leverage learning techniques from sensor-based activity recognition research and evaluation metrics established in clinical AI, bridging the gap between AI interpretability, real-world patient monitoring, and enriched stakeholder communication. This would improve clinical decision alignment, safety, and patient empowerment through truly context-aware, trustworthy AI explanations in healthcare environments, markedly advancing state of the art and impact.  \n\nTherefore, I strongly suggest revisiting your framework design to incorporate wearable sensor and activity data integration alongside existing LLM outputs and risk communication methods, positioning your work at the forefront of personalized, multimodal AI decision support research for healthcare stakeholders.  \n\nThis direction could substantially elevate your proposal’s novelty, competitive edge, and ultimate utility in complex, data-rich clinical environments where multiple stakeholders collaborate on care, perfectly aligned with the globally linked concepts you have listed. \n\nLooking forward to seeing how this integration can push your innovative decision summary communication approach to new heights in healthcare AI impact.  \n\nThank you!  \n-\nReviewer 1 (Area Chair)"
