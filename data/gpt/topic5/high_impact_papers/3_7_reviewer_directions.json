    "title": "Real-Time Recovery via Supervisory Control in Multi-Modal Scientific Data Fusion",
    "Problem_Statement": "In multimodal scientific data mining (text, images, tables), current language models lack real-time adaptive recovery mechanisms to maintain performance under computational resource fluctuations, increasing environmental cost.",
    "Motivation": "This proposal exploits the hidden bridge linking supervisory control practices from robotics to scientific literature mining, designing recovery strategies that trigger model adaptation and resource reallocation in real-time for multi-modal inputs under resource constraints.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement a supervisory controller monitoring model performance across modalities and available hardware resources. The controller dynamically triggers recovery actions such as modality switching, selective attention recalibration, or lightweight re-encoding to maintain inference quality with minimal extra computation. Use adaptive control theory and reinforcement learning to optimize policies for energy-performance tradeoffs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble multi-modal scientific datasets (text+image+tables).\n2. Develop baseline multi-modal language model architectures.\n3. Integrate resource monitoring and supervisory control modules.\n4. Train adaptive recovery policies via RL.\n5. Evaluate model robustness, resource usage, and recovery latency under varying hardware constraints.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multi-modal data describing experimental setups.\nExpected Output: Model selectively reduces attention on image modality during GPU load peaks, maintaining >90% F1 on extraction tasks while reducing energy spikes by 30%.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If RL training is unstable for recovery policies, fallback to rule-based supervisory triggers or use offline policy learning with pre-collected usage data."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines use of supervisory control combined with RL for adaptive recovery, but lacks clarity on the precise control signals, model interfaces, and decision-making criteria within the supervisory controller. Detailing how modalities are monitored, what triggers recovery actions, and how RL policies interact with control theory principles would strengthen the soundness and reproducibility of the approach. Clear diagrams or pseudocode could help elucidate the mechanism and its integration within multimodal architectures, reducing conceptual ambiguity and supporting validation efforts early on in the project timeline.—target_section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as 'NOV-COMPETITIVE,' integrating concepts from multi-agent and self-adaptive software systems could substantially enhance both impact and novelty. Specifically, framing the supervisory controller as a multi-agent architecture enabling collaborative decision-making across distributed computational resources (akin to multi-robot or swarm systems) could improve robustness and scalability. Leveraging agent-oriented software engineering may also provide modular design patterns for adaptive control policies. This alignment would position the work to address broader software robustness and adaptability challenges beyond scientific data mining, thereby potentially increasing cross-domain contributions.—target_section: Proposed_Method"
