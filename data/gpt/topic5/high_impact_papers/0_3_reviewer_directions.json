    "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Hallucination Risk Quantification Metric Integrating Communication and Cybersecurity Perspectives",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is no standardized metric quantitatively assessing hallucination risk in AI-generated financial advisory content that incorporates both communication dissemination dynamics and cybersecurity threat modeling.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to the critical internal gap of lacking robust risk quantification frameworks by synthesizing communication research on information spread with cybersecurity risk metrics, establishing a novel hybrid hallucination risk score.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a composite hallucination risk quantification metric combining: (1) communication-derived parameters such as source credibility, message ambiguity, and propagation velocity; (2) cybersecurity threat model components like vulnerability exposure, attack surface related to AI outputs, and mitigation readiness; (3) integration into an interpretable scoring system that can be applied in real-time to each AI-generated advisory message to guide risk-aware delivery.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Review literature to identify key parameters in communication and cybersecurity domains relating to misinformation. 2) Collect annotated AI advisory datasets with hallucination labeling. 3) Define and calibrate metric components using machine learning techniques. 4) Validate metric by comparing system risk scores to actual hallucination incidence and expert assessments. 5) Benchmark against existing hallucination/confidence metrics for interpretability and usefulness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI advisory message flagged with high ambiguity and originating from less monitored AI subprocess, resulting in a high composite risk score. Output: Advisory is delayed for further verification or flagged with transparent warnings to end users, reducing harm potential.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If composite scoring proves too complex for real-time use, develop separate partial metrics for communication and cybersecurity, then combine via heuristic thresholds until full integration is optimized."

          "feedback_content": "While the composite metric proposal combining communication and cybersecurity parameters is a promising interdisciplinary approach, the current description lacks clarity on how these heterogeneous factors will be quantitatively integrated into a unified, interpretable risk score. Specifically, explicit mechanisms or models for weighting, normalization, and conflict resolution among parameters are not delineated, which raises concerns about sound interpretability and validity of the final metric. It is critical to define the mathematical formulation or algorithmic framework that governs this integration to ensure soundness and replicability of the method, as well as to justify why certain parameters are emphasized over others within the scoring system. This clarity will also directly influence feasibility and eventual impact of the metric in operational settings, as interpretability is key for stakeholder trust and adoption. I recommend elaborating a detailed methodological design section that demonstrates this integration process with formal definitions or model architectures, supported by theoretical or empirical rationale, before advancing to calibration or validation stages in the experiment plan. This step will strengthen the scientific rigor of the proposed method substantially in the 'Proposed_Method' section, making it clearer how the metric translates interdisciplinary concepts into quantitative hallucination risk assessment applicable to AI-generated financial advisory content."

          "feedback_code": "IMP-BROADEN_IMPACT",
          "feedback_content": "The current proposal focuses exclusively on AI-generated financial advisory messages, which, while important, limits the broader potential application and impact of the hallucination risk quantification metric. Given that hallucination risks and misinformation propagation are critical issues across many high-stakes domains—such as connected healthcare, critical infrastructure protection, and compliance with emerging AI regulatory frameworks like the Artificial Intelligence Act—expanding the scope to include or at least explicitly plan for adaptation to adjacent domains would significantly increase the relevance and impact of this work. For example, integrating considerations from legal duty frameworks or cyber risk management in safety-critical systems would enhance the metric's practical utility and scalability. I suggest that the authors include in their motivation and experimental plans a discussion on generalizability or modularity of their approach to domains beyond finance-oriented advisory, possibly by leveraging globally linked concepts such as proactive defense strategy, Internet of Medical Things, or digital services regulation. Doing so will strengthen the appeal of the contribution by showing it can influence multiple real-world scenarios and motivate further adoption and development across AI safety and cybersecurity research communities."
