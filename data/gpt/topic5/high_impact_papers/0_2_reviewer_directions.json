    "title": "Cyber-Human Interaction Vulnerability Mapping for Hallucination Mitigation in AI Financial Advisors",
    "Problem_Statement": "Hallucination propagation in AI-driven financial advisory systems often arises from vulnerabilities at the human-technology interface, yet current methods inadequately identify or remediate these issues combining cybersecurity risk and communication research methodologies.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the gap linking cybersecurity risk management, organizational digital transformation, and qualitative communication-based empirical methods to specifically target human-technology interaction weaknesses influencing misinformation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a hybrid vulnerability mapping framework combining: (1) cybersecurity risk assessment tools tailored to AI advisory data flows and user interfaces; (2) interview-driven qualitative analysis of user behaviors and communication patterns within financial organizations; (3) automated tracing of hallucination-origin incidents cross-referenced with human interaction points to identify systemic vulnerabilities. This dual-method approach enables targeted technical and organizational mitigations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Design interview protocols interviewing financial advisors and IT security officers. 2) Collect AI advisory system logs and incident reports involving misinformation. 3) Apply cybersecurity risk frameworks to these data, identifying interface vulnerabilities. 4) Correlate qualitative findings with technical logs to map human-technology risk hotspots. 5) Test remediation strategies, such as UI redesign or staff training, and measure hallucination incident reductions.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Transcript and log from a financial advisor interfacing with AI delivering questionable investment advice. Output: Identification of misinterpretation patterns around disclaimers and system UI confusion leading to hallucination acceptance; suggestions for UI and communication protocol changes.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If interviews have limited scale, augment with large-scale survey data and employ natural language processing to automate extraction of communication risk signals. Consider automated user behavior analytics as supplemental data."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a hybrid vulnerability mapping framework combining cybersecurity risk tools, qualitative interviews, and automated hallucination incident tracing, but lacks clarity on how these components will be technically integrated. The protocol for effectively linking qualitative communication data with technical logs, and how this fusion will pinpoint actionable vulnerabilities, is not well articulated. A more detailed mechanism describing data flow, integration points, and analytical methods is needed to ensure the approach is rigorous and reproducible, thereby strengthening the soundness of the method section as well as its potential to yield valid findings relevant for both cybersecurity and communication disciplines within financial AI advisory contexts. Consider including explicit frameworks or models for multimodal data fusion and justification of linking criteria between human interactions and AI hallucination events to improve clarity and mechanistic soundness in \"Proposed_Method.\" This will help address ambiguities about causality or correlation in vulnerability identification and mitigate assumptions underlying the integration approach that could undermine reproducibility and validity of results. Targeting this clarification upfront will also improve reviewer and stakeholder confidence in the proposed contributions and experimental design’s capacity to uncover meaningful, actionable vulnerabilities.  The current description risks being perceived as overly high-level or conceptual, lacking in precise methodological detail necessary for sound validation of conclusions later in the study phases, especially given the competitive nature of this research space.  \n\nPlease enhance the clarity, precision, and feasibility of the core method integration in \"Proposed_Method.\"  This is critical for ensuring the study rigor and impact potential are clear to reviewers and implementers alike.  \n\nIn summary: please elaborate on the methodological integration mechanism, data types to be fused, and analytic strategies explicitly within \"Proposed_Method.\"  This is the biggest current gap impacting soundness and clarity at the core of this work.  \n\nThis is a MUST address critique to improve clarity and soundness in the proposal's main scientific contribution section.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is commendably detailed but risks potential feasibility issues particularly regarding data access, scale, and generalizability. Interviewing financial advisors and IT security officers may yield limited qualitative data that is not representative, and mitigating this risk only through surveys and NLP may not fully substitute for rich interview insights. Additionally, reliance on system logs and incident reports assumes they are sufficiently detailed and accurately labeled for hallucination events, which may not hold in all real-world organizational contexts. The plan does not clarify safeguards or contingencies around data quality, privacy concerns, or integration challenges between qualitative and technical datasets. Further, the design does not specify how remediation strategies (UI redesign, staff training) will be practically evaluated—e.g., will there be controlled trials, A/B tests, or longitudinal monitoring? Such methodological gaps reduce confidence in the plan's viability and ability to deliver measurable impact within typical project timeframes.\n\nTo improve feasibility, the authors should incorporate clearer plans for (1) sample size justification and access strategy including realistic organizational commitments, (2) data validation and labeling standards for hallucination incident logs, (3) ethical/privacy frameworks to handle sensitive financial advisory data, and (4) rigorous evaluation protocols for remediation testing.\n\nAddressing these feasibility aspects will significantly strengthen the experimental plan's robustness and practicality, thereby increasing the likelihood the proposed research is both executable and impactful.\n\nThis feedback addresses critical execution risks that must be thoroughly mitigated to ensure this promising conceptual framework can yield concrete, generalizable contributions in realistic organizational environments.\n\nPlease revise the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan accordingly to incorporate these feasibility enhancements and contingencies."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the assessment of competitive novelty and the proposal's emphasis on hallucination mitigation in financial AI advising, integrating concepts related to 'trust calibration,' 'human-in-the-loop,' and 'proactive defense strategy' from globally-linked concepts could substantially improve impact and broaden appeal. Specifically, embedding adaptive trust calibration mechanisms that adjust AI advisory outputs or human interaction modalities based on real-time assessments of hallucination risk would advance the state-of-the-art in human-AI collaboration and cyber risk management. This could involve leveraging natural language processing models (e.g., GPT variants) to dynamically detect and flag uncertain or potentially hallucinated AI outputs, thus proactively informing advisors and enhancing decision-making accuracy. Including a human-in-the-loop feedback protocol with continuous model refinement from user corrections would further strengthen the framework’s robustness and responsiveness. Coupling these with established cybersecurity frameworks (e.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework) would also cement the solution’s practical relevance and alignment with industry standards. \n\nThis multi-pronged augmentation would both deepen the novelty beyond mapping vulnerabilities and extend its practical impact by enabling real-time, adaptive mitigation strategies rather than purely post hoc analysis. It also better aligns with highly competitive AI-human collaboration research directions and emerging needs in trusted automated financial advisories.\n\nI recommend the authors consider expanding their framework to incorporate these complementary concepts from the global literature and linked ideas to elevate the project's contribution and appeal."
