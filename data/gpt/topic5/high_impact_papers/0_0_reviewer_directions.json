    "title": "Dynamic Cross-Domain Verification Framework for Real-time AI Financial Advisory Outputs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Financial advisory systems powered by LLMs face significant risk of hallucination and misinformation, threatening investor trust and regulatory compliance. Existing methods lack real-time, cross-disciplinary verification integrating organizational communication and technical safeguards to ensure output accuracy.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of lacking robust, standardized frameworks for real-time verification and risk management by synthesizing communication research frameworks with dynamic information security protocols inspired by health informatics.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a dynamic cross-domain verification system combining: (1) a communication-theoretic module analyzing content dissemination and interpretation patterns in outputs; (2) a health informatics-derived real-time collaboration protocol ensuring multiple orthogonal expert validations (e.g., financial domain experts, cybersecurity modules) before output release; (3) an AI-powered discrepancy detection layer flagging hallucinated content. This multi-agent, protocol-driven verification approach adapts continuously to organizational transformations, incorporating feedback loops for evolving threat vectors.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets from financial advisory conversations and AI outputs involving potential hallucinations. 2) Implement baseline LLM advisory models (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4) and existing hallucination detectors. 3) Build the communication-based content interpretability module using communication theories and NLP classifiers. 4) Integrate with a simulation of real-time collaborative verification modeled on health information systems. 5) Evaluate via precision/recall on hallucination detection, latency overhead, and user trust metrics via expert panels.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An AI-generated financial recommendation mentioning an investment opportunity with unsupported statistics and fabricating past performance. Expected Output: The system flags unsupported statistics in real-time, routes the output through a simulated expert verification channel, which corrects misinformation or halts dissemination with warnings.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If the collaborative verification introduces unacceptable latency, explore asynchronous verification combined with confidence scoring to prioritize critical alerts. Alternatively, enhance the discrepancy detection module with stronger domain-specific knowledge graphs for intrinsic hallucination detection."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that a communication-theoretic module combined with health informatics-inspired protocols can effectively mitigate hallucinations in real-time AI financial advisory outputs. However, the feasibility of accurately modeling complex content dissemination and interpretation patterns in financial advice, especially under real-time constraints, is insufficiently justified. Further clarification is needed on how these communication theories concretely map to financial advisory AI outputs and how this integration will outperform or complement existing hallucination detection techniques. Strengthening this rationale with preliminary empirical evidence or pilot modeling results will improve soundness substantially, as it addresses a key assumption underlying the entire framework's novelty and effectiveness. Without this, the approach risks being theoretically elegant but practically fragile or misaligned with domain-specific nuances in financial advisory contexts; such a gap could undermine the method's validity and adoption potential. Please provide a deeper theoretical and practical grounding to solidify this core assumption and clarify the interaction between the communication module and other system components to prevent possible failures in real-world deployment scenarios. Targeting this will help validate that the foundational premise stands robust against domain challenges and dynamic AI output complexities in finance operations, especially with regulatory and trust imperatives that raise the stakes of hallucinated misinformation errors or latency-induced delays in verification cycles. This critique addresses the 'Proposed_Method' section for strengthening conceptual foundations and ensuring the core mechanism is coherent and realistic for the use case outlined. \"},"

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan outlines a comprehensive approach but lacks critical details concerning the operationalization and evaluation metrics that determine feasibility. Specifically, the plan needs to clarify how the simulation of the real-time collaborative verification protocol (inspired by health information systems) will realistically mimic organizational workflows and decision latencies in financial advisory environments. It should specify the roles, expertise, and interactions of expert validators incorporated, and how latency overhead due to multi-agent validation will be measured and mitigated. Additionally, the method to recruit or simulate domain experts, and the protocols for gathering and quantifying user trust metrics from expert panels, requires elaboration to ensure replicability and impact assessment validity. Also, the plan should delineate contingencies for scaling beyond simulations to deployment scenarios, and how asynchronous fallback solutions will be empirically compared to synchronous protocols. Addressing these gaps in the 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' will significantly enhance practical feasibility and confidence that the proposed system can meet real-world throughput and accuracy requirements while preserving stakeholder trust and regulatory compliance. Providing explicit, methodical details on experiment design, evaluation criteria, and real-time system constraints is imperative for convincing reviewers of the approach's valid execution potential and for guiding implementation iterations effectively."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty rating as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the global relevance of financial infrastructure, there is a valuable opportunity to enhance the proposal by explicitly integrating aspects of 'Critical Infrastructure Protection' (CIP). Embedding CIP principles—such as resilience under adversarial attacks, continuous monitoring, and layered defense strategies—could strengthen the framework's impact by positioning the verification system as a core safeguard for financial ecosystem stability. For example, augment the discrepancy detection layer with real-time threat intelligence feeds related to financial cyber-threats or data integrity compromises and incorporate CIP-aligned risk assessment metrics. This integration would provide a compelling cross-domain linkage that expands novelty and appeal, connecting AI hallucination mitigation with established priorities in safeguarding critical national and economic infrastructures. Such a concrete connection could also enable potential collaborations with infrastructure protection agencies or regulatory bodies, amplifying the research’s societal impact and accelerating adoption in critical financial institutions. We encourage the innovator to articulate this bridge clearly in motivation and methodology sections, thus situating the work within a broader, high-stakes domain relevant to both AI safety and critical infrastructure resilience."
