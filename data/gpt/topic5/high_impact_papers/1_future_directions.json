        "title": "Cognitive-AI Co-Mediation Framework for Bias Mitigation in Healthcare LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) in healthcare decision support often produce biased outputs due to data and model limitations, and these biases are poorly understood or communicated to healthcare professionals. There is no effective system that integrates unbiased human expertise and AI outputs through interactive communication to dynamically identify and mitigate such biases.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses internal and external gaps concerning the lack of integration between AI technological advances and communication, specifically bridging AI development with human-AI teaming frameworks. This novel approach leverages a human-AI co-mediation framework that combines human cognitive judgment with LLM outputs in a communicative loop to detect and mitigate bias dynamically.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an interactive AI system where healthcare professionals collaborate with an LLM through a structured dialogue interface. The system includes a bias detector module trained on known bias patterns, but critically, incorporates human-in-the-loop corrections that adapt model outputs via reinforcement learning from human feedback. Complementing this, an explanation communication layer translates model uncertainty and bias risk into intuitive visualizations and natural language alerts grounded in risk communication theories to enhance stakeholder understanding.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate a healthcare decision datasets with annotated bias instances (e.g., racial, gender bias).\n2. Build initial LLM models and train bias detectors.\n3. Develop the interactive communication interface embedding risk communication elements.\n4. Implement human-in-the-loop learning to dynamically update bias mitigation.\n5. Evaluate on real-world healthcare cases measuring bias reduction, user trust (via surveys), and decision accuracy compared to static LLM baselines.\n6. Conduct ablation studies to analyze contributions of communication interface and human feedback modules.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient description including minority ethnicity and symptoms.\nLLM output (biased): Treatment plan ignoring minority-specific complications.\nAfter human-AI co-mediation: System flags potential bias, provides explanation, healthcare professional iteratively adjusts plan with AI support resulting in a tailored, equitable treatment recommendation.\nExpected output: Transparent, bias-mitigated recommendation with documented rationale.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If human-in-the-loop adjustments are insufficient, investigate alternative bias detectors with multimodal inputs (e.g., medical images). If communication interface is ineffective, incorporate personalized user profiling to tailor message complexity and modality."

        "title": "Risk-Communicated LLM Decision Summaries for Multi-stakeholder Healthcare Environments",
        "Problem_Statement": "Healthcare stakeholders (e.g., clinicians, patients, caregivers) often struggle to interpret LLM recommendations due to lack of transparency and nuanced communication about risk and bias, resulting in reduced trust and uptake of AI-driven decision support.",
        "Motivation": "Directly targets the critical gap related to communication effectiveness and trust by applying interdisciplinary risk communication theories to AI outputs. Novel synthesis of communication research with AI model interpretability advances addresses how to present fairness and bias information effectively to diverse healthcare audiences.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a modular decision summary generation framework that converts LLM outputs into layered, risk-communicated summaries tailored for different stakeholder groups. Incorporate message framing, uncertainty visualization, and bias disclosure based on risk communication principles. Combine natural language generation with graphic media elements to provide interactive, multimedia explanations of AI decisions, supporting informed decision-making in clinical workflows.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect diverse healthcare datasets with patient-clinician communication records.\n2. Train LLM decision models and develop bias/uncertainty quantification modules.\n3. Design interfacing communication modules applying risk communication frameworks.\n4. Conduct user studies with clinicians, patients, measuring comprehension, trust, and decision satisfaction compared to standard LLM outputs.\n5. Iterate message design based on feedback.\n6. Benchmark communication effectiveness using metrics like comprehension tests, trust scores, and clinical decision alignment.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM recommends medication with risk of side effects.\nOutput: Layered summary that to clinician details drug efficacy stats, bias in training data, and uncertainty; for patient explains benefits/risks in simple language with graphics.\nExpected: Increased stakeholder understanding of risks, confidence in recommendation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multimedia explanations overwhelm users, test minimalistic textual warnings or voice-assisted summaries. Alternatively, personalize communication style using user profiling or AI-driven user feedback loops."

        "title": "Brain-Computer Interface Enhanced Interactive LLMs for Accessible, Bias-Aware Healthcare Decision Support",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM-powered healthcare tools struggle with accessibility, particularly for users with physical or cognitive impairments, and fail to incorporate user feedback seamlessly to reduce bias or misinterpretation in real-time.",
        "Motivation": "Leverages the novel cross-disciplinary hidden bridge linking brain-computer interfaces (BCI), human-computer interaction, and AI media studies to develop an unprecedented multimodal interactive healthcare decision support system. This approach addresses external gap by incorporating neurophysiological user feedback to adapt AI outputs towards fairness and comprehension in situ.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create an adaptive healthcare decision interface integrating EEG-based BCI sensors that capture user cognitive load, confusion, or emotional responses while interacting with LLM-generated outputs. These signals feed back into the LLM dialog manager, triggering real-time adaptation of explanations and bias mitigation strategies. The system combines AI, BCI signal processing, and multimedia communication to personalize and enhance fairness in decision support for more inclusive clinical environments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Recruit participants with accessibility needs.\n2. Assemble datasets combining healthcare decision tasks and user BCI recordings.\n3. Develop LLM with integrated BCI feedback control loops.\n4. Train multimodal fusion models linking BCI signals and AI explanation styles.\n5. Test adaptive system on simulated clinical scenarios comparing to static LLM assistance.\n6. Evaluate effectiveness via task performance, bias reduction, and user satisfaction metrics.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM suggests diagnostic options.\nUser shows cognitive overload signal via BCI.\nSystem detects this and switches to simpler explanation mode with additional bias disclaimers.\nExpected output: Reduced cognitive burden, increased trust, and clearer understanding leading to better decision outcomes.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If BCI signals are noisy or unreliable, incorporate alternative physiological signals (eye-tracking, heart rate) or explicit user feedback buttons. Alternatively, simulate BCI feedback with proxy signals during development."

        "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of standardized platforms to evaluate and understand the dynamics of bias and fairness in interactive human-AI healthcare decision teams, limiting development of effective co-operative systems that mitigate LLM bias.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the critical internal gap of missing integration between AI and communication research by creating an experimental simulator that models human-AI interaction with fairness constraints, inspired by multidisciplinary hidden bridges in human-AI teaming and risk communication. This approach enables systematic study and iterative improvement of bias mitigation through team dynamics.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-agent simulation platform where AI agents (LLMs) and human proxies (modeled from clinical communication data) interact in healthcare scenarios involving fairness-critical decisions. The system incorporates real-time bias injection and mitigation modules, communication strategy variations based on media studies, and dynamic trust modeling. Researchers can customize agent behaviors and communication models to test diverse strategies for bias-aware human-AI teaming.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect communication interaction datasets from healthcare teams.\n2. Implement AI and human proxy agents with behavioral models.\n3. Integrate bias modeling and mitigation components.\n4. Run simulations exploring parameter spaces of team compositions and communication protocols.\n5. Measure outcomes in terms of fairness, decision accuracy, communication effectiveness, and trust metrics.\n6. Validate simulator outputs against real-world clinical team performance when possible.",

        "title": "Multimodal Media-Infused Accountability Layer for Transparent AI Bias Disclosure in Healthcare",
        "Problem_Statement": "Healthcare LLM outputs rarely include explicit, understandable accountability information regarding bias and fairness, limiting ethical transparency and stakeholder trust.",
        "Motivation": "Combining media studies insights with AI interpretability tools addresses the internal gap of poor communication of bias and fairness. This project creates a novel accountability layer that transforms AI bias analytics into accessible multi-format media artifacts tailored to healthcare environments, an innovation informed by the hidden bridges between communication research and AI technology.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a middleware system that analyzes LLM outputs with bias quantification modules, then automatically generates multimodal media representations (infographics, narrative videos, interactive dialogues) explaining bias sources, impacts, and mitigation actions. These media artifacts are embedded directly into clinical decision workflows to enhance ethical transparency and stakeholder comprehension.",
