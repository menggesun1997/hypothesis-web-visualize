    "title": "Adaptive Hardware-in-the-Loop Recovery for Energy-Aware Scientific Mining",
    "Problem_Statement": "Recovery strategies for large language models in scientific literature mining often lack adaptive control that balances computational load and energy consumption in real-time deployments, causing inefficiencies and environmental costs.",
    "Motivation": "By leveraging the hidden bridge between 'hardware approach' and 'robotics research,' this proposal targets the internal gap of incomplete integration of hardware optimization with model efficiency, applying hardware-in-the-loop and supervisory control methods for dynamic, adaptive recovery in language model inference.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a hardware-in-the-loop feedback control system that monitors computational load, energy use, and model performance metrics during live literature mining. The system dynamically activates recovery modules—such as partial model re-initializations, selective layer re-computations, or lightweight fine-tuning—based on supervisory control policies optimized to minimize energy while preserving accuracy. The controller uses reinforcement learning to adapt control policies in operational environments.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Implement baseline scientific text mining language model.\n2. Integrate hardware monitoring tools (power sensors, utilization stats) in an emulated deployment environment.\n3. Develop recovery actions as adjustable module reinvocations.\n4. Train RL-based supervisory controller with multi-objective reward balancing energy and accuracy.\n5. Test on literature mining benchmarks with varying computational constraints.\n6. Measure gains in energy efficiency, recovery speed, and output quality.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A data stream of scientific abstracts requiring real-time entity extraction.\nExpected Output: Model invokes partial recovery only during peak loads, reducing energy usage by 25% compared to static recovery strategies, while maintaining extraction F1 above 90%.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If RL training is unstable, fallback to heuristic supervisory policies based on thresholding or rule-based triggers for recovery. Also explore offline training with simulated workload profiles to bootstrap the controller."
