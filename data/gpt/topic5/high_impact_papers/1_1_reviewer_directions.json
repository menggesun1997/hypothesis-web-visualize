    "title": "Risk-Communicated LLM Decision Summaries for Multi-stakeholder Healthcare Environments",
    "Problem_Statement": "Healthcare stakeholders (e.g., clinicians, patients, caregivers) often struggle to interpret LLM recommendations due to lack of transparency and nuanced communication about risk and bias, resulting in reduced trust and uptake of AI-driven decision support.",
    "Motivation": "Directly targets the critical gap related to communication effectiveness and trust by applying interdisciplinary risk communication theories to AI outputs. Novel synthesis of communication research with AI model interpretability advances addresses how to present fairness and bias information effectively to diverse healthcare audiences.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a modular decision summary generation framework that converts LLM outputs into layered, risk-communicated summaries tailored for different stakeholder groups. Incorporate message framing, uncertainty visualization, and bias disclosure based on risk communication principles. Combine natural language generation with graphic media elements to provide interactive, multimedia explanations of AI decisions, supporting informed decision-making in clinical workflows.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect diverse healthcare datasets with patient-clinician communication records.\n2. Train LLM decision models and develop bias/uncertainty quantification modules.\n3. Design interfacing communication modules applying risk communication frameworks.\n4. Conduct user studies with clinicians, patients, measuring comprehension, trust, and decision satisfaction compared to standard LLM outputs.\n5. Iterate message design based on feedback.\n6. Benchmark communication effectiveness using metrics like comprehension tests, trust scores, and clinical decision alignment.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM recommends medication with risk of side effects.\nOutput: Layered summary that to clinician details drug efficacy stats, bias in training data, and uncertainty; for patient explains benefits/risks in simple language with graphics.\nExpected: Increased stakeholder understanding of risks, confidence in recommendation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multimedia explanations overwhelm users, test minimalistic textual warnings or voice-assisted summaries. Alternatively, personalize communication style using user profiling or AI-driven user feedback loops."

          "feedback_content": "The experiment plan appears comprehensive but lacks explicit consideration of integration challenges within real clinical workflows and stakeholder diversity. Clarify how the collected datasets and user studies will represent the varied knowledge levels, cultural backgrounds, and decision-making roles of clinicians, patients, and caregivers to ensure feasibility and generalizability. Additionally, detail plans for iterative testing environments beyond lab settings, such as pilot deployments in ambulatory or hospital contexts to validate practical utility and adoption barriers effectively. This will strengthen empirical grounding and feasibility claims of the proposed method in complex healthcare settings where decision-making is distributed and context-dependent, enhancing the credibility and translational potential of the work. Consider also specifying metrics and protocols for assessing impact on actual clinical outcomes or workflow efficiency, not just comprehension and trust scores, to better demonstrate real-world efficacy and feasibility of adoption in healthcare systems.  \n\nIn summary, focus on augmenting the experimental plan with explicit multi-stakeholder representation, real-world testing scenarios, and outcome-oriented evaluation to robustly establish feasibility and scientific rigour of the proposed approach in real healthcare environments, beyond simulated user studies alone.  \n\nThis refinement is crucial given the complex sociotechnical nature of healthcare decision support and the diverse user groups targeted by the communication framework, ensuring the method can be responsibly and effectively deployed at scale in practice environments beyond initial prototypes or controlled experiments.  \n\nA stronger feasibility demonstration here will strongly support acceptance by clinical stakeholders and funding or deployment partners who require clear evidence of real-world impact and usability in their workflows and patient populations to move past theoretical or lab-based promise to practical adoption and benefit realization.  \n\nHence, please augment and clarify the scope, methods, and evaluation details in the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan accordingly to minimize deployment risks and maximize adoption potential early in the research lifecycle, creating a robust foundation for follow-up innovation and longitudinal impact studies that are critically needed in AI-driven healthcare decision support fields.  \n\nDetailed stakeholder profiling, iterative piloting, and mixed-method outcome evaluation must be explicitly integrated into the experimental plan for convincing proof of concept and clinical viability of the risk-communicated LLM summaries approach you propose.  \n\nThis focus on feasibility refinement should be prioritized as it underpins all claims of impact and soundness, balancing ambitious design with practical validation needs inherent in this high-stakes clinical AI context.  \n\nHope this guidance helps sharpen your experimental design into a compelling roadmap that meets rigorous peer expectations and real-world demands simultaneously.

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the broad existing literature linking interpretability, risk communication, and decision support in healthcare AI, a concrete way to enhance novelty and impact is to explicitly integrate sensor-based human activity recognition data and clinical documentation into the decision summaries as contextual evidence. For example, incorporating wearable sensor-derived patient activity or physiological data signals can enrich LLM decision explanations and risk communication with real-time objective health status indicators, enabling more personalized and temporally relevant risk framing tailored to patients’ current condition. \n\nConcretely, this integration would draw on global health system research around 'wearable sensor data', 'human activity recognition', and 'clinical documentation' to not just communicate AI model output risk and bias abstractly, but ground them in rich multimodal patient context dynamically captured in daily living and clinical settings, increasing explanatory power and stakeholder trust.  \n\nThis multimodal fusion can power advanced communication interfaces combining LLM natural language with intuitive visualizations of sensor trends and clinical note excerpts highlighting pertinent risks and uncertainties from recent patient behavior or status changes, going beyond static or generic summaries.  \n\nSuch an approach would leverage learning techniques from sensor-based activity recognition research and evaluation metrics established in clinical AI, bridging the gap between AI interpretability, real-world patient monitoring, and enriched stakeholder communication. This would improve clinical decision alignment, safety, and patient empowerment through truly context-aware, trustworthy AI explanations in healthcare environments, markedly advancing state of the art and impact.  \n\nTherefore, I strongly suggest revisiting your framework design to incorporate wearable sensor and activity data integration alongside existing LLM outputs and risk communication methods, positioning your work at the forefront of personalized, multimodal AI decision support research for healthcare stakeholders.  \n\nThis direction could substantially elevate your proposal’s novelty, competitive edge, and ultimate utility in complex, data-rich clinical environments where multiple stakeholders collaborate on care, perfectly aligned with the globally linked concepts you have listed. \n\nLooking forward to seeing how this integration can push your innovative decision summary communication approach to new heights in healthcare AI impact.  \n\nThank you!  \n-\nReviewer 1 (Area Chair)"
