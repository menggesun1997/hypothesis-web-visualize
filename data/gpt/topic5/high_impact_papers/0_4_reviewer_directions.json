    "title": "Multi-Professional Real-Time Collaboration Protocol for Mitigating Hallucination in Financial AI Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current AI financial advisory outputs are often disseminated without simultaneous expert validation, resulting in unchecked hallucination risks and misinformation propagation in critical decision-making.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by health informatics multi-professional real-time collaboration, this idea fills the gap of integrating real-time, cross-functional expert validation and communication within AI advisory platforms, a missing bridge in current practice.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop and integrate a real-time collaboration protocol leveraging multi-agent systems where financial analysts, compliance officers, and AI systems interact synchronously during advisory generation. The protocol defines communication channels, roles, and automated arbitration rules to identify and resolve hallucinations before user delivery, embedding robust information security and privacy controls from health systems.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Model existing financial advisory workflows and identify key professional roles. 2) Implement communication and collaboration modules simulating expert involvement in AI output validation. 3) Integrate privacy-preserving encryption and access controls adopted from health informatics. 4) Test with simulated advisory sessions involving LLMs generating recommendations, measuring hallucination incidence before and after protocol adoption.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: AI generates a complex portfolio suggestion with uncertain data points. Output: Compliance and financial experts receive alerts, collaborate in real-time to verify/refute hallucinated info, and finalize the advisory output collaboratively, increasing reliability.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time collaboration proves operationally infeasible, explore asynchronous multi-professional review systems with rapid feedback loops and advanced notification mechanisms."

Consider elaborating on specific metrics for collaboration effectiveness beyond hallucination reduction, and detail validation methods for privacy controls implementation within financial regulations. Additionally, the fallback asynchronous plan needs more concrete pathways for integration into existing workflows to ensure practical feasibility under operational constraints rather than a broad contingency statement only. Strengthening this experimental rigor is crucial to demonstrate practicability and scalability within target domains rather than a conceptual prototype phase alone. This will increase confidence that the method can transition from simulated to real-world environments effectively and lawfully. Target Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan."

          "feedback_content": "To address the high competitiveness and increase both novelty and impact, integrate concepts from clinical decision support systems and patient safety frameworks. For example, by adopting mature alert escalation protocols and error reduction strategies from emergency department workflows, the collaboration protocol can embed layered expert validation and fail-safe mechanisms tailored for financial AI hallucination risk mitigation. This cross-domain transfer could also inspire adaptive role delegation akin to clinical teams treating remitted MDD or mild cognitive impairment, where cognitive remediation parallels could guide collaborative strategies for inconsistent AI outputs. Expanding into these globally linked concepts enhances both robustness and the broader applicability of your system, potentially pushing it toward a novel interdisciplinary paradigm that transcends conventional financial AI advisory approaches.
