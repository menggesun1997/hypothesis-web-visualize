    "Problem_Statement": "Current AI financial advisory outputs are often disseminated without simultaneous expert validation, resulting in unchecked hallucination risks and misinformation propagation in critical decision-making.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by health informatics multi-professional real-time collaboration, this idea fills the gap of integrating real-time, cross-functional expert validation and communication within AI advisory platforms, a missing bridge in current practice.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop and integrate a real-time collaboration protocol leveraging multi-agent systems where financial analysts, compliance officers, and AI systems interact synchronously during advisory generation. The protocol defines communication channels, roles, and automated arbitration rules to identify and resolve hallucinations before user delivery, embedding robust information security and privacy controls from health systems.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Model existing financial advisory workflows and identify key professional roles. 2) Implement communication and collaboration modules simulating expert involvement in AI output validation. 3) Integrate privacy-preserving encryption and access controls adopted from health informatics. 4) Test with simulated advisory sessions involving LLMs generating recommendations, measuring hallucination incidence before and after protocol adoption.",

        "title": "Adaptive Multi-Professional Real-Time Collaboration Protocol Inspired by Clinical Decision Support for Mitigating Hallucination in Financial AI Systems",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current AI-driven financial advisory systems often produce hallucinated outputs that go unverified before dissemination, risking misinformation in critical financial decisions. Existing workflows lack integrated, real-time multi-expert validation frameworks that ensure accuracy while accommodating operational constraints such as latency, expert availability, and regulatory privacy requirements.",
        "Motivation": "While real-time multi-professional collaboration exists in domains like health informatics, financial AI advisory systems remain underexplored in this regard, leading to a gap between technological capabilities and trustworthy deployment. To overcome the NOV-COMPETITIVE status of conventional approaches, this work introduces an innovative, cross-domain-inspired protocol that adopts proven clinical decision support system (CDSS) error reduction, alert escalation frameworks, and patient safety paradigms, tailoring them to financial AI hallucination mitigation. This interdisciplinary integration significantly enhances the robustness, regulatory compliance, and operational scalability of AI advisory validation, advancing beyond current prototypes towards deployable solutions.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an adaptive multi-agent real-time collaboration protocol embedding mature clinical decision support system concepts, including layered alert escalation, fail-safe redundancies, and adaptive role delegation analogous to clinical teams managing complex cases such as remitted major depressive disorder (MDD) and mild cognitive impairment. The protocol enables financial analysts, compliance officers, and AI agents to interact synchronously through defined communication channels with arbitration mechanisms inspired by emergency department workflows for critical error handling. Key features include: (1) a tiered validation process that escalates AI hallucination alerts progressively among experts based on severity and confidence thresholds, (2) adaptive allocation of expert roles modulated by workload and expertise akin to cognitive remediation strategies, (3) integration of privacy-preserving cryptographic controls fully aligned with financial regulations (e.g., GDPR, SEC rules) leveraging lessons from patient safety frameworks, and (4) continuous system monitoring for synchronization overhead and latency with dynamic adjustment to minimize operational impact. This cross-domain methodology fosters a novel interdisciplinary paradigm transcending conventional financial AI advisory validation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Model and map current financial advisory workflows, identifying professional roles, decision points, and regulatory requirements. 2) Develop the multi-agent collaboration protocol integrating clinical decision support features with adaptive role delegation; implement layered alert escalation and fail-safe arbitration. 3) Integrate advanced privacy-preserving techniques including encrypted communications and strict access controls validated against specific financial compliance standards. 4) Design quantitative metrics for collaboration effectiveness, including (a) hallucination reduction rate, (b) synchronization latency, (c) collaboration overhead (time and resource utilization), (d) expert availability and engagement rates, and (e) adherence to privacy protocols measured by simulated penetration and leakage tests. 5) Conduct extensive simulated advisory sessions with LLM-generated recommendations and multi-expert interactions, logging all metrics to validate system efficacy and scalability. 6) Pilot asynchronous fallback integration with rapid notification mechanisms embedded into existing financial workflows, with measured feedback loop times and compliance audits to ensure operational feasibility. 7) Perform iterative optimization based on empirical data to align system with real-world constraints and regulatory frameworks.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An AI-generated complex portfolio recommendation containing uncertain or incomplete market data triggers the system. Output: The protocol initiates a tiered alert to a financial analyst who flags suspicious elements; alerts escalate to a compliance officer if unresolved. Experts collaborate in real-time with adaptive communication channels adjusting to their availability, supported by embedded privacy-preserving encryption. The collaborative resolution refines or rejects hallucinated content before final advisory delivery, ensuring reliability. Additionally, in fallback asynchronous mode, rapid notifications are sent with defined response time targets and audit trails, ensuring practical deployment in constrained operational environments.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should the real-time collaboration model encounter insurmountable operational constraints such as expert availability limitations or unacceptable synchronization latency, we will deploy a rigorously designed asynchronous multi-professional review system. This will incorporate advanced notification protocols with defined escalation paths and response time SLAs inspired by emergency department patient safety standards, ensuring rapid yet thorough validation without disrupting existing workflows. Integration will use compliant digital communication tools with embedded auditability for regulatory transparency. A pilot study will assess practical impact and scalability with continuous iteration to optimize balance between verification rigor and operational efficiency."

Consider elaborating on specific metrics for collaboration effectiveness beyond hallucination reduction, and detail validation methods for privacy controls implementation within financial regulations. Additionally, the fallback asynchronous plan needs more concrete pathways for integration into existing workflows to ensure practical feasibility under operational constraints rather than a broad contingency statement only. Strengthening this experimental rigor is crucial to demonstrate practicability and scalability within target domains rather than a conceptual prototype phase alone. This will increase confidence that the method can transition from simulated to real-world environments effectively and lawfully. Target Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan."

For example, by adopting mature alert escalation protocols and error reduction strategies from emergency department workflows, the collaboration protocol can embed layered expert validation and fail-safe mechanisms tailored for financial AI hallucination risk mitigation. This cross-domain transfer could also inspire adaptive role delegation akin to clinical teams treating remitted MDD or mild cognitive impairment, where cognitive remediation parallels could guide collaborative strategies for inconsistent AI outputs.
