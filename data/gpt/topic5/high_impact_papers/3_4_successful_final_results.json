    "Problem_Statement": "Balancing computational cost and prediction quality in language models during scientific literature mining remains challenging, with static precision levels often leading to unnecessary energy use or accuracy loss.",
    "Motivation": "Leveraging gaps in integrating hardware-software synergy and supervisory control from robotics, this project proposes dynamic adjustment of model precision (e.g., bit widths, layer widths) supervised by a control system based on workload and energy constraints to optimize tradeoffs adaptively.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive precision control framework where model components can operate at variable precision levels controlled by a real-time supervisory policy.

        "title": "Robust Supervisory Control for Dynamic Precision Scaling in Transformer Models Accelerated on FPGA for Energy-Quality Tradeoffs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Balancing computational cost and prediction quality in transformer language models applied to scientific literature mining remains challenging, with static precision levels often causing unnecessary energy consumption or accuracy loss. Existing dynamic precision methods lack well-defined control mechanisms to adapt seamlessly to fluctuating workloads without stability issues or latency overheads.",
        "Motivation": "Prior work on mixed-precision and adaptive inference either relies on heuristic adjustments or static profiles, limiting responsiveness and energy savings. This research introduces a rigorously defined supervisory control framework framed as a cyber-physical system that integrates hardware telemetry from FPGA/GPUs with model confidence and workload features in real-time. By embedding control-theoretic principles and self-adaptive decision-making into the precision scaling, the approach achieves intelligent, stable, and efficient precision adjustments surpassing conventional heuristics. This addresses the NOV-COMPETITIVE gap by combining self-adaptive architecture concepts and physical hardware interfacing to deliver a novel, robust, and practical solution for energy-quality tradeoffs in NLP workloads.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a supervisory control algorithm composed of three tightly coupled components forming a control loop: (1) Sensors: real-time hardware telemetry collected via FPGA/GPUs monitoring energy consumption, latency, and throughput metrics; (2) Controller: a mathematically formalized state-space model based on discrete-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) that inputs model confidence scores, workload characteristics (e.g. sentence complexity, entity density), and hardware telemetry to compute optimal precision configurations (bit widths and layer-wise precision) for upcoming inference batches; (3) Actuators: dynamic reconfiguration interfaces on transformer models leveraging FPGA-based self-adaptive architectures enabling rapid switching of precision levels with negligible latency overhead. The controller is designed with stability criteria ensuring avoidance of oscillations in precision settings via Lyapunov function-based guarantees and includes a latency penalty in the cost function to balance energy savings with throughput constraints. The supervisory policy executes in real time, achieving closed-loop control stability and enabling robust, intelligent decisions adapting to workload changes and energy budgets. Additionally, the method interfaces with mixed-precision kernels on GPUs and CSP-inspired cyber-physical architectural abstractions to generalize hardware-software collaboration.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select Transformer architectures with demonstrated precision scaling support such as DistilBERT and MobileBERT, referencing prior works (e.g., Q8BERT, HAQ).\n2. Implement hardware-in-the-loop monitoring utilizing FPGA boards (e.g., Xilinx Alveo U250) equipped with hardware counters and power sensors alongside GPU telemetry APIs to collect fine-grained energy and latency data.\n3. Develop the MPC-based supervisory control algorithm, validate its parameters through simulation, and deploy on the hardware platform integrating actuator interfaces enabling rapid precision reconfiguration.\n4. Evaluate on publicly available scientific literature mining datasets, such as SciERC for entity recognition and PubMed summarization datasets, measuring multiple metrics including F1, ROUGE, precision, recall, inference latency, and energy consumption.\n5. Quantify tradeoffs comparing dynamic precision scaling to static and mixed-precision baselines with ablation studies on control parameters and latency thresholds.\n6. Integrate fallback mechanisms—dynamic mixed-precision adaptation in layers and confidence-based early exit strategies—experimentally tested and folded into the supervisory control pipeline to ensure robustness.\n7. Timeline spans 18 months including hardware setup (3 months), algorithm development (5 months), integration (4 months), rigorous experimentation (4 months), and analysis/publication (2 months), addressing integration challenges such as API compatibility and control latency overheads.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: Batch of scientific paper abstracts with varying complexity and criticality.\nExpected Output: High critical abstracts processed at maximum bit-width precision ensuring at least 95% F1 score on entity recognition; lower critical abstracts assigned reduced bit-width precision yielding 20% overall energy savings without more than 2% accuracy degradation; inference times maintained within a 10% latency overhead threshold.\nValidation Metrics: Detailed energy profiling from FPGA/GPU telemetry, latency measurements, accuracy scores across multiple NLP tasks, and control stability confirmed via temporal analysis of precision adjustment trajectories.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full dynamic precision scaling adversely impacts prediction stability or induces excessive latency, fallback to a hybrid approach employing mixed-precision scaling only on selected transformer layers critical for accuracy, combined with confidence-based early exit mechanisms for computational savings. This fallback will be experimentally incorporated and its effectiveness rigorously quantified, ensuring continuous performance improvements. Furthermore, heuristic control policies will be evaluated as baseline comparators to validate the superiority of the MPC-based supervisory controller."

Specifically, how the supervisory policy integrates hardware telemetry, model confidence, and workload characteristics into a unified control signal is not sufficiently detailed. Clarify the control algorithm's framework, how it balances precision adjustments with latency and accuracy constraints, and how it ensures stability of the control loop during inference to avoid oscillations or suboptimal precision cycling. Including mathematical formulation or control-theoretic basis would strengthen soundness and reproducibility prospects of the method proposal within 'Proposed_Method'. This would also help clarify any assumptions about hardware/software interfacing and latency overheads induced by the control policy execution itself, both crucial for real-world feasibility and soundness of the approach.  This refinement is critical since the core novelty and performance hinge upon this supervisory control's robustness and adaptiveness within dynamic workloads and precision scaling contexts."

For example, the choice of specific transformer architectures capable of precision scaling should be justified with references or prior demonstrations. The hardware-in-the-loop monitoring system design needs elaboration: how hardware telemetry will be collected in real time, and whether accessible platforms or FPGA/GPUs will be used, impacting generalizability and reproducibility. Furthermore, the supervisory control algorithm development should include a validation methodology for tuning control parameters and measuring responsiveness versus accuracy/energy tradeoffs. The datasets chosen for scientific entity recognition and summarization should be specified with metrics beyond F1 score to capture nuanced quality degradation. Also, the fallback plan involving mixed precision or early exit strategies should be tested experimentally and integrated into the main pipeline to affirm robustness. Providing these experiment design details with timelines and possible integration challenges is essential to convincingly demonstrate feasibility in 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan'."
