    "title": "Hardware-Aware Knowledge Distillation Targeting Energy-Constrained Scientific Mining",
    "Problem_Statement": "Knowledge distillation from large LLMs to smaller models often ignores the underlying hardware energy profiles, leading to suboptimal efficiency in deployment on energy-constrained scientific mining platforms.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses internal gaps in hardware-software integration by incorporating hardware energy metrics directly into distillation objectives, creating models optimized for both accuracy and ecological footprint on target neuromorphic or edge platforms.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Propose a hardware-aware distillation framework where the student model learns not only task output distributions but also optimizes for a multi-objective loss including actual measured or simulated energy consumption on target hardware. Incorporate profiling tools within training loops to iteratively guide student model architecture search and parameter optimization for energy-efficient scientific mining tasks.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Profile candidate hardware platforms (neuromorphic chips, edge GPU).\n2. Set up teacher-student distillation pipelines with multi-objective losses.\n3. Apply to scientific text mining tasks (entity recognition, relation extraction).\n4. Evaluate distilled model performance, energy consumption, latency.\n5. Compare with standard distillation approaches ignoring hardware metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Scientific abstracts tagged with entities.\nExpected Output: Student model with 20% reduced energy consumption on target hardware maintaining >95% accuracy compared to teacher model.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct hardware-in-the-loop distillation is unstable, approximate energy costs via surrogate models or use multi-fidelity optimization methods to balance objectives separately before final distillation."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposal to jointly optimize accuracy and hardware energy consumption in knowledge distillation is compelling, the mechanism to integrate real-time hardware profiling within the training loop lacks detailed clarity. Specifically, how energy measurements will be captured efficiently without excessive latency or noise, how these hardware metrics are normalized or weighted alongside accuracy losses, and how the architecture search dynamically adapts to hardware feedback are not well elaborated. Providing a concrete algorithmic framework or pseudo-code describing the multi-objective loss construction, energy profiling integration, and iterative optimization methodology is essential to establish soundness and reproducibility of the approach, especially since hardware-in-the-loop training is non-trivial and can introduce stability and convergence challenges. Clarifying these mechanisms would greatly strengthen the technical validity and feasibility of the method proposed in the “Proposed_Method” section."

          "feedback_content": "To enhance both the novelty and impact of this work, it is recommended to integrate insights from globally linked concepts such as 'Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)' and 'self-supervised learning techniques.' Specifically, exploring hardware-aware distillation tailored for configurable FPGA platforms could allow flexible and fine-grained energy optimization, leveraging partial reconfiguration capabilities. Moreover, incorporating self-supervised pretraining for the student model might reduce reliance on labeled data and improve generalization under energy constraints. Additionally, integrating fast ML techniques or convolutional neural networks designed with energy profiles for edge GPUs or neuromorphic hardware could address broader classes of scientific mining tasks, expanding applicability beyond text mining. This would elevate the work from a competitive combination to a more interdisciplinary and impactful framework with stronger novelty and community interest."
