    "title": "Cognitive-AI Co-Mediation Framework for Bias Mitigation in Healthcare LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) in healthcare decision support often produce biased outputs due to data and model limitations, and these biases are poorly understood or communicated to healthcare professionals. There is no effective system that integrates unbiased human expertise and AI outputs through interactive communication to dynamically identify and mitigate such biases.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal and external gaps concerning the lack of integration between AI technological advances and communication, specifically bridging AI development with human-AI teaming frameworks. This novel approach leverages a human-AI co-mediation framework that combines human cognitive judgment with LLM outputs in a communicative loop to detect and mitigate bias dynamically.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an interactive AI system where healthcare professionals collaborate with an LLM through a structured dialogue interface. The system includes a bias detector module trained on known bias patterns, but critically, incorporates human-in-the-loop corrections that adapt model outputs via reinforcement learning from human feedback. Complementing this, an explanation communication layer translates model uncertainty and bias risk into intuitive visualizations and natural language alerts grounded in risk communication theories to enhance stakeholder understanding.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate a healthcare decision datasets with annotated bias instances (e.g., racial, gender bias).\n2. Build initial LLM models and train bias detectors.\n3. Develop the interactive communication interface embedding risk communication elements.\n4. Implement human-in-the-loop learning to dynamically update bias mitigation.\n5. Evaluate on real-world healthcare cases measuring bias reduction, user trust (via surveys), and decision accuracy compared to static LLM baselines.\n6. Conduct ablation studies to analyze contributions of communication interface and human feedback modules.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient description including minority ethnicity and symptoms.\nLLM output (biased): Treatment plan ignoring minority-specific complications.\nAfter human-AI co-mediation: System flags potential bias, provides explanation, healthcare professional iteratively adjusts plan with AI support resulting in a tailored, equitable treatment recommendation.\nExpected output: Transparent, bias-mitigated recommendation with documented rationale.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If human-in-the-loop adjustments are insufficient, investigate alternative bias detectors with multimodal inputs (e.g., medical images). If communication interface is ineffective, incorporate personalized user profiling to tailor message complexity and modality."

        "title": "Cognitive-AI Co-Mediation Framework with Cognitive Security and Responsible AI for Bias Mitigation in Healthcare LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) deployed in healthcare decision support often generate biased outputs stemming from data limitations, model assumptions, and unanticipated interactions within complex clinical contexts. These biases, such as those related to race, gender, or socioeconomic factors, are insufficiently quantified, explained, or communicated to healthcare professionals, which may perpetuate health disparities and diminish trust. Furthermore, current systems inadequately integrate rigorous bias measurement, dynamic human-AI collaboration, and safeguards to prevent harmful feedback loops or adversarial exploitation in interactive settings, impeding safe and effective bias mitigation in real-world healthcare.",
        "Motivation": "Although bias mitigation in healthcare LLMs has been extensively studied, existing approaches often focus on static model adjustments with limited human-AI teaming and lack comprehensive measurement and communication tailored to clinical users. Our framework innovatively synthesizes human-AI co-mediation with principles from cognitive security and Responsible AI to establish a holistic, trustworthy bias mitigation system. By embedding cognitive security safeguards, adaptive instructional communication, and systematic bias auditing, we address competitive research gaps related to practical deployment, human factors, and safety in complex healthcare environments. This cross-disciplinary approach enhances novelty by combining state-of-the-art AI bias detection with interaction design and safety management frameworks to better support clinicians' decision-making and equitable patient outcomes.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an interactive co-mediation system where healthcare professionals engage with LLM outputs through a structured, theory-driven dialogue interface grounded in human-computer interaction theory and adaptive instructional systems. The system integrates: (1) advanced bias detectors employing statistical fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity difference, equal opportunity difference) validated on diverse, representative large-scale healthcare datasets encompassing multiple bias types; (2) a cognitive security module that monitors for adversarial biases or feedback instabilities, employing anomaly detection and controlled reinforcement learning update schedules to ensure model robustness and safety; (3) human-in-the-loop mechanisms where expert feedback dynamically refines bias mitigation via carefully managed reinforcement learning, with explicit protocols to prevent adverse feedback cycles; (4) an explanation communication layer that adapts message complexity and modality using cognitive science and instructional design to enhance user trust, understanding, and engagement in line with Responsible AI auditing standards. The framework also includes systematic bias auditing and reporting modules for continuous transparency and regulatory compliance.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate and integrate multiple large-scale, clinically diverse healthcare datasets with explicit annotation of key bias dimensions (race, gender, age, socioeconomic status) ensuring representativeness and statistical power.\n2. Define and compute rigorous quantitative bias metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds, calibration error) and introduce statistical testing regimes (e.g., bootstrap confidence intervals, hypothesis testing) to validate bias measurement reliability.\n3. Develop initial LLM models and train bias detector modules calibrated against the defined fairness metrics.\n4. Design and implement a human-computer interface grounded in HCI theories and adaptive instructional systems, tailoring explanation delivery to usersâ€™ cognitive profiles.\n5. Integrate a cognitive security component that monitors reinforcement learning updates with safeguards (e.g., update frequency limits, anomaly detection) to prevent model drift and adversarial exploitation.\n6. Pilot studies with healthcare professionals to explore interaction patterns, refine human-in-the-loop scheduling, and validate communication efficacy.\n7. Full-scale deployment to evaluate bias mitigation effectiveness through quantitative bias reduction, decision accuracy, user trust surveys, and system stability metrics compared to baseline static LLMs.\n8. Conduct ablation studies isolating the effects of the communication interface, cognitive security safeguards, and human feedback modules.\n9. Implement systematic bias auditing and reporting aligned with Responsible AI frameworks, assessing social impact and regulatory compliance.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient case including minority ethnicity, gender, age, and complex symptomatology.\nInitial LLM output (biased): Treatment plan failing to account for population-specific risk factors or showing disparities in recommendations.\nCo-mediation interaction: System flags detected biases with quantified metrics and cognitive security alerts, presents explanations tailored to clinician's expertise, and suggests alternative considerations.\nHealthcare professional iteratively provides feedback correcting identified biases via the interface, triggering controlled reinforcement learning updates.\nExpected output: Refined, bias-mitigated, transparent treatment recommendation with documented fairness audit trail, improved clinical appropriateness, and enhanced user trust and understanding.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning introduces instability or insufficient bias mitigation, fallback includes limiting online updates using batch retraining and deploying more robust bias detectors with multimodal inputs (e.g., integrating medical imaging and EHR data). If the communication interface does not sufficiently enhance cognitive engagement, implement personalized user profiling to further tailor instructional content and modality (visual, textual, interactive). Additionally, incorporate external Responsible AI audit tools to reinforce systematic bias detection and reporting."

          "feedback_content": "While the step-by-step experiment plan is thorough in terms of system building and evaluation, it lacks detail on how biases will be quantitatively measured and validated beyond user trust and decision accuracy. To ensure feasibility and rigorous validation, specify concrete bias metrics (e.g., disparity indices, fairness metrics) and statistical testing protocols. Additionally, clarify the scale and diversity of healthcare datasets to confirm representativeness for bias types targeted. This will strengthen the scientific soundness and replicability of the evaluation framework, a critical aspect for deployment in sensitive healthcare settings involving human-AI co-mediation loops with reinforcement learning components, where uncontrolled feedback loops can introduce risks or instabilities otherwise overlooked in the plan's current form. Finally, more details on managing and scheduling human-in-the-loop interventions and how reinforcement learning updates interface with model stability would enhance feasibility confidence for this complex system. Targeted pilot studies exploring interaction patterns could precede full scale experiments to mitigate these risks early on, which should be incorporated explicitly in the plan to improve feasibility and credibility in real-world healthcare AI applications.

For example, explicitly embedding cognitive security principles could provide a novel angle safeguarding against adversarial or unintended model biases, while tailoring the explanation communication layer through adaptive instructional systems could enhance human cognitive engagement and trust. Harnessing frameworks from Responsible AI to systematically audit and report biases within this co-mediation loop could raise the framework's broader societal relevance and acceptance. Finally, grounding the interface and human-AI teaming design in established human-computer interaction theories can improve usability and foster adoption by healthcare professionals, potentially increasing impact and novelty beyond current state-of-the-art approaches. Emphasize these cross-disciplinary integrations in the proposal to strengthen global relevance and provide a clearer path for practical deployment and future extension.
