BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics', 'abstract': 'Proudly serving the scientific community for over a century, this 97th edition of the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics is an update of a classic reference, mirroring the growth and direction of science. This venerable work continues to be the most accessed and respected scientific reference in the world. An authoritative resource consisting of tables of data and current international recommendations on nomenclature, symbols, and units, its usefulness spans not only the physical sciences but also related areas of biology, geology, and environmental science.

This reference puts physical property data and mathematical formulas used in labs and classrooms every day within easy reach.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': '“So what if ChatGPT wrote it?” Multidisciplinary perspectives on opportunities, challenges and implications of generative conversational AI for research, practice and policy', 'abstract': 'Transformative artificially intelligent tools, such as ChatGPT, designed to generate sophisticated text indistinguishable from that produced by a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI', 'abstract': 'In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Supervised Sequence Labelling with Recurrent Neural Networks', 'abstract': 'Supervised sequence labelling is a vital area of machine learning, encompassing tasks such as speech, handwriting and gesture recognition, protein secondary structure prediction and part-of-speech tagging. Recurrent neural networks are powerful sequence learning tools—robust to input noise and distortion, able to exploit long-range contextual information—that would seem ideally suited to such problems. However their role in large-scale sequence labelling systems has so far been auxiliary.\\xa0 \\xa0 The goal of this book is a complete framework for classifying and transcribing sequential data with recurrent neural networks only. Three main innovations are introduced in order to realise this goal.\\xa0Firstly, the connectionist temporal classification output layer allows the framework to be trained with unsegmented target sequences, such as phoneme-level speech transcriptions; this is in contrast to previous connectionist approaches, which were dependent on error-prone prior segmentation. Secondly, multidimensional recurrent neural networks extend the framework in a natural way to data with more than one spatio-temporal dimension, such as images and videos. Thirdly, the use of hierarchical subsampling makes it feasible to apply the framework to very large or high resolution sequences, such as raw audio or video. \\xa0 Experimental validation is provided by state-of-the-art results in speech and handwriting recognition.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Automated Solution of Differential Equations by the Finite Element Method, The FEniCS Book', 'abstract': 'This book is written by researchers and developers behind the FEniCS Project and explores an advanced, expressive approach to the development of mathematical software. The presentation spans mathematical background, software design and the use of FEniCS in applications.

With the technological development of deep learning-based high-precision recognition models and natural generation models, Metaverse is being strengthened with various factors, from mobile-based always-on access to connectivity with reality using virtual currency. The integration of enhanced social activities and neural-net methods requires a new definition of Metaverse suitable for the present, different from the previous Metaverse. This paper divides the concepts and essential techniques necessary for realizing the Metaverse into three components (i.e., hardware, software, and contents) and three approaches (i.e., user interaction, implementation, and application) rather than marketing or hardware approach to conduct a comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, we describe essential methods based on three components and techniques to Metaverse’s representative Ready Player One, Roblox, and Facebook research in the domain of films, games, and studies. Finally, we summarize the limitations and directions for implementing the immersive Metaverse as social influences, constraints, and open challenges.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Building Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models on Google Cloud Platform, A Comprehensive Guide for Beginners', 'abstract': 'Take a systematic approach to understanding the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning from the ground up and how they are applied in practice.

It makes a major contribution because it profoundly destabilizes the scholarship on globalization, the so-called new economy, information technology, distinct contemporary business cultures and practices\\' - Saskia Sassen, author of Globalization and its Discontents `Nigel Thrift offers us the sort of cultural analysis of global capitalism that has long been needed - one that emphasizes the innovative energy of global capitalism. The book avoids stale denouncements and offers instead a view of capitalism as a form of practice\\' - Karin Knorr Cetina, Professor of Sociology, University of Konstanz, GermanyCapitalism is well known for producing a form of existence where `everything solid melts into air\\'. But what happens when capitalism develops theories about itself? Are we moving into a condition in which capitalism can be said to possess a brain?These questions are pursued in this sparkling and thought-provoking book. Thrift looks at what he calls \"the cultural circuit of capitalism,\" the mechanism for generating new theories of capitalism. The book traces the rise of this circuit back to the 1960s when a series of institutions locked together to interrogate capitalism, to the present day, when these institutions are moving out to the Pacific basin and beyond. What have these theories produced? How have they been implicated in the speculative bubbles that characterized the late twentieth century? What part have they played in developing our understanding of human relations?Building on an inter-disciplinary approach which embraces the core social sciences, Thrift outlines an exciting new theory for understanding capitalism. His book is of interest to readers in Geography, Social Theory, Antrhopology and Cultural Economics.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Handbook of Adhesion Technology', 'abstract': 'Adhesives have been used for thousands of years, but until 100 years ago, the vast majority was from natural products such as bones, skins, fish, milk, and plants. Since about 1900, adhesives based on synthetic polymers have been introduced, and today, there are many industrial uses of adhesives and sealants. It is difficult to imagine a product—in the home, in industry, in transportation, or anywhere else for that matter—that does not use adhesives or sealants in some manner. The Handbook of Adhesion Technology is intended to be the definitive reference in the field of adhesion. Essential information is provided for all those concerned with the adhesion phenomenon. Adhesion is a phenomenon of interest in diverse scientific disciplines and of importance in a wide range of technologies. Therefore, this handbook includes the background science (physics, chemistry and materials science), engineering aspects of adhesion and industry specific applications. It is arranged in a user-friendly format with ten main sections: theory of adhesion, surface treatments, adhesive and sealant materials, testing of adhesive properties, joint design, durability, manufacture, quality control, applications and emerging areas. Each section contains about five chapters written by internationally renowned authors who are authorities in their fields. This book is intended to be a reference for people needing a quick, but authoritative, description of topics in the field of adhesion and the practical use of adhesives and sealants. Scientists and engineers of many different backgrounds who need to have an understanding of various aspects of adhesion technology will find it highly valuable. These will include those working in research or design, as well as others involved with marketing services. Graduate students in materials, processes and manufacturing will also want to consult it.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "current_research_landscape": "The foundational literature reveals a research cluster centered on large pretrained language models (e.g., BERT, GPT series) mainly developed and benchmarked in English NLP tasks. Core concerns include both performance and ethical/legal challenges associated with scaling and transferring these models. Central nodes highlight \"language model,\" \"pretrained models,\" and \"English\" as dominant themes, reflecting a focus on adapting these models to specific domains.\n\nThe thematic islands underscore dual foci: one around language models and their NLP applications, the other surprisingly connected to foundational scientific references such as the \"Handbook of Chemistry,\" hinting at reliance on broad scientific datasets and cross-disciplinary data rigor for model development or evaluation. Dominant methodologies include fine-tuning pretrained models on domain-specific data, sequence labeling techniques using recurrent neural networks, and an increasing concern for model explainability (XAI) and ethical use questioning.\n\nOverall, the central problem tackled is how to adapt large pretrained language models, primarily trained on general English corpora, to the specialized and sensitive domain of legal document analysis, taking into account domain-shift failures that degrade model effectiveness and reliability.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: The literature and local concept network reveal a lack of bridge concepts linking language models explicitly with domain adaptation in fields outside general NLP benchmarks. No bridge nodes connect core NLP clusters with domain-specific scientific or regulatory knowledge bases, indicating a siloed understanding. Additionally, foundational papers note limitations in current fine-tuning approaches regarding biases, dataset curation, and lack of interpretability, particularly critical in legal contexts requiring transparency and accountability.\n\nExternal/Novel Gaps: The global GPS analysis surfaces a hidden bridge between 'language model' techniques and 'Handbook of Chemistry' concepts through cross-cutting domains such as knowledge graphs, polymer informatics, and structured database querying techniques (e.g., SQL). This reveals a promising, yet unexplored opportunity: integrating structured scientific data handling and rigorous symbolic representations from chemical informatics into language model adaptation workflows. Such cross-disciplinary approaches could strengthen adaptive calibration by embedding domain knowledge in a structured, queryable form to alleviate domain-shift issues and enhance interpretability/provenance in legal document analysis.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Develop an adaptive calibration framework that incorporates knowledge graph representations derived from structured domain ontologies (inspired by chemical informatics methods) to augment pretrained language models for legal texts, addressing domain-shift failures by embedding explicit symbolic legal knowledge.\n\nOpportunity 2: Leverage Structured Query Language (SQL) and database-driven approaches from scientific informatics to design fine-tuning pipelines that systematically query and filter domain-relevant legal data subsets, improving data curation, reducing biases, and enhancing model reliability in legal document analysis.\n\nOpportunity 3: Integrate explainable AI (XAI) paradigms with these structured knowledge-driven model adaptations to create transparent and accountable legal NLP systems, fulfilling ethical and policy requirements highlighted in foundational literature, while mitigating risks of misinterpretation from domain shifts."
