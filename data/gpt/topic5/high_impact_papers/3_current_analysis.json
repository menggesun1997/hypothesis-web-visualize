With the technological development of deep learning-based high-precision recognition models and natural generation models, Metaverse is being strengthened with various factors, from mobile-based always-on access to connectivity with reality using virtual currency. The integration of enhanced social activities and neural-net methods requires a new definition of Metaverse suitable for the present, different from the previous Metaverse. This paper divides the concepts and essential techniques necessary for realizing the Metaverse into three components (i.e., hardware, software, and contents) and three approaches (i.e., user interaction, implementation, and application) rather than marketing or hardware approach to conduct a comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, we describe essential methods based on three components and techniques to Metaverse’s representative Ready Player One, Roblox, and Facebook research in the domain of films, games, and studies. Finally, we summarize the limitations and directions for implementing the immersive Metaverse as social influences, constraints, and open challenges.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Neural Networks and Deep Learning, A Textbook', 'abstract': 'This book covers both classical and modern models in deep learning. The chapters of this book span three categories: The basics of neural networks: Many traditional machine learning models can be understood as special cases of neural networks. An emphasis is placed in the first two chapters on understanding the relationship between traditional machine learning and neural networks. Support vector machines, linear/logistic regression, singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, and recommender systems are shown to be special cases of neural networks. These methods are studied together with recent feature engineering methods like word2vec. Fundamentals of neural networks: A detailed discussion of training and regularization is provided in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapters 5 and 6 present radial-basis function (RBF) networks and restricted Boltzmann machines. Advanced topics in neural networks: Chapters 7 and8 discuss recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Several advanced topics like deep reinforcement learning, neural Turing machines, Kohonen self-organizing maps, and generative adversarial networks are introduced in Chapters 9 and 10. The book is written for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners. Numerous exercises are available along with a solution manual to aid in classroom teaching.

Reaching for the human frontier, robotics is vigorously engaged in the growing challenges of new emerging domains. Interacting, exploring, and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly touch people and their lives. The credible prospect of practical robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics as a modern scientific discipline. The ongoing vibrant expansion and strong growth of the field during the last decade has fueled this second edition of the Springer Handbook of Robotics. The first edition of the handbook soon became a landmark in robotics publishing and won the American Association of Publishers PROSE Award for Excellence in Physical Sciences & Mathematics as well as the organization’s Award for Engineering & Technology.

A limiting factor for a broader adoption of AI technology is the inherent risks that come with giving up human control and oversight to “intelligent” machines. Forsensitive tasks involving critical infrastructures and affecting human well-being or health, it is crucial to limit the possibility of improper, non-robust and unsafe decisions and actions. Before deploying an AI system, we see a strong need to validate its behavior, and thus establish guarantees that it will continue to perform as expected when deployed in a real-world environment. In pursuit of that objective, ways for humans to verify the agreement between the AI decision structure and their own ground-truth knowledge have been explored. Explainable AI (XAI) has developed as a subfield of AI, focused on exposing complex AI models to humans in a systematic and interpretable manner. The 22 chapters included in this book provide a timely snapshot of algorithms, theory, and applications of interpretable and explainable AI and AI techniques that have been proposed recently reflecting the current discourse in this field and providing directions of future development.

    "current_research_landscape": "The current research landscape is built upon foundational advances in neural networks and deep learning, with core focus on neural net methods, generative and recognition models, and associated hardware approaches as indicated by central nodes such as 'neural net method', 'generative model', and 'hardware approach.' The thematic islands reveal clusters centering on hardware-enabled deep learning techniques (including Facebook research using neural nets), robotics applications emphasizing practical deployment, and classical to advanced neural network methodologies as core paradigms. Foundational texts underpin concepts from deep learning architectures and training to large-scale data mining and knowledge discovery, reflecting the emphasis on computational techniques supporting scientific literature mining. Dominant methods include neural network architectures, hardware-software co-design approaches, and advanced data mining frameworks. The practical distribution and integration of models in hardware platforms and robotics signal an applied orientation, suggesting cross-cutting concerns with efficiency and real-world deployment.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite strong developments in neural network models and robotics systems, there is a noted limitation in integration between hardware optimization and software/model efficiency, particularly for large-scale language models in scientific domains. The bridge nodes like 'state-of-the-art' and 'advanced robotic applications' highlight opportunities but reveal that practical systems still face challenges in balancing computational costs, energy consumption, and model explainability. Moreover, existing literature indicates a lack of comprehensive explainability and transparency in deep models applied to complex scientific data, limiting their adoption in sensitive or critical scientific mining tasks. External/Novel Gaps: The global context analysis identifies hidden bridges such as the link between 'hardware approach' and 'robotics research' through neuromorphic hardware, human-robot interaction, and hardware-in-the-loop methodologies. Similarly, connections between 'hardware approach' and 'case of neural networks' point to emerging paradigms like spiking neural networks, deep neural network hardware acceleration, and learning-to-learn strategies that are absent from the local research cluster. These hidden bridges suggest that leveraging neuromorphic and edge computing platforms could dramatically reduce the computational and environmental footprint of large language models, a critical unexplored opportunity in current literature mining approaches. Additionally, robotics-derived concepts such as supervisory control and mobile edge computing platforms could inspire more efficient, adaptive deployment strategies for language model inference and recovery in distributed scientific data mining contexts.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate neuromorphic hardware and spiking neural network paradigms (from Global Bridge between 'hardware approach' and 'case of neural networks') with advanced neural net methods (local thematic island) to develop low-power, efficient language models tailored for scientific literature mining, addressing the computational and environmental cost limitations noted in the foundational literature.\n\nOpportunity 2: Apply hardware-in-the-loop and supervisory control techniques (from 'hardware approach' and 'robotics research' hidden bridge) to design adaptive, real-time recovery strategies for language models deployed in scientific mining platforms. This could optimize resource allocation dynamically, reducing unnecessary computation and environmental impact.\n\nOpportunity 3: Leverage mobile edge computing platforms and self-driving laboratory concepts (from global co-concepts linking hardware and robotics approaches) to distribute language model inference and retraining across decentralized scientific environments. This hybrid approach addresses internal gaps in scalability and energy consumption by bringing computation closer to data sources, aligning with the practical robot and state-of-the-art bridge nodes emphasizing real-world deployment and efficiency."
