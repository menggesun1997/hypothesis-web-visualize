    "title": "Ethical Competence Module for Socially Interactive LLM Agents",
    "Problem_Statement": "Autonomous customer service agents driven by LLMs cannot currently recover gracefully from adversarial failures due to lack of embedded ethical competence and social responsibility, reducing user trust and increasing risks in sensitive domains.",
    "Motivation": "Novel integration of ethical competence and social responsibility directly into LLM conversational behavior models—addressing the critical gap of insufficient recovery post-adversarial failure. Builds on the 'online translation' and 'socially interactive agents' bridge by enabling agents to exhibit reparative social interactions as a recovery mechanism.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an ethical competence module (ECM) layered on LLM behavior generation comprising: (1) An ethical knowledge graph aligned with domain norms and social responsibility; (2) A real-time ethical reasoning engine validating candidate responses; (3) Adversarial failure detector triggering reparative dialog strategies such as apology, clarification, or correction grounded in the ECM; (4) A response re-generator guided by ECM validation feedback to ensure socially appropriate recovery interactions.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct or curate datasets containing ethical dilemmas and reparative conversational examples. 2) Fine-tune large LLMs with augmented data reflecting ethical competence signals. 3) Implement adversarial attack scenarios simulating failures to test recovery responses. 4) Measure response appropriateness, user trust scores (via user simulation or human evaluation), and adversarial robustness against baselines without ECM. 5) Perform ablations on ECM components to validate contribution.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User queries agent with sensitive or ambiguous request, agent replies with initially wrong or offensive output due to adversarial input. Expected Output: Agent detects failure, issues a context-aware apology, clarifies user intent, corrects previous mistake, restoring trust and maintaining ethical behavior.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If explicit ethical reasoning slows response times or reduces language fluency, implement a lightweight flagging mechanism for post-response human review or delayed ethical refinement. Alternatively, integrate ethical fine-tuning as an implicit signal rather than explicit module."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines components such as an ethical knowledge graph and a real-time ethical reasoning engine; however, it lacks clarity on how these components will be technically integrated with the LLM's generation process without compromising fluency or response latency. Specifically, the mechanism for ethical validation and reparative dialog generation requires more detailed explication—how will the system balance ethical correctness with natural conversational flow, and how will conflicts between ECM validation and LLM outputs be resolved? Providing formal models or algorithmic frameworks would enhance soundness and reproducibility of the method, which is currently described at a conceptual level only, limiting confidence in its practical implementation and effectiveness potential. It is critical to elaborate and concretize these mechanisms before progressing to evaluation to ensure the approach is technically viable and can scale effectively under real-world constraints and adversarial conditions, particularly in sensitive domains requiring nuanced ethical judgment and social competence integration within LLM responses. This will also clarify assumptions about the nature of ethical reasoning automation and interaction with large pre-trained models, a foundational aspect of the research idea’s innovation and impact potential. The Innovator must address these mechanistic ambiguities first to establish a robust foundational method that is both interpretable and practical for the intended applications."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lays out a logical progression of dataset construction, fine-tuning, simulated adversarial testing, and evaluation. However, the plan currently under-specifies critical methodological details that impact feasibility and scientific rigor. For example, it lacks precise criteria or protocol descriptions for dataset curation to ensure representativeness and annotation quality of ethical dilemmas and reparative interactions. It also does not clarify the scale or choice of baseline models for comparative evaluation, nor how user trust scores will be reliably measured—whether through human raters, simulated users with validated behavioral models, or hybrid approaches—to ensure statistical significance and ecological validity. Furthermore, evaluation metrics beyond appropriateness and trust, such as latency, fluency degradation, and false positive recovery triggers, are important to assess trade-offs anticipated by the ethical reasoner integration. The ablation study plan is promising but requires specification of individual ECM component isolation and expected impact hypotheses. Addressing these points with rigorous experimental designs and strong evaluation protocols is essential for the project’s feasibility and to produce impactful, generalizable insights. Without these refinements, experimental outcomes risk being inconclusive or non-reproducible, impeding the demonstration of effectiveness and hindering community adoption."
