    "title": "SQL-Driven Data Curation Pipelines for Bias Mitigation in Legal Domain Fine-Tuning",
    "Problem_Statement": "Traditional fine-tuning pipelines for legal LLMs often fail to systematically curate domain-relevant datasets, resulting in biases and noise that aggravate domain-shift failures and reduce model reliability.",
    "Motivation": "Directly addresses the external gap identified, leveraging SQL and database querying techniques from chemical informatics to systematically query, filter, and select legal data subsets, systematically reducing bias and improving data quality for fine-tuning.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a fine-tuning data curation pipeline that treats legal corpora as structured databases, enabling SQL-based queries to extract balanced, representative, and ethically vetted data subsets for training. This method incorporates metadata, document provenance, and domain heuristics to create custom datasets that reduce skew and noise.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Convert legal document datasets into structured databases with appropriate schema encoding metadata and content indices. 2) Design SQL queries to extract balanced data slices focusing on jurisdiction, topic, and source diversity. 3) Fine-tune language models on curated datasets and benchmark against models trained on raw unfiltered data. 4) Evaluate for accuracy, fairness/bias metrics, and reliability on downstream legal NLP tasks.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Query requesting documents from diverse jurisdictions covering contract law and employment law. Output: Curated data subset including balanced representation from specified domains and jurisdictions for subsequent model fine-tuning, resulting in improved performance and fairness.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If direct SQL-based curation proves limited, fallback to embedding-based similarity filtering combined with metadata heuristics or incorporate semi-supervised active learning to iteratively refine the dataset."

There is also no mention of practicality challenges such as the scalability of converting large legal corpora into databases with appropriate schema or handling noisy or inconsistent metadata. To improve feasibility, it is recommended to include preliminary feasibility analyses of dataset structuring, rigorous validation protocols for the SQL-based curation, and contingency strategies for schema evolution or incomplete metadata. Clear success criteria for bias reduction in the curated subsets should also be defined upfront to assess effectiveness beyond standard accuracy metrics, possibly integrating fairness measurement methodologies tailored to legal NLP datasets and tasks. This will strengthen confidence in successful real-world deployment of the pipeline and demonstrate experimental rigor necessary for conference-level acceptance, especially in a competitive area such as legal NLP bias mitigation pipelines.

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty rating as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the focused domain on legal LLM fine-tuning data curation, consider augmenting the pipeline with privacy attack detection or robust fairness auditing modules inspired by concepts like 'privacy challenges', 'privacy attacks', and 'detection system' from the globally-linked concepts list. Incorporating adversarial approaches or privacy threat simulations on the curated datasets could yield richer evaluations, improving novelty and impact. Moreover, integrating multi-turn interactions evaluation or downstream tasks representing real-world legal conversations could broaden applicability and attractiveness. Exploring semi-supervised active learning or embedding-based similarity, as fallback hints, could also connect to recent advances in 'training deep learning models' and 'natural language processing tasks', potentially leading to hybrid curation strategies that improve robustness and set this work apart in impact and technical depth.
