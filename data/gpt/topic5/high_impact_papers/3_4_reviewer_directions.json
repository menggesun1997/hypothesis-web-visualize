    "title": "Dynamic Supervisory Control of Model Precision for Energy-Quality Tradeoffs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Balancing computational cost and prediction quality in language models during scientific literature mining remains challenging, with static precision levels often leading to unnecessary energy use or accuracy loss.",
    "Motivation": "Leveraging gaps in integrating hardware-software synergy and supervisory control from robotics, this project proposes dynamic adjustment of model precision (e.g., bit widths, layer widths) supervised by a control system based on workload and energy constraints to optimize tradeoffs adaptively.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive precision control framework where model components can operate at variable precision levels controlled by a real-time supervisory policy. This policy, informed by hardware telemetry, model confidence, and workload characteristics, dynamically scales precision up or down to conserve energy while maintaining required quality thresholds in literature mining tasks.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select transformer-based models capable of precision scaling.\n2. Implement hardware-in-the-loop monitoring system.\n3. Develop supervisory control algorithm using model confidence scores and energy budgets.\n4. Train and test on scientific entity recognition and summarization datasets.\n5. Quantify savings in energy versus accuracy tradeoffs relative to static precision baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A batch of scientific paper abstracts.\nExpected Output: Critical abstracts processed at high precision ensuring 95% F1 score, less critical ones at lower precision saving 20% energy overall without meaningful accuracy degradation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If model precision scaling is too disruptive to accuracy, fallback to mixed-precision where only certain layers adapt. Alternatively, use confidence-based early exits for computational savings."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method's dynamic adjustment of model precision based on supervisory control is promising but lacks clarity on the exact mechanism for decision-making. Specifically, how the supervisory policy integrates hardware telemetry, model confidence, and workload characteristics into a unified control signal is not sufficiently detailed. Clarify the control algorithm's framework, how it balances precision adjustments with latency and accuracy constraints, and how it ensures stability of the control loop during inference to avoid oscillations or suboptimal precision cycling. Including mathematical formulation or control-theoretic basis would strengthen soundness and reproducibility prospects of the method proposal within 'Proposed_Method'. This would also help clarify any assumptions about hardware/software interfacing and latency overheads induced by the control policy execution itself, both crucial for real-world feasibility and soundness of the approach.  This refinement is critical since the core novelty and performance hinge upon this supervisory control's robustness and adaptiveness within dynamic workloads and precision scaling contexts."

          "feedback_content": "While the experiment plan is logically structured, it requires more concrete operational details to bolster feasibility. For example, the choice of specific transformer architectures capable of precision scaling should be justified with references or prior demonstrations. The hardware-in-the-loop monitoring system design needs elaboration: how hardware telemetry will be collected in real time, and whether accessible platforms or FPGA/GPUs will be used, impacting generalizability and reproducibility. Furthermore, the supervisory control algorithm development should include a validation methodology for tuning control parameters and measuring responsiveness versus accuracy/energy tradeoffs. The datasets chosen for scientific entity recognition and summarization should be specified with metrics beyond F1 score to capture nuanced quality degradation. Also, the fallback plan involving mixed precision or early exit strategies should be tested experimentally and integrated into the main pipeline to affirm robustness. Providing these experiment design details with timelines and possible integration challenges is essential to convincingly demonstrate feasibility in 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan'."
