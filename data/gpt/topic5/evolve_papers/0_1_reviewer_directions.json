    "title": "ESG-Augmented Financial LLM with Sustainability Fact-Checker",
    "Problem_Statement": "Financial LLMs rarely incorporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics, leading to advisory outputs that overlook sustainability risks and misinform investors focused on responsible investment.",
    "Motivation": "This idea exploits the external gap of integrating ESG and non-financial metrics into financial LLM advisory systems, pioneering a novel model architecture that fuses conventional financial data and dynamic ESG indicators to enhance output accuracy and trustworthiness.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a dual-stream neural architecture where one stream processes traditional financial data and the other ingests ESG datasets (e.g., real-time carbon footprint, labor practices). A specialized cross-attention mechanism reconciles these streams to inform investment advice. An ESG fact-checking module validates claims against a live sustainability database to detect misinformation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect paired financial and ESG datasets; 2) Train baseline financial LLM and ESG-augmented LLM; 3) Evaluate advice quality using financial return accuracy and ESG consistency metrics; 4) Conduct case studies illustrating ESG influence on advice; 5) Measure user trust and decision-making improvements.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Recommend companies with strong financial growth and low environmental impact.' Expect advice highlighting firms with verified ESG scores alongside financial growth, with ESG claims fact-checked for accuracy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If integration degrades financial prediction accuracy, iteratively adjust weighting in dual-stream model or use modular gating to selectively incorporate ESG data only when confidence is high."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that combining ESG data streams directly with traditional financial data via a dual-stream architecture and cross-attention will reliably enhance investment advice accuracy and trustworthiness. However, the heterogeneity, noise, and temporal dynamics of ESG data compared to financial metrics can challenge this integration. Clarify and justify assumptions about data compatibility, alignment, and the ability of the model to effectively reconcile these divergent streams without degrading financial prediction quality. Providing preliminary analysis or evidence supporting these assumptions will strengthen soundness and mitigate risks of model underperformance or misleading outputs due to ESG data integration complexities or inconsistencies in real-time fact-checking databases.\n\nAdditionally, clearly articulate assumptions underpinning the ESG fact-checker's effectiveness, including the availability, reliability, and comprehensiveness of live sustainability databases that can provide real-time verification at the granularity needed for investment advice contexts. Without strong foundational assumptions here, the mechanism risks being overly idealistic or infeasible in practice, reducing overall soundness and trust in the system's outputs.\n\nHence, the innovator must explicitly enumerate and critically assess these core assumptions to reinforce the idea's technical and conceptual soundness prior to proceeding with experimental validation or deployment stages. This may include pilot data analyses or benchmarking the fact-checking module's precision against domain-specific ESG claims datasets if available.  \n\n(Section targeted: Problem_Statement, Proposed_Method)  \n(SOU-ASSUMPTION)  "

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is a solid starting framework but lacks critical details necessary to affirm feasibility. The plan should elaborate on how ESG and financial datasets will be distinctly sourced, curated, synchronized, and preprocessed to ensure temporal and contextual alignment essential for coherent model training. Methodologies for evaluating \"financial return accuracy\" and \"ESG consistency metrics\" need definition, including benchmark datasets or industry standards, evaluation protocols, and quantitative thresholds that will signal model improvement or regression.\n\nMoreover, the plan does not explicitly address potential confounding factors, such as data sparsity in ESG metrics, model overfitting to noisy ESG signals, or the computational complexity and resource demands of the dual-stream architecture combined with a live fact-checking module. It should propose fallback or mitigation strategies beyond simple weighting adjustments, such as ablation studies, robustness evaluations under varying data quality, or inclusion of human expert review in later stages.\n\nDetailed measurement approaches for \"user trust and decision-making improvements,\" including user study design, sample sizes, survey instruments, or behavioral analytics, should be articulated to substantiate claims of enhanced trustworthiness realistically.\n\nProviding a more thorough, methodical, and resource-aware experiment plan will markedly improve the feasibility assessment and increase chances of replicable, impactful outcomes.\n\n(Section targeted: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)  \n(FEA-EXPERIMENT)"
