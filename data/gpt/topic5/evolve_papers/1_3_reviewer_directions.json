    "title": "Rare Clinical Event Synthesis and Few-Shot Adaptation for Bias Reduction in Healthcare LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs lack adaptability and fairness robustness in rare or less-represented clinical scenarios, leading to skewed or unsafe decision support.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to an internal gap by developing novel data synthesis and adaptation strategies specifically targeting rare events using few-shot learning guided by ethical fairness constraints.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a generative framework that synthesizes high-fidelity, ethically annotated rare clinical case data via controlled prompt engineering and program synthesis techniques. Couple this with a multi-objective few-shot fine-tuning process where the LLM not only optimizes for predictive accuracy but also for fairness metrics derived from exposure to these synthetic rare cases. Incorporate fairness regularizers enforcing equity across demographic and clinical strata.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather real-world rare clinical event datasets and create ethical annotation guidelines. 2) Train controlled generation modules to produce synthetic cases matching the rare scenario distribution, validated by clinicians. 3) Fine-tune LLMs with these synthetic cases under fairness-aware loss functions. 4) Evaluate accuracy, robustness, and fairness on real and synthetic rare case benchmarks, including subgroup performance analysis.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Rare genetic disorder case input prompt. Expected output: Diagnostic support free from demographic bias, with transparent probability calibration and fairness-aware recommendations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If synthetic data inadequately represents complexity, introduce semi-supervised real-world data augmentation and active learning to iteratively improve LLM adaptation and fairness."

          "feedback_content": "The provided step-by-step experiment plan, while generally sound, lacks specific quantitative targets or benchmarks for acceptable fairness and accuracy improvements after few-shot adaptation. It also omits details on how clinician validations will be operationalized or measured for the synthetic data quality. Incorporating clearer success criteria and outlining concrete evaluation protocols, including statistical significance tests for fairness metrics across subgroups, will strengthen feasibility and reproducibility. Consider also explicit contingency plans beyond fallback for failure modes during clinician validation or fairness metric degradation post-fine-tuning to mitigate risks in real deployments. This will ensure a scientifically rigorous and practically executable experimental roadmap that can be confidently assessed and replicated by peers in clinical AI research. This feedback targets the 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' section to enhance the scientific soundness and practical execution clarity of the experiments proposed."

          "feedback_content": "Given the idea's NOV-COMPETITIVE rating and the broad thematic relevance of linked concepts, integrating federated learning could substantially augment the research impact and novelty. Specifically, designing the synthetic data generation and few-shot adaptation framework to operate under federated learning constraints would enable direct collaboration across multiple clinical institutions without sharing raw sensitive patient data. This integration would enhance data diversity, robustness, and fairness evaluations across demographics, while addressing privacy and deployment concerns inherent in healthcare AI. Suggest considering a federated framework to produce and validate synthetic rare case data, followed by fairness-aware fine-tuning distributed across client LLM nodes. Such an extension would differentiate this work in a competitive area and broaden its applicability for real-world clinical decision support systems. This comment pertains to further improving the 'Proposed_Method' section by embedding federated learning concepts for greater impact and novelty."
