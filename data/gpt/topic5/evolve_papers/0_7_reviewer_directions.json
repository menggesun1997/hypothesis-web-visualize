    "title": "Ethical AI Governance Framework Integrating Legal Compliance, Bias Auditing, and Blockchain Transparency in Financial Advisory LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM deployment in financial advisory risks ethical violations including biased advice, privacy breaches, and opaque decision-making without structured governance mechanisms.",
    "Motivation": "This idea bridges AI governance, ethics, regulatory compliance, and blockchain-enabled transparency—underexplored external gaps—by proposing a comprehensive ethical governance framework employing automated bias auditing, smart contract enforcement, and stakeholder accountability for trustworthy financial AI.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a governance platform with modules for ongoing bias detection in advisory outputs, privacy impact analyses, and immutable audit logs recorded on blockchain smart contracts. Incorporate mechanisms for actionable interventions when ethical thresholds are violated, coupled with explainable transparency dashboards for stakeholders.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Define ethical and compliance criteria with legal experts; 2) Build bias detection and privacy auditing tools; 3) Integrate blockchain ledger for transparency; 4) Pilot the framework with real advisory deployments; 5) Measure ethical incidence reductions and stakeholder trust gains.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Advisory outputs flagged for gender or racial biases; smart contract triggers review protocol; audit dashboard shows transparent correction steps and compliance reports.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain implementation is infeasible, deploy centralized trusted audit logs with cryptographic proof techniques and expand manual governance checkpoints."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an ambitious integration of bias detection, privacy auditing, and blockchain logging for governance in financial advisory LLMs, but lacks clarity on how these components interact dynamically in real deployment scenarios. Specifically, the mechanism of \"actionable interventions\" once ethical thresholds are violated requires more precise definition — for example, who or what initiates interventions, what triggers specific actions, and how the system ensures timely and effective enforcement. Clarifying these internal workflows and decision logics will significantly strengthen the soundness and operational clarity of the approach. Consider detailing the technical architecture and interfaces between bias detection modules, smart contracts, and stakeholder dashboards to better demonstrate feasibility and robustness under realistic conditions in Proposed_Method section."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan provides a reasonable high-level roadmap but misses critical details that impact feasibility and scientific rigor. Key concerns include: (a) how legal and ethical criteria will be formalized concretely and operationalized for automated auditing; (b) what datasets or advisory contexts will be used in pilot deployments to capture representative ethical risks; (c) metrics and controls for measuring \"ethical incidence reductions\" and \"stakeholder trust gains\"; and (d) the resource and timeline commitments necessary for blockchain integration and its fallback. Providing a more detailed experimental protocol, including evaluation methodologies, baselines, validation procedures, and contingency plans, will improve confidence in feasibility and reproducibility of results. Address these points explicitly to solidify the Experiment_Plan section."
