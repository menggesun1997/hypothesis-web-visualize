        "title": "Cross-Modal Micro- and Macro-Scale Fusion Transformers for Scientific Text and Figures",
        "Problem_Statement": "Scientific literature mining often requires integrating heterogeneous data modalities, notably text and embedded visual content (figures, charts). Current models struggle with efficiently representing micro (word-level) and macro (document-level) information jointly across these modalities, leading to computational inefficiencies and suboptimal semantic understanding.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the internal critical gap about inefficient multi-scale integration techniques for heterogeneous, cross-modal data, which current literature mining methods underexplore. By translating multi-scale fusion concepts from medical image segmentation to natural language plus image contexts, we propose a paradigm shift in model efficiency and semantic richness.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an asymmetric transformer architecture with dual branches: a text encoder with hierarchical span-level attention capturing micro and macro textual features, and a visual encoder extracting multi-scale image features using a feature pyramid network (FPN). A dedicated cross-modal fusion module performs multi-scale alignment via learned fusion tokens at varying semantic granularities, enabling fine-grained and global fusion. Sparse attention masks prioritize computational focus, significantly reducing overhead while maintaining rich representation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset assembly: Create a multi-modal scientific paper dataset combining full texts with embedded figures (e.g., arXiv papers with figure annotations). 2) Implement baseline models: Text-only transformers (e.g., SciBERT), vision-only FPNs, and naive multi-modal concatenations. 3) Train the proposed dual-branch fusion transformer on entity recognition, relation extraction, and figure caption generation tasks. 4) Evaluate computational efficiency (FLOPs, memory usage) and accuracy (F1-score, BLEU for captions). 5) Ablate components like fusion token design and sparse attention schemes.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A scientific article segment describing an experiment with a figure showing experimental setup. Expected Output: Correct extraction of experiment parameters and precise association of text descriptions with figure subregions (e.g., linking a textual mention of 'temperature sensor' to the corresponding figure area).",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If fusion tokens fail to converge or computational gains are minimal, explore alternative fusion strategies such as cross-attention layers replacing fusion tokens or lightweight convolutional alignment modules. Alternatively, restrict fusion to coarse scales initially and gradually scale up to multi-scale fusion."

        "title": "Masked Attention Pretraining for Low-Resource Scientific Domains",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) require extensive labeled data and compute to perform well, limiting applications in low-resource scientific fields lacking annotated corpora. Existing masked attention transformers have shown promise, but their potential for zero-/few-shot adaptation in scientific literature mining remains untapped.",
        "Motivation": "This tackles the internal gaps around dependency on large labeled datasets and computational burden, aligning with the high-potential opportunity of utilizing masked attention mechanisms and self-supervised masked autoencoding to permit efficient domain adaptation with minimal supervision.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a novel masked attention pretraining paradigm tailored for scientific literature: randomly mask spans of text and associated entity boundaries, then train a dual-purpose model that predicts the masked tokens and reconstructs their masked attention patterns. This trains the model to understand contextual boundaries and relationships implicitly, boosting zero/few-shot downstream performance. The architecture integrates boundary-sensitive mask keys to focus attention learning around entity/object borders.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Pretrain on large, unlabeled scientific texts from multiple domains with masked attention objectives. 2) Fine-tune on few-shot subsets of target low-resource domains (e.g., materials science, ecology). 3) Benchmark against conventional masked language models (e.g., SciBERT) on NER, relation extraction. 4) Evaluate sample efficiency, environmental costs (compute, energy), and accuracy improvements. 5) Ablate the components: boundary-aware masking vs. random masking.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Abstract from a niche biomedical subfield with 10 labeled examples for NER. Expected Output: High-accuracy recognition of domain entities despite limited supervision, outperforming baselines by clear margins.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If masked attention reconstruction training hinders convergence, switch to multi-task objectives combining standard masked language modeling and attention prediction as auxiliary loss. Alternatively, simplify masking to token-level instead of span-level."

        "title": "Boundary-Enhanced Diffusion Models for Fine-Grained Scientific Entity Segmentation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current approaches for fine-grained entity recognition and relation extraction in scientific literature struggle to accurately demarcate entity boundaries and differentiate overlapping or nested entities, especially with limited computational resources.",
        "Motivation": "This idea exploits the external gap of applying boundary enhancement and diffusion probabilistic models from medical imaging to scientific text domains, providing a novel means to enhance precision in extraction tasks while controlling computational complexity.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a diffusion probabilistic model adapted for sequence data that models the progressive refinement of entity boundaries in text. Augment it with a boundary enhancement module inspired by edge detection filters in vision, applied on intermediate representations to sharpen entity limits. The combined model uses iterative denoising steps to improve boundary localization and uncertainty quantification for ambiguous regions, enabling better extraction at lower compute cost.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Prepare nested entity-labeled scientific corpora (e.g., GENIA). 2) Implement conventional sequence tagging baselines and transformer-based segmentation models. 3) Build diffusion-based boundary-enhanced entity segmentation model. 4) Evaluate segmentation accuracy (precision, recall, IoU), compute efficiency, and calibration of uncertainty estimates. 5) Perform case studies on extremely ambiguous or overlapping entities.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentence with overlapping mentions like 'human T-cell leukemia virus' vs 'T-cell'. Expected Output: Distinct span boundaries for each entity with confidence scores, accurately segregating overlapping segments.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If diffusion modeling on sequences proves unstable or slow, explore hybrid architectures integrating CNN-based boundary detectors with transformer taggers, or replace diffusion steps with learned residual refinement modules."

        "title": "Sparse Cross-Scale Attention for Efficient Scientific Literature Mining",
        "Problem_Statement": "Transformers for scientific literature processing have scaling issues when integrating multi-scale information due to quadratic attention complexity, leading to high computational and environmental costs.",
        "Motivation": "This idea directly addresses the internal computational bottlenecks and memory constraints while exploiting multi-scale feature integration gaps by introducing a sparse, cross-scale attention mechanism inspired by efficient attention models and feature fusion from vision.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a transformer variant where attention computation is restricted to a sparse subset of tokens selected based on cross-scale relevance scores computed via lightweight selectors. Tokens across scales attend selectively, allowing high-priority interactions while pruning redundant ones, enabling efficient semantic fusion of document segments of varying granularity (words, sentences, sections).",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build or select scientific paper text datasets. 2) Compare with dense transformer baselines on entity recognition and document classification. 3) Profile compute/memory use and inference speed. 4) Test impact of varying sparsity levels and selector strategies. 5) Measure environmental impact via estimated energy consumption.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Full scientific article requiring classification of section topics and extraction of key entities. Expected Output: Accurate semantic understanding of multi-granularity units with 50% less compute than dense attention baselines.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If sparse selectors degrade accuracy significantly, integrate learnable dynamic thresholds or fallback to block-wise dense attention within selected segments. Alternatively, combine with knowledge distillation to retain performance."

        "title": "Joint Multi-Domain Contrastive Pretraining for Scientific Text and Visual Data",
        "Problem_Statement": "Scientific literature mining models often suffer from domain overfitting and poor generalization across heterogeneous scientific disciplines, especially when merging textual and visual modalities.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the less explored external gap about leveraging cross-disciplinary advances, this approach uses joint contrastive training inspired by vision-language representation learning to improve robustness and efficiency across scientific domains while mitigating heavy supervised demands.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create a multi-domain, multi-modal contrastive pretraining framework where representations of paired text (e.g., figure captions, paragraphs) and images (figures, diagrams) are aligned in a shared embedding space. Contrastive losses encourage semantic equivalence without exhaustive labeled annotations. The architecture employs asymmetric encoders optimized for different domains with cross-domain projection heads enabling zero-shot work on unseen scientific fields.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect a large corpus of paired multi-modal scientific content across fields (bio, physics, CS). 2) Pretrain joint encoders with contrastive objectives. 3) Fine-tune on downstream tasks like cross-modal retrieval, entity tagging, and relationship extraction in underrepresented domains with limited data. 4) Compare against domain-specific single-modality models. 5) Monitor environmental savings vs. performance gains.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Query text 'activation energy diagrams' and figure images from chemistry papers. Expected Output: Correct retrieval of semantically relevant figures and linked textual explanations even for rarely seen domains.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If contrastive training is unstable or negative transfer occurs, experiment with domain-adaptive contrastive heads or gradually introduced curriculum learning focusing on single domains first before joint training."
