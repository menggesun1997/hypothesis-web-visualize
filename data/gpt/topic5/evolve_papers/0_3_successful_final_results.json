        "title": "Cross-Domain Explainability Framework Leveraging Neurosymbolic AI for Financial Advisory LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) in financial advisory face critical challenges with explainability, especially when justifying complex investment advice under stringent regulatory requirements like the EU AI Act. Both users and regulators demand transparent, auditable, and trustworthy explanations to establish compliance and trustworthiness, yet current models often produce opaque outputs with hallucinated or unsupported claims, undermining confidence and adoption in enterprise financial services.",
        "Motivation": "While neurosymbolic AI—integrating symbolic reasoning with neural networks—has been explored, existing methods lack granular, dynamic interaction mechanisms between symbolic financial ontologies and neural embeddings, limiting their explainability effectiveness in risk-sensitive financial domains. This research advances the field by developing a novel, interactive neurosymbolic architecture that dynamically reconciles neural outputs with symbolic reasoning under regulatory constraints, enhancing explanation fidelity and trust. By aligning with emerging standards such as the EU AI Act and emphasizing human-computer interaction (HCI) principles for effective explanation delivery, our approach offers significant improvements in transparency, regulatory compliance, and business value over prior work—thus addressing gaps that limit competitiveness.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular neurosymbolic architecture integrating an LLM-based neural module with a symbolic reasoning engine leveraging a comprehensive finance ontology comprising regulatory rules, investment concepts, and risk metrics. The core mechanism involves a two-way interaction pipeline:\\n\\n1. **Neural Proposal Generation:** The LLM generates initial financial advice and latent embeddings representing contextual and semantic information. \\n2. **Symbolic Verification & Augmentation:** The symbolic reasoner parses this advice into formal logic rules and queries the ontology and financial knowledge bases. It verifies rule consistency, compliance to EU AI Act mandates, and flags conflicts or hallucinations. \\n3. **Dynamic Conflict Resolution:** Upon detecting ambiguities or contradictions, the symbolic system issues constraint feedback prompting the neural module to refine outputs via a controlled re-generation loop guided by symbolic constraints operating through attention modulation and embedding adjustment. \\n4. **Interactive Explanation Synthesis:** The system builds detailed, human-comprehensible explanation chains combining symbolic inference paths, rule citations, and neural contextualization, presented through an interactive visualization interface designed following HCI best practices for explainable AI.\\n\\nConcretely, an example interaction shows the LLM suggesting a bond investment; the symbolic engine verifies risk assessments against real-time financial data and regulatory thresholds. If discrepancies arise, the system identifies specific conflicting rules (e.g., minimum risk exposure limits) and requests neural adjustment, iterating until outputs align and a compliant, transparent rationale is constructed. This pipeline supports robust hallucination detection by cross-referencing proposed statements with knowledge bases, enabling targeted, traceable corrections and confidence scoring. By combining generative AI capabilities with symbolic rigor and regulatory alignment, the framework enables enterprise-grade, plausible, and auditable financial advisory explanations.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) **Ontology and Knowledge Base Development:** Curate and formalize a comprehensive symbolic ontology capturing financial advisory logic, regulatory frameworks (e.g., EU AI Act), investment risk profiles, and compliance constraints using open financial datasets and expert elicitation.\n\\n2) **Component Integration & Interface Programming:** Build modular connectors between the LLM embeddings (e.g., via transformer attention manipulation) and symbolic reasoner ensuring two-way communication for dynamic feedback during advice generation.\n\\n3) **Data Acquisition & Augmentation:** Recognizing limited availability of richly annotated financial reasoning datasets due to proprietary restrictions, develop a hybrid dataset by combining publicly available financial question-answer pairs with synthetically generated reasoning chains using rule-based simulators and semi-supervised learning techniques.\n\\n4) **Training & Fine-Tuning:** Train the neurosymbolic pipeline on this augmented dataset, incorporating reinforcement signals from hallucination checks and symbolic consistency.\n\\n5) **Standardized Expert Evaluation Protocol:** Design an objective evaluation framework with measurable metrics such as explanation fidelity (match to ontology logic), clarity (quantified via Likert scales by multiple financial experts), and hallucination detection accuracy. Establish inter-rater reliability standards and use blind review to minimize bias.\n\\n6) **Benchmarking:** Compare the system against standard LLM advisory models without neurosymbolic integration on multiple financial advisory tasks, measuring explainability quality, compliance adherence, and user trust scores.\n\\n7) **HCI-guided User Studies:** Deploy interactive explanation interfaces following HCI principles with finance professionals and regulators to assess usability, comprehension, and business impact in realistic scenarios.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Recommend bond investment given low risk and stable returns.\"\n\\nOutput Explanation: The system generates a symbolic inference chain stating: \"Bond investment is preferred as the asset class meets the risk threshold defined by the regulatory-compliant risk ontology (e.g., max 3% volatility), historical default rates are below 0.5%, and portfolio diversification constraints according to financial regulations are satisfied.\" The explanation visualizes the logical derivation, cites exact regulatory clauses implicated (e.g., EU AI Act Article 22 compliance), and highlights any uncertainty or hallucinated elements flagged and reprocessed through the dynamic resolution loop.\n\\nMultiple test cases simulate ambiguous inputs, conflicting regulatory clauses, or novel financial instruments, ensuring the mechanism's robustness in conflict detection, reasoning transparency, and compliance assurance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the full neurosymbolic integration pipeline proves infeasible within resource or data constraints, pivot to a hybrid approach using advanced post-hoc explanation methods tailored for LLM financial advice outputs. This includes modular, subdomain-specific explainers for discrete financial topics (e.g., credit risk, portfolio optimization) leveraging rule-based overlays to enhance transparency. Additionally, explore synthetic data generation and semi-supervised learning to progressively improve explanation quality. These fallback options maintain commitment to improved explainability and regulatory alignment, ensuring partial but meaningful advances toward enterprise AI trustworthiness."

Specifically, how the system resolves conflicts or ambiguous cases between neural outputs and symbolic rules is not elaborated. Strengthening this explanation with more concrete architectural details or algorithms will increase confidence in the method's soundness and operational feasibility. Consider including example interaction scenarios between components to clarify reasoning flow and hallucination detection mechanisms more explicitly for reviewers and future implementers, ensuring foundational transparency and trust in the approach's validity and replicability, especially given the domain complexity in financial regulations and reasoning rules integration.\" The current description potentially falls short of enabling reproducibility or clear assessment of expected behavior under challenging inputs, hence improving this aspect is critical for the research's foundational integrity and acceptance in a premier venue.\" Target this in the Proposed_Method section for improvement."

Additionally, the plan does not specify how the expert assessment will be standardized or operationalized to ensure objective, reproducible evaluation of explanation fidelity and clarity. Enhancing the plan by addressing data sourcing strategies, potential need for synthetic or semi-supervised data augmentation, and formalizing evaluation protocols with measurable metrics will significantly increase practical viability and scientific rigor. This feedback should be addressed within the Experiment_Plan section."
