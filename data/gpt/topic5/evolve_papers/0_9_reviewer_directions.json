    "title": "Cross-Modal Ontology-Guided LLM Calibration Incorporating Blockchain-Based Provenance for Financial Advice Trustworthiness",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs lack calibrated confidence aligned with ontological finance knowledge and provenance traceability, decreasing trust and complicating error correction.",
    "Motivation": "Combines internal gaps (confidence calibration and hallucination correction) with external gaps (blockchain transparency) introducing a novel cross-modal approach that adjusts LLM confidence scores using ontology-driven constraints and provenance data immutably recorded via blockchain for enhanced trustworthy financial advice.",
    "Proposed_Method": "1) Develop a financial ontology mapping key concepts and constraints; 2) Implement a calibration layer that adjusts LLM output confidence by comparing predicted facts against the ontology; 3) Link all provenance metadata to blockchain entries ensuring auditable, tamper-proof traceability; 4) Use calibrated confidence thresholds to suppress or highlight output uncertainty.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build ontology and provenance datasets; 2) Train LLM calibration model; 3) Integrate blockchain storage for provenance; 4) Evaluate calibration reliability, hallucination reduction, and auditability; 5) Conduct user trust experiments.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Investment advice with confidence 90% but ontology flags partial inconsistency; recalibrated confidence lowered to 70%. Provenance ledger shows data sources and verification timestamps.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time integration is too slow, employ batch calibration and off-chain provenance indexing combined with cryptographic proofs."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a high-level approach combining ontology-based calibration, LLM confidence adjustment, and blockchain provenance, but the mechanism details remain underspecified. Specifically, the calibration layer's technical workings—how it quantitatively adjusts confidence scores based on ontological constraints, and how it integrates with LLM outputs—require clarification. Also, the method for linking provenance metadata immutably to the blockchain and subsequently using that data to influence LLM outputs needs elaboration. Detailing these mechanisms with respect to model architecture, data flows, and real-time operation will enhance soundness and credibility of the approach, making it clearer how proposed components interact to reduce hallucinations and improve trustworthiness in financial advice generation. Including example algorithms or preliminary design diagrams could strengthen this section significantly, making it actionable for implementation and review purposes (Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the idea's pre-screening as NOV-COMPETITIVE due to its combination of well-studied components (LLM calibration, ontologies, blockchain provenance), a promising direction to elevate impact and novelty is to integrate concepts from 'human-computer interaction' and 'digital forensics.' For example, designing an interactive user interface that leverages the calibrated confidence scores and blockchain provenance to provide explainable, actionable feedback to end-users would enhance trust and usability of financial advice systems. Additionally, incorporating forensic analysis techniques into provenance auditing could enable automated detection and alerting of suspicious or anomalous advice patterns. Embedding this cross-disciplinary perspective can differentiate the work by showcasing practical, user-centered trustworthiness enhancements beyond algorithmic improvements, potentially opening new research and application avenues and increasing the work's relevance and scope (Globally-Linked Concepts)."
