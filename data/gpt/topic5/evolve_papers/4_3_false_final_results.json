    "title": "Organizational Behavior-Guided Human-AI Hybrid Calibration Framework",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current AI adaptation strategies in legal domains largely overlook human factors and organizational behavior theories, resulting in poor model adoption, suboptimal calibration in workflows, and missed opportunities for synergistic human-AI collaboration particularly under domain-shift conditions.",
    "Motivation": "This idea fills an external critical gap by merging organizational behavior and digital transformation insights with AI calibration. It proposes a novel human-AI hybrid framework that optimizes domain adaptation via interactive calibration loops shaped by real-world workflow dynamics and user acceptance models, thereby bridging AI research and organizational capital modeling.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a feedback-driven calibration platform where legal professionals provide structured interactive inputs (corrections, confidence assessments, rationale annotations) during real casework. Use reinforcement learning to optimize LLM calibration policies that adapt to feedback patterns reflecting organizational behavior dynamics (e.g., trust, resistance factors). Incorporate digital transformation theories to model and simulate adoption trajectories guiding incremental AI updates.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Model organizational behavior traits influencing AI adoption from surveys and literature. 2. Develop interactive interfaces for human feedback during legal AI usage. 3. Implement reinforcement learning algorithms that incorporate human feedback for adaptive model fine-tuning. 4. Deploy in pilot legal teams and track workflow efficiency, calibration improvements, and user satisfaction. 5. Compare against static fine-tuned models lacking human feedback integration.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A junior legal analyst reviewing AI-generated case summaries flags an ambiguous clause with rationale. Expected output: The system updates calibration to reduce ambiguity in similar future cases and notifies analysts of improved confidence, demonstrating iterative human-AI co-adaptation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time human feedback integration is impractical, implement batch feedback collection and periodic recalibration. Alternatively, simulate organizational behavior using synthetic feedback models to pre-train calibration policies before deployment."
