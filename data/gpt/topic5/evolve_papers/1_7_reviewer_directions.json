    "title": "Policy-Aware LLM Framework for Fairness Governance in Healthcare AI Systems",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of integration between fairness research and healthcare policy governance frameworks governing system deployment, impairing ethical compliance.",
    "Motivation": "Fills an external gap by linking transformer LLMs with digital transformation and policy governance concepts, enabling AI fairness monitoring aligned with institutional policies.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an LLM framework augmented with policy embedding layers encoding institutional fairness and ethical governance policies. Model outputs are dynamically constrained and audited against these embeddings. A governance console provides transparency for administrators to monitor fairness compliance, incident reporting, and model auditing under evolving policies.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect a corpus of healthcare policy documents focused on AI ethics and fairness. 2) Develop policy embedding schemas and incorporate them into LLM decoding constraints. 3) Simulate clinical decision scenarios with varying policy environments. 4) Evaluate compliance accuracy, system transparency, and governance usability with stakeholders.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Scenario: A hospital policy mandates equitable risk scoring across patient demographics. The LLM respects this via policy embeddings, refusing or flagging outputs violating fairness constraints.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If policy embeddings reduce model fluency excessively, shift toward post-hoc output auditing and alerting with human governance-in-the-loop frameworks."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed integration of policy embedding layers within the LLM is intriguing but lacks concrete clarity on how these embeddings will dynamically constrain and audit outputs at decoding time. More explicit methodological detailing is needed to clarify how policy embeddings interact with the transformer architecture, how fairness constraints are operationalized during generation, and what auditing mechanisms ensure compliance. Without this, the approach risks ambiguity and difficulty in reproducibility or evaluation of soundness in practice. Please provide a clearer and technically grounded specification of the policy-aware mechanism within the LLM's decoding and auditing pipeline, including any algorithmic or architectural innovations enabling this dynamic fairness governance functionality, or relevant prior work adaptations serving as a base framework for soundness assurance in this complex integration scenario.\n\nThis clarity is critical to validate assumptions about model compliance capabilities and transparency claims and to build confidence in the practical feasibility of enforcement at runtime versus post-hoc checks or rules-based filters only. Otherwise, this key conceptual bridge remains an underdeveloped core risk in overall soundness and contribution validity."

          "feedback_content": "To enhance impact and novelty beyond a competitive baseline, consider integrating attribute-based access control (ABAC) models with your policy-aware LLM framework. Incorporating ABAC principles can enable fine-grained, dynamic enforcement of healthcare fairness policies tied to user roles, context, and data attributes, effectively bridging policy embeddings with practical access and action controls in healthcare AI systems. \n\nAdditionally, link your framework with electronic health records (EHR) security paradigms to ensure that fairness governance coexists robustly with patient data privacy and security requirements. This integration can expand the scope from fairness monitoring alone to a holistic governance ecosystem addressing ethics, compliance, transparency, and security together.\n\nLeveraging insights from neural network interpretability and recent developments in Generative Pretrained Transformer architectures tailored for nursing education or clinical decision support can offer novel avenues for explainability and domain-specific adaptation, further increasing practical adoption potential and conference impact. Such global integration of health informatics, security, NLP, and governance concepts will differentiate your approach and amplify its relevance and appeal in this highly competitive research area."
