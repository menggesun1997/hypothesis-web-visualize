    "title": "Cross-Domain Explainability Framework Leveraging Neurosymbolic AI for Financial Advisory LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs struggle with explainability in complex financial domains; users and regulators require transparent justifications of advice to build trust and meet compliance.",
    "Motivation": "Responding to internal gaps in explainability and hallucination correction, this research proposes merging neurosymbolic AI—combining symbolic reasoning with neural methods—to generate logically structured, human-understandable explanations aligned with financial regulations.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Integrate symbolic finance ontologies with neural LLM embeddings via a neurosymbolic pipeline that parses advice into logical rules. The system visualizes reasoning paths and identifies hallucinated content by checking rule consistency with financial knowledge bases, enabling targeted corrections and explainable outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Create a symbolic ontology for finance advisory reasoning; 2) Develop interface layers between LLM and symbolic reasoner; 3) Train with datasets annotated for reasoning steps; 4) Evaluate fidelity and clarity of explanations via expert assessment; 5) Benchmark hallucination detection accuracy compared to standard LLM outputs.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Recommend bond investment due to low risk and stable returns.' Output includes a symbolic chain outlining risk assessment rules, historical default rates, and regulatory compliance validations supporting the recommendation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If neurosymbolic integration is insufficient, apply post-hoc explanation methods or focus on modular explainers for specific financial subdomains."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section outlines an integration of symbolic finance ontologies with LLM embeddings via neurosymbolic pipelines; however, the mechanism lacks detailed clarity on how the symbolic reasoning interplays dynamically with neural embeddings during advice generation. Specifically, how the system resolves conflicts or ambiguous cases between neural outputs and symbolic rules is not elaborated. Strengthening this explanation with more concrete architectural details or algorithms will increase confidence in the method's soundness and operational feasibility. Consider including example interaction scenarios between components to clarify reasoning flow and hallucination detection mechanisms more explicitly for reviewers and future implementers, ensuring foundational transparency and trust in the approach's validity and replicability, especially given the domain complexity in financial regulations and reasoning rules integration.\" The current description potentially falls short of enabling reproducibility or clear assessment of expected behavior under challenging inputs, hence improving this aspect is critical for the research's foundational integrity and acceptance in a premier venue.\" Target this in the Proposed_Method section for improvement."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan involves ontology creation, interface development, training with annotated datasets, expert evaluation, and benchmarking hallucination detection; however, the plan lacks clear discussion on the feasibility and availability of sufficiently rich and high-quality annotated datasets covering detailed reasoning steps in financial advisory contexts, which are notoriously hard to obtain due to proprietary and privacy constraints. Additionally, the plan does not specify how the expert assessment will be standardized or operationalized to ensure objective, reproducible evaluation of explanation fidelity and clarity. Enhancing the plan by addressing data sourcing strategies, potential need for synthetic or semi-supervised data augmentation, and formalizing evaluation protocols with measurable metrics will significantly increase practical viability and scientific rigor. This feedback should be addressed within the Experiment_Plan section."
