        "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Bias Calibration Dashboard Embedding Performing Arts Techniques with Operationalized Bias Adjustment in Clinical AI",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current bias mitigation tools in clinical AI often lack continuous, context-sensitive human expert input implemented through engaging and intuitive interfaces, limiting the detection and correction of subtle biases that affect health equity and patient safety.",
        "Motivation": "Integrating human-computer interaction with affective computing and performance arts principles, we aim to create a novel, culturally rich dashboard that goes beyond conventional annotation tools by harnessing narrative and theatrical techniques to surface latent biases. This approach uniquely combines human intuition and domain expertise with precise, technical bias calibration mechanisms, addressing prior competitive novelty concerns by grounding interaction design in measurable model adjustment, thereby elevating transparency, clinician engagement, and AI fairness in sensitive healthcare settings.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose an interactive dashboard that visualizes LLM-generated clinical dialogues as modular performative scenes. Healthcare experts engage with these scenes via theatrical interventions like role reversal and script rewriting, facilitated by user interface affordances tied to structured semantic annotations. Each intervention generates a structured annotation data object that captures: (1) the original utterance, (2) user-modified text, (3) intervention type (e.g., bias flagging, alternative phrasing), and (4) contextual metadata (e.g., patient demographics, clinical scenario). These annotations feed into a bias correction module implemented as a multi-stage pipeline: (a) annotation validation leveraging inter-rater agreement metrics and expert consensus scoring; (b) conversion of qualitative inputs into quantitative bias scores using natural language processing feature extraction and affective computing sentiment analysis; (c) dynamic update of model parameters via a calibrated fine-tuning algorithm, grounded in constrained optimization methods to maintain clinical accuracy. The system architecture integrates user interface components with backend APIs supporting real-time annotation ingestion, bias metric computation, and parameter adjustment within a continuous learning framework. Pseudocode outlining data flows and transformation functions is included to document reproducibility. This human-in-the-loop approach operationalizes culturally informed theatrical techniques into measurable signals, enabling precise bias mitigation suited for clinical AI where patient outcomes demand rigorous fairness controls.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop the dashboard prototype embedding theatrical metaphors with interactive modules for role reversal, script rewriting, and bias flagging, supported by structured annotation export. 2) Conduct pilot usability studies with healthcare professionals and clinical ethicists to refine interface intuitiveness and annotation consistency. 3) Collect a corpus of annotated performative scenes over multiple iterative cycles to train and validate inter-rater reliability (target Cohen’s kappa > 0.75). 4) Implement the backend bias correction pipeline to quantitatively map annotations to model fine-tuning updates, validating bias score correlations with external clinical fairness metrics. 5) Design controlled experiments comparing the dashboard approach against baseline annotation tools without theatrical features, evaluating outcomes on bias detection rate, clinician engagement (via standard engagement questionnaires), and AI fairness improvements measured by statistical parity difference and calibration error over sequential training epochs. 6) Address practical challenges: recruit diverse domain experts for iterative annotation rounds, establish annotation quality control protocols, and optimize computational budgets for incremental model updates on GPU clusters. 7) Document timelines, data volumes (target >1000 annotated scenes per iteration), and resource allocations to establish experimental rigor and reproducibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Scenario: A clinician reviewing an AI-generated patient interaction identifies stigmatizing language. Using the dashboard, they role-reverse the patient and clinician dialogue to reveal implicit power dynamics, and then rewrite the script to neutralize biased phrasing. These structured annotations are confirmed by a second expert for validation and subsequently converted into bias scores that trigger constrained fine-tuning of the language model. The updated model then produces mitigated dialogue in subsequent clinical simulations, measurable by reduced bias metrics and positive clinician feedback.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If theatrical interaction complexity impedes usability or consistent high-quality annotation, switch to a streamlined annotation interface embedding narrative prompts and affective feedback cues to focus on clearer, simpler human input signals. Emphasize robust annotation validation and automated bias scoring pipelines to retain operationalizable bias calibration benefits while minimizing cognitive load on experts."

However, the mechanism bridging qualitative theatrical user input and quantitative model fine-tuning is currently insufficiently detailed. Clarify precisely how narrative-driven annotations (e.g., role reversal, script rewriting) will be operationalized into measurable model parameter updates. Explicitly explain the data representations, model components, and bias correction algorithms involved. This will ensure that the method is not only conceptually compelling but also technically sound and reproducible for bias mitigation in clinical AI contexts, where precision is critical to patient outcomes and fairness assessments. Adding technical schematics or pseudocode would strengthen this section significantly, making the interactive performance paradigm more concretely actionable rather than purely metaphorical or illustrative in nature.  Without this, the risk remains that the system is more performative storytelling than effective bias calibration tool, weakening soundness and real-world applicability."

However, it lacks granularity on how iterative human input via theatrical methods will quantitatively feed back into bias-correction fine-tuning pipelines. Specifically, the plan should detail how expert annotations and simulated dialogues are collected, validated, and incorporated into retraining or adjustment cycles — including metrics, timelines, data volume needs, and computational resources. Consider adding controlled experiments comparing the dashboard's influence against baseline annotation or bias correction methods to establish experimental rigor and feasibility. Moreover, address potential challenges such as recruiting sufficient domain experts for iterative cycles and ensuring consistency/quality of qualitative theatrical inputs. Strengthening these operational details will enhance feasibility confidence and make the plan scientifically credible and implementable for a premier conference context."
