    "Problem_Statement": "Financial LLMs relying solely on static training data risk hallucinations and outdated or misleading advice, especially given volatile market news and social sentiment dynamics.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the internal gap in hallucination detection, this project integrates multi-modal data streams—real-time financial news, social media sentiment, and structured market data—to dynamically validate and correct LLM advice, reducing misinformation risks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a pipeline that fuses LLM outputs with sentiment analysis modules analyzing live news and social media (Twitter, financial forums). Discrepancies between advisory claims and emerging sentiment triggers re-assessment or user alerts. Employ contrastive learning to align multi-modal signals with advisory truths.",

        "title": "Multi-Modal Financial Advisory Framework Incorporating Real-Time News, Social Sentiment, and AI Governance Compliance for Robust Misinformation Detection",
        "Problem_Statement": "Financial LLMs that rely solely on static training datasets risk producing hallucinated, outdated, or misleading advice, particularly under volatile market conditions characterized by rapid news cycles and shifting social sentiment. Moreover, current approaches often lack mechanisms for robust misinformation detection that integrate legal and ethical considerations mandated by emerging AI regulations, leaving financial advisory systems vulnerable to compliance risks and diminished user trust.",
        "Motivation": "To address crucial gaps in hallucination detection and regulatory compliance, this project proposes a novel framework that unifies real-time multi-modal data streams—financial news, social media sentiment, and structured market indicators—with explicit integration of AI governance principles such as those embodied in the Artificial Intelligence Act and Digital Services Act. By embedding transparency, explainability, and user rights protections into the misinformation detection workflow, alongside a rigorous ethical red teaming evaluation, this research advances a uniquely comprehensive solution. This approach not only elevates misinformation detection accuracy and timeliness beyond existing methods but also ensures practical, legal, and ethical robustness, appealing to financial firms navigating complex AI regulatory landscapes and demanding trustworthy advisory AI products.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a detailed architecture comprising the following components:  \n\n1. Multi-Modal Data Fusion Module: Ingests real-time financial news, social media posts (e.g., Twitter, financial forums), and structured financial indicators, using preprocessing pipelines with quality control filters to mitigate noise and misinformation.  \n\n2. Contrastive Representation Learning Layer: Employ supervised contrastive learning on curated labeled datasets linking advisory claims to validated multi-modal signals—paired with adversarial examples simulating misinformation scenarios—to learn joint embeddings that tightly align truthful advisory statements with corroborating multi-modal evidence while pushing apart misleading or hallucinated claims. The training dataset includes timestamped news reports, sentiment analysis scores, and verified market outcomes to enable temporal grounding.  \n\n3. Advisory Output Validation Engine: At inference, newly generated LLM financial advice is embedded into the learned representation space and compared against fused multi-modal evidence embeddings. Significant discrepancies (quantified by embedding distances exceeding adaptive thresholds learned during training) trigger a hierarchical reassessment process. This process re-evaluates the claim considering contextual ambiguity, confidence scores, and latent conflicting data streams. The system leverages probabilistic reasoning modules to handle conflicting or ambiguous data, reducing false alarms and preserving advisory quality.  \n\n4. Explainability and Compliance Layer: To operationalize AI governance principles, all validation decisions are accompanied by human-interpretable explanations extracted via integrated natural language explanation models anchored to the contrastive learning outputs. This layer also monitors compliance with legal duties and user rights by recording provenance metadata aligned with the Artificial Intelligence Act and Digital Services Act mandates.  \n\n5. Ethical Red Teaming Phase: Prior to deployment, a dedicated red team simulates diverse adversarial failure modes, systemic biases, and data poisoning scenarios to proactively identify weaknesses in misinformation detection and compliance mechanisms. Feedback is cyclically used to refine the robustness and fairness of the entire pipeline.  \n\nThis integrated approach guarantees sound, transparent, and legally compliant misinformation detection tailored for real-time financial advisory applications, addressing complexity and reliability under volatile market conditions while distinguishing itself through its compliance-aware design and interpretability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Collection and Curation: Acquire high-quality, timestamped financial news feeds, social media datasets annotated for sentiment and misinformation, and structured financial indicators; curate adversarial and real-world misinformation samples.  \n2) Contrastive Learning Module Development: Design and train the supervised contrastive learning model on paired advisory-multi-modal data; validate embedding alignment and separation metrics.  \n3) Inference-time Validation Logic: Implement discrepancy detection algorithms with adaptive thresholds; develop probabilistic conflict-resolution mechanisms for ambiguous data.  \n4) Integration of Explainability and Compliance Features: Build explanation generation models; embed provenance tracking; implement compliance checks per AI Act and Digital Services Act guidelines.  \n5) System Robustness Evaluation: Benchmark sentiment and misinformation detection on curated and adversarial datasets; measure latency, noise resilience, and real-time operational behavior with live feeds; define and test performance metrics and fallback mode triggers.  \n6) Ethical Red Teaming Evaluation: Conduct simulated attacks, bias audits, and legal compliance scenario testing; iteratively refine modules.  \n7) User Studies: Evaluate user trust, transparency perceptions, and timeliness under realistic constraints, ensuring alignment with system performance and legal considerations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: Input advisory states 'Company Q is experiencing steady growth with increasing market share.' The system simultaneously ingests a breaking news report indicating a critical product recall and a surge in negative social sentiment. The contrastive module detects high embedding divergence and triggers a reassessment, resulting in a cautious update or a flagged alert with an explainable rationale highlighting the conflicting real-time evidence.  \n\nExample 2: Advisory claims 'Stock X’s fundamentals remain strong, suggesting buy.' However, adversarially manipulated social media posts attempt to artificially inflate sentiment. The data quality control and adversarial training within the contrastive model mitigate false positives by down-weighting unreliable data, maintaining advisory integrity.  \n\nExample 3: The system records all validation decisions with provenance and generates human-readable explanations compliant with the Artificial Intelligence Act, facilitating auditability by financial regulators and end-users.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time data streams exhibit excessive noise, latency, or unreliability that degrade misinformation detection performance beyond acceptable thresholds, the system will gracefully degrade to a weighted batch-processing mode wherein multi-modal signals are ingested at periodic intervals with enhanced cleaning. Advisory outputs will include explicit uncertainty annotations. Concurrently, reliance on robust structured financial indicators will be increased to maintain advisory stability. Further, manual override and human-in-the-loop review protocols will be engaged in critical scenarios to ensure compliance and user trust, preventing propagation of misinformation during degraded system states."

Clarify the architecture, training data specifics, and the inference-time interplay between components to ensure sound integration and effective misinformation detection. For example, specify how real-time conflicting signals will trigger re-assessment and how the model handles ambiguous or conflicting data to prevent false alerts or degraded advisory quality, thus strengthening the method’s soundness and transparency of operations for replication and evaluation purposes. This detailed articulation is crucial given the complexity and real-time nature of the system, to build confidence in practical feasibility and reliability under volatile market conditions, which are not trivial challenges here. This should be prioritized before scaling or integration stages in the experimental plan to avoid compounded system errors later on, ensuring a robust foundation for the claimed hallucination detection improvements in financial LLMs presented in the Problem_Statement and Motivation sections.\n\nTarget: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "The presented Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is a sound overall flow but needs enhancement in handling the known challenges of noisy, real-time financial news and social media data often plagued by misinformation and rapid shifts. Explicitly incorporate strategies for data quality control, latency assessment, and system robustness evaluations, such as: 1) benchmark sentiment analysis on curated and adversarial datasets simulating misinformation, 2) characterize noise impact and processing delays with live feeds, 3) establish clear performance metrics and thresholds triggering fallback mode, and 4) plan for iterative adaptation or online fine-tuning under real operational conditions. Without these refinements, claims of misinformation detection accuracy and real-time performance risk being overly optimistic or not reproducible. Adding user trust and timeliness studies is a strength, but those must be aligned to realistic system constraints that the plan currently under-specifies. Improving these facets will enhance feasibility and make the research contribution clearer and more convincing for deployment in financial advisory settings sensitive to legal and ethical risk exposures described in the broader financial industry context.\n\nTarget: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
