    "title": "Moral Reasoning Transparency Layer Using Theological Ethical Ontologies for Healthcare AI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Transparency in moral reasoning of LLM outputs in clinical decision support remains limited, obscuring trustworthy ethical alignment.",
    "Motivation": "Targets internal ethical transparency gap by integrating formal theological ethical ontologies into LLM reasoning processes, pioneering transparent moral explanation layers.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a middleware transparency layer that extracts LLM-generated clinical decisions and systematically maps them onto formal ontologies derived from theological ethical frameworks (e.g., virtue ethics, deontological principles). This mapping produces human-readable moral reasoning chains and conflict flags, enabling clinicians to trace ethical rationales and detect normativity failures or toxic degeneration risks.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collaborate with ethicists to formalize theological ethical ontologies codified in knowledge graphs. 2) Develop interfaces translating LLM outputs into ontology-driven moral reasoning chains. 3) Pilot with clinical decision tasks involving ethical dilemmas, comparing transparency and trust against standard explanations. 4) Assess clinician understanding, moral certainty, and fairness outcomes.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Treatment plan for end-of-life care involving patient autonomy. The layer outputs a mapped reasoning trail citing principles like 'respect for autonomy' and 'do no harm,' highlighting conflicts and supporting clinician reflection.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If ontology mapping is too rigid, fallback to hybrid symbolic-neural approaches incorporating moral direction embeddings alongside ontology fragments to maintain flexibility."

          "feedback_content": "The foundational assumption that theological ethical ontologies can be consistently and unambiguously formalized and integrated into LLM outputs for clinical reasoning requires deeper justification. Ethical frameworks from theology often encompass diverse, sometimes conflicting doctrines and interpretations that may not translate cleanly into formal ontologies. Clarify how you will resolve ontology conflicts or pluralism arising from multiple theological traditions, especially in diverse clinical contexts. Without this, the transparency layer risks propagating confusion rather than alleviating it in ethical decision-making processes, potentially undermining trust rather than enhancing it. More explicit scope or limits on which theological traditions or ethical constructs will be encoded can improve conceptual soundness and applicability of the approach in healthcare AI contexts that are broadly acceptable and legally compliant, rather than narrowly theological or doctrinal. This is crucial given the complex and pluralistic moral landscape in real-world clinical settings, especially considering patient autonomy and cultural diversity evident in the problem statement and test cases.  \n\nRecommendations:\n- Integrate a rigorous method for selecting and reconciling ontologies\n- Explicitly address handling conflicts or ambiguities in ethical principles\n- Address potential tensions between theological ethics and secular medical ethics to ensure legal and institutional compatibility. This will reinforce the assumption's validity and the method's foundational robustness. \n\nSection: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "While the experiment plan outlines critical multidisciplinary collaboration and pilot validation with clinicians, the feasibility concerns emerge regarding the complexity and measurability of key outcomes.\n\n1) Formalizing theological ethical ontologies into knowledge graphs is a non-trivial task requiring extensive input from ethicists, theologians, and knowledge engineers. It may be both time-consuming and difficult to operationalize in a consistent format suitable for seamless LLM integration.\n\n2) Translating LLM outputs accurately into ontology-driven moral reasoning chains needs a robust interpretability mechanism, which also requires verification and validation. It is unclear how this translation will be automated or evaluated beyond anecdotal or qualitative assessments.\n\n3) The pilot involving ethical dilemmas and clinician evaluation proposes assessing \"moral certainty\" and \"fairness outcomes,\" which are complex constructs to operationally define and measure reliably. Clear metrics, control baselines, and validated instruments must be described to ensure scientific rigor.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Include detailed methodological plans for ontology engineering, including scope, guidelines, and quality control measures.\n- Develop a quantitative or semi-quantitative method for evaluating moral reasoning chain correctness and clinician trust.\n- Specify precise instruments and criteria for measuring clinician understanding, moral certainty, and fairness to enhance experiment practicability and replicability.\n\nSection: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment notes a highly competitive area with existing strong links between ethical AI and ontology integration, the impact and novelty of your idea would benefit from explicitly integrating global theological and cultural ethical traditions from the 'Globally-Linked Concepts,' such as the Islamic tradition or the theology of life, which are underexplored in current AI ethics transparency research.\n\nConcrete suggestion:\n- Expand the ethical ontologies beyond typical Western philosophical frameworks to incorporate diverse theological constructions, including virtue development and promoting human flourishing as understood in non-Western traditions.\n- This multicultural theological inclusiveness can position your method uniquely in addressing pluralistic clinical ethics, improving its novelty, acceptance, and relevance in global healthcare AI deployment.\n- Further, consider embedding user preferences and patient values aligned with these theological ethical frameworks to personalize moral reasoning transparency layers. \n\nThis global integration will enhance both impact and technical novelty, addressing the competitive landscape with distinctive cross-cultural ethical transparency.\n\nSection: Motivation"
