    "title": "Cross-Modal Contextual Analysis for Scalable Adversarial Defense",
    "Problem_Statement": "Adversarial training approaches struggle to scale to the dynamic and naturalistic customer interactions due to lack of integration of multi-modal and global context information.",
    "Motivation": "Leveraging global context cues and multi-modal signals (e.g., audio tone, visual cues) offers a novel direction to enhance scalability and robustness, addressing internal scalability gaps and external cross-disciplinary potential.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-modal LLM framework integrating textual inputs with voice emotion features and interaction provenance metadata to enhance adversarial detection and recovery. The system learns contextual embeddings that detect subtle adversarial patterns beyond text. Recovery strategies dynamically adjust based on enriched context understanding, improving defense scalability across diverse channels.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multi-modal customer interaction datasets including text and audio.\n2) Train multi-modal encoders fused with LLM dialogue systems.\n3) Implement adversarial training augmented with contextual anomaly detection.\n4) Baselines include text-only adversarially trained models.\n5) Metrics: adversarial detection accuracy, recovery success, user engagement retention.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user uses sarcastic tone combined with misleading text.\nExpected output: The system detects adversarial intent by analyzing tone and text inconsistency and triggers robust recovery strategies.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-modal data is sparse, simulate audio features or focus on metadata-driven context augmentation."

          "feedback_content": "While the idea of integrating multi-modal inputs (text, voice emotion, provenance metadata) into a large language model (LLM) framework for adversarial detection is promising, the proposal lacks specific detail on how these heterogeneous data types will be fused and how their joint embeddings will reliably capture subtle adversarial cues. Clear architectural design choices, fusion strategies (early, late, or hybrid), and modeling of temporal or interaction context are needed to assess soundness. Strengthening this will improve confidence that the proposed mechanism can effectively detect nuanced adversarial signals beyond text alone, rather than being a superficial multimodal extension without theoretical justification or prior proof-of-concept rationale. I recommend elaborating on the model fusion design and providing pilot studies or references for feasibility of such contextual embeddings for adversarial tasks to enhance clarity and plausibility of the proposed method’s mechanism and distinct contribution to adversarial robustness research. This will help differentiate this work in the competitive landscape noted in novelty screening."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE status and the existing strong links between multi-modal approaches and adversarial detection, there is an opportunity to enhance impact and novelty by integrating concepts from 'vision-language models' or 'federated learning' from the globally linked concepts. For example, extending the framework to leverage vision-language fusion models could enrich contextual understanding beyond text and audio—adding visual customer cues improves robustness, broadening applicability to more naturalistic interactions. Furthermore, exploring federated learning approaches might address data sparsity and privacy concerns in multi-modal customer interactions while improving scalability and deployment feasibility across distributed systems. Including such integrations as a complementary research direction or module could significantly elevate the work’s originality and broaden its interest across cyber-physical or IoV settings, thus addressing known challenges in current adversarial defense and making the approach more impactful and competitive."
