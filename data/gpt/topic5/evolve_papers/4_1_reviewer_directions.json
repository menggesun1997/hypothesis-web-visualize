    "title": "Sustainable Ethical Fine-Tuning Framework Incorporating ESG Metrics in Legal AI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Fine-tuning large language models for legal document analysis traditionally focuses on text accuracy and domain adaptation, neglecting the integration of ethical, sustainability, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) considerations vital for socially responsible AI deployment, potentially perpetuating biases and overlooking non-financial compliance issues.",
    "Motivation": "Aligning with the external critical gap, this research introduces sustainability and ethical AI governance principles drawn from commerce and management literature into the fine-tuning process for legal LLMs. By embedding ESG-related contextual features, the approach mitigates bias and enhances alignment with global corporate responsibility standards, a currently unexplored domain that bridges AI, legal tech, and ethical governance.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a fine-tuning pipeline that augments legal datasets with ESG annotations derived from sustainable finance and compliance reports. Train multi-objective models that balance legal accuracy with ESG compliance metrics using custom loss functions reflecting fairness, transparency, and ethical standards. Integrate explainability modules tracing ESG influence on model outputs. Use federated learning approaches to preserve sensitive data privacy across organizational boundaries while embedding ethical norms.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect and annotate legal documents with ESG-relevant tags, including bias indicators and sustainability compliance flags. 2. Develop multi-task learning architectures incorporating these ESG tasks alongside legal understanding. 3. Fine-tune baseline LLMs with the ESG-annotated corpus. 4. Measure performance on legal accuracy, bias metrics (e.g., demographic parity), and ESG compliance score alignment. 5. Conduct user studies with legal practitioners and compliance officers for qualitative validation. 6. Test federated fine-tuning across simulated organizational data silos.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Company policy documents with terms influencing employee rights and environmental impact. Expected output: An analysis highlighting legal compliance points alongside ESG considerations, flagging unethical clauses or sustainability risks, accompanied by explanation of ethical decisions informed by ESG embeddings.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-objective optimization deteriorates legal task performance, separate training phases can fine-tune for ESG compliance post-legal fine-tuning. Alternatively, utilize prompt augmentation strategies embedding ESG context without modifying core model weights to integrate ethical filters dynamically."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section describes an ambitious multi-objective fine-tuning approach combining legal accuracy with ESG compliance metrics, using custom loss functions and explainability modules. However, the mechanism lacks concrete detail on how ESG annotations are quantitatively integrated into both the dataset and loss function design, and how conflicts between legal accuracy and ESG objectives are balanced during training. Clarifying the architecture—e.g., whether ESG is treated as auxiliary tasks or directly embedded features—and specifying how ethical norms are codified and embedded would improve soundness and reproducibility. Detailing explainability approaches that concretely link ESG influence to output is also needed to avoid vague claims and better justify the approach's novelty and validity in this complex setting. This refinement will strengthen the theoretical foundation and help reviewers assess feasibility and impact more confidently. Targeting modeling design choices explicitly will clarify core assumptions and mechanisms, addressing critical soundness concerns in multi-objective ethical AI deployment in legal NLP contexts. The authors are encouraged to incorporate these clarifications before proceeding further with experiments or impact claims, to ensure the proposed framework is conceptually sound and methodologically rigorous.  Suggestions include providing pseudocode, model diagrams, or formal definitions of ESG integration into the loss or model representation space to concretize the fine-tuning pipeline design and its explainability components. This will also help scope the problem clearly and avoid overselling the ESG embedding mechanism that remains high-level now.  \n\n(Section targeted: Proposed_Method)  \n  \n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty screening result of NOV-COMPETITIVE, the idea would benefit from deeper integration with relevant domain-specific contexts to boost impact and distinctiveness. A promising enhancement is to explicitly incorporate insights and datasets from Singapore Management University’s sustainability and corporate social responsibility research, as well as actual ESG compliance and environmental disclosure records from jurisdictions like Spanish companies or investment funds known for ESG reporting. This integration can ground the ESG annotations and legal contexts within real-world compliance frameworks, improving authenticity and applicability. Moreover, leveraging Robotic Process Automation could be proposed as a complementary tool to operationalize the flagged ESG-legal gaps in compliance workflows, increasing practical significance for legal professionals and corporate law practitioners. Aligning with passive funds and return on investment concerns within ethical finance could broaden the impact and industrial relevance of the framework, positioning the work at the intersection of legal AI, sustainable finance, and governance. This will help push the contribution beyond competitive foundational methods towards uniquely actionable innovations interfacing ESG principles in legal fine-tuning pipelines for socially responsible AI systems. The authors should concretely map out these cross-domain linkages and datasets in a revised proposal to amplify novelty and relevance.  \n\n(Section targeted: Motivation and Proposed_Method)"
