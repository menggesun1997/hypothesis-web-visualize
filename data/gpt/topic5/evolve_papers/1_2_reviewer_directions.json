    "title": "Narrative Ethical Auditing Toolkit for Cultural Bias Mitigation in Clinical AI Outputs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Conventional fairness metrics fail to capture socio-cultural biases and stigmatization embedded in healthcare AI outputs, hindering truly equitable patient-centered care.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external gap relating to the integration of narrative ethics and performing arts into AI fairness assessment, translating abstract theatrical concepts into practical bias auditing tools.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a narrative-based ethical auditing toolkit that converts LLM-generated clinical outputs into structured narratives resembling stage scripts. Utilizing theatrical frameworks such as character motivation analysis and scene staging metaphors, the toolkit identifies hidden bias triggers and moral dissonance. The tool applies computational narrative mining algorithms aligned with equity-focused ethical principles to generate culture-sensitive fairness scores and actionable revision recommendations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble a corpus of healthcare dialogues and discharge notes annotated for cultural biases and stigmatization. 2) Develop narrative conversion pipelines mapping text to narrative structures informed by theatrical models. 3) Implement bias detection algorithms highlighting problematic 'characters' (entities), 'plots' (clinical courses), and 'acts' (decision sequences). 4) Validate the toolkit against traditional fairness metrics and clinician cultural competency assessments.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient discharge summary referencing adherence likelihood. The toolkit reveals implicit blame themes potentially stigmatizing minority groups, suggesting alternative phrasing that reduces cultural bias while preserving clinical meaning.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If theatrical narrative mapping struggles at scale, fallback to simpler narrative schematization methods from computational linguistics and progressively incorporate theatrical insights supported by human expert review."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method innovatively uses theatrical narrative frameworks for bias detection in clinical AI outputs; however, the mapping from LLM-generated clinical text to structured stage-like narratives and their subsequent computational analysis is insufficiently detailed. Clarify the specific algorithms or models used for narrative mining, how theatrical concepts like character motivations and scene staging will be quantitatively encoded, and how these translate into actionable bias detection and revision suggestions. Strengthen the explanation to ensure the mechanism is not only novel but also operationally clear and justifiable to both AI and clinical ethics experts, reinforcing trust in the tool’s outputs and recommendations from a sound methodological basis that bridges humanities and AI rigorously rather than metaphorically alone, which is critical for acceptance and reproducibility in healthcare AI auditing. This enhanced clarity and rigor will improve confidence in the soundness of the core method and its ethical premise, making the innovation credible and more implementable for reviewers and practitioners alike. The current description risks being perceived as high-level conceptual without concrete computational grounding needed for this domain’s high-stakes context (clinical fairness auditing)."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines thoughtful phases including corpus assembly, narrative conversion, bias detection, and validation, but lacks detailed feasibility considerations for key challenges that threaten practical implementation. Specifically, annotating cultural bias and stigmatization in healthcare dialogues requires robust definition criteria, diverse and representative data spanning multiple cultural backgrounds, and expert linguistic and ethical annotation—explain how these complexities will be addressed. The transition from textual clinical data to theatrical narrative structures raises questions about scalability, consistency, and inter-rater reliability of mappings; propose concrete evaluation protocols or pilot studies to validate this narrative conversion step before full pipeline deployment. Additionally, the plan to benchmark against standard fairness metrics and clinician cultural competency assessments is valuable but underspecified: outline which metrics, how alignment or divergence will be interpreted, and how human-in-the-loop validation will be structured. Addressing these items will substantiate the experiment's scientific soundness and practicability, ensuring the research is not only conceptually innovative but also actionable and empirically verifiable in a reasonable timeframe required for clinical impact."
