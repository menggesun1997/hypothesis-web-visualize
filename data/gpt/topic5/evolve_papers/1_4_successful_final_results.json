    "Problem_Statement": "Transparency in moral reasoning of LLM outputs in clinical decision support remains limited, obscuring trustworthy ethical alignment.",
    "Motivation": "Targets internal ethical transparency gap by integrating formal theological ethical ontologies into LLM reasoning processes, pioneering transparent moral explanation layers.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a middleware transparency layer that extracts LLM-generated clinical decisions and systematically maps them onto formal ontologies derived from theological ethical frameworks (e.g., virtue ethics, deontological principles). This mapping produces human-readable moral reasoning chains and conflict flags, enabling clinicians to trace ethical rationales and detect normativity failures or toxic degeneration risks.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collaborate with ethicists to formalize theological ethical ontologies codified in knowledge graphs. 2) Develop interfaces translating LLM outputs into ontology-driven moral reasoning chains. 3) Pilot with clinical decision tasks involving ethical dilemmas, comparing transparency and trust against standard explanations. 4) Assess clinician understanding, moral certainty, and fairness outcomes.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Treatment plan for end-of-life care involving patient autonomy. The layer outputs a mapped reasoning trail citing principles like 'respect for autonomy' and 'do no harm,' highlighting conflicts and supporting clinician reflection.",

        "title": "Multicultural Theological Ethical Ontologies for Transparent Moral Reasoning in Healthcare AI",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current clinical AI decision support systems lack transparent, trustworthy moral reasoning explanations that reflect the pluralistic, culturally diverse ethical landscape of healthcare, hindering clinician trust and ethical alignment with diverse patient values.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing a critical transparency gap, this research integrates globally-relevant, culturally inclusive theological ethical frameworks—including Western virtue ethics and deontological principles alongside underexplored traditions such as Islamic ethics and theology of life—into AI moral reasoning explanations. By embedding multicultural ethical constructs emphasizing the development of virtues and promoting human flourishing, and aligning with patient values and user preferences, this novel multilayered moral reasoning transparency aims to surpass current uni-cultural approaches and hard-to-interpret AI ethics models, providing a distinctive, globally relevant contribution to ethical AI deployment in healthcare.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a rigorously scoped middleware transparency layer that translates LLM-generated clinical decisions into systematically mapped moral reasoning chains grounded in a suite of formalized, quality-controlled ethical ontologies derived from diverse theological traditions (e.g., Western virtue ethics, Islamic ethical constructs, theology of life). The methodology includes: (1) a principled ontology selection and reconciliation protocol addressing conflicts between pluralistic theological doctrines and secular medical ethics to ensure clinical applicability and legal compliance; (2) multimodal symbolic-neural hybrid translation mechanisms that combine ontology fragments with LLM moral direction embeddings, allowing flexible yet principled moral reasoning extraction; and (3) incorporation of patient and clinician user preferences to personalize transparency outputs. This approach explicitly embraces cross-cultural moral pluralism, resolving potential conflicts through layered ontology governance and conflict resolution strategies, ultimately producing clear, human-readable ethical reasoning trails that highlight value tensions and support clinician reflection on fairness and ethical certainty.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collaborate extensively with ethicists, theologians from diverse traditions, knowledge engineers, and healthcare legal experts to formalize and harmonize theological ethical ontologies into interoperable knowledge graphs, guided by rigorous scope, quality control, and conflict reconciliation protocols; 2) Develop and validate hybrid symbolic-neural interfaces to reliably translate LLM clinical decision outputs into structured moral reasoning chains, employing automated interpretability verification metrics comparing generated chains with expert-annotated ground truths; 3) Design and pilot clinical decision support tasks featuring ethically challenging scenarios involving diverse patient populations; 4) Employ validated, standardized instruments to quantitatively measure clinician understanding (e.g., comprehension quizzes), moral certainty (e.g., established moral confidence scales), and perceived fairness (e.g., fairness perception surveys), contrasting outcomes against baseline models with conventional explanation approaches; 5) Iteratively refine ontology integration and user preference incorporation based on clinician feedback and measured outcomes to optimize trust and ethical alignment.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An end-of-life care treatment plan challenging patient autonomy balanced against communal welfare principles. The transparency layer maps the LLM’s decision onto theological principles such as 'respect for autonomy' (Western), 'maslahah' (public interest in Islamic ethics), and 'sanctity of life' (theology of life), explicitly highlighting resulting value tensions and moral trade-offs, producing a user-personalized ethical reasoning trail. This enables clinicians to trace and reflect on the ethical justifications, reconcile conflicting norms, and align care decisions with culturally sensitive, legally compliant standards.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should formal ontology mapping prove intractably rigid or slow to operationalize, fallback to a flexible hybrid symbolic-neural framework prioritizing automated moral direction embeddings derived from corpora of annotated ethical clinical cases across diverse traditions. This approach will integrate partial ontology fragments to maintain principled moral grounding while enabling scalable, adaptive transparency outputs that can incorporate evolving ethical guidelines and patient preference profiles."

          "feedback_content": "The foundational assumption that theological ethical ontologies can be consistently and unambiguously formalized and integrated into LLM outputs for clinical reasoning requires deeper justification. Ethical frameworks from theology often encompass diverse, sometimes conflicting doctrines and interpretations that may not translate cleanly into formal ontologies. Clarify how you will resolve ontology conflicts or pluralism arising from multiple theological traditions, especially in diverse clinical contexts. Without this, the transparency layer risks propagating confusion rather than alleviating it in ethical decision-making processes, potentially undermining trust rather than enhancing it. More explicit scope or limits on which theological traditions or ethical constructs will be encoded can improve conceptual soundness and applicability of the approach in healthcare AI contexts that are broadly acceptable and legally compliant, rather than narrowly theological or doctrinal. This is crucial given the complex and pluralistic moral landscape in real-world clinical settings, especially considering patient autonomy and cultural diversity evident in the problem statement and test cases.  \n\nRecommendations:\n- Integrate a rigorous method for selecting and reconciling ontologies\n- Explicitly address handling conflicts or ambiguities in ethical principles\n- Address potential tensions between theological ethics and secular medical ethics to ensure legal and institutional compatibility. This will reinforce the assumption's validity and the method's foundational robustness. \n\nSection: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "While the experiment plan outlines critical multidisciplinary collaboration and pilot validation with clinicians, the feasibility concerns emerge regarding the complexity and measurability of key outcomes.\n\n1) Formalizing theological ethical ontologies into knowledge graphs is a non-trivial task requiring extensive input from ethicists, theologians, and knowledge engineers. It may be both time-consuming and difficult to operationalize in a consistent format suitable for seamless LLM integration.\n\n2) Translating LLM outputs accurately into ontology-driven moral reasoning chains needs a robust interpretability mechanism, which also requires verification and validation. It is unclear how this translation will be automated or evaluated beyond anecdotal or qualitative assessments.\n\n3) The pilot involving ethical dilemmas and clinician evaluation proposes assessing \"moral certainty\" and \"fairness outcomes,\" which are complex constructs to operationally define and measure reliably. Clear metrics, control baselines, and validated instruments must be described to ensure scientific rigor.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Include detailed methodological plans for ontology engineering, including scope, guidelines, and quality control measures.\n- Develop a quantitative or semi-quantitative method for evaluating moral reasoning chain correctness and clinician trust.\n- Specify precise instruments and criteria for measuring clinician understanding, moral certainty, and fairness to enhance experiment practicability and replicability.\n\nSection: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
