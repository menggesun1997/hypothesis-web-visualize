        "title": "Hybrid Multi-Agent Consensus Framework for Hallucination Detection in Financial LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs in financial advisory often hallucinate or produce inaccurate information, undermining trust and risking regulatory compliance. Existing methods insufficiently detect and mitigate hallucinations within domain-specific contexts where expert knowledge is critical.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical internal gap of reliable hallucination detection under financial constraints by leveraging a novel hybrid multi-agent consensus framework combining domain expert systems, multiple LLM instances, and rule-based validators to cross-verify outputs, ensuring higher factual consistency and trustworthiness.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a system where multiple specialized LLMs produce advisory outputs independently. These outputs are then verified by a symbolic finance knowledge engine encoded with domain rules and regulations. A consensus algorithm aggregates the outputs, flags deviations, and uses explainable AI to highlight potential hallucinations. Mistakes detected trigger an adaptive retraining loop with domain-specific corrective feedback.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble financial datasets and regulatory documents; 2) Fine-tune multiple LLM variants on financial advice; 3) Build symbolic finance knowledge base for verification; 4) Implement consensus and hallucination scoring mechanism; 5) Compare with baselines (single LLM, heuristic checks) using accuracy, hallucination rates, and explainability metrics; 6) Perform user studies assessing trust/satisfaction.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Suggest investment in company XYZ, which has shown 25% growth last quarter.' Expected: Consensus output includes verification that the 25% growth is based on authentic quarterly reports; flagged hallucinations if data unsupported by financial filings.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If consensus fails due to conflicting outputs, fallback to a human-in-the-loop review step or incorporate probabilistic uncertainty estimates to defer unclear recommendations."

        "title": "ESG-Augmented Financial LLM with Sustainability Fact-Checker",
        "Problem_Statement": "Financial LLMs rarely incorporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics, leading to advisory outputs that overlook sustainability risks and misinform investors focused on responsible investment.",
        "Motivation": "This idea exploits the external gap of integrating ESG and non-financial metrics into financial LLM advisory systems, pioneering a novel model architecture that fuses conventional financial data and dynamic ESG indicators to enhance output accuracy and trustworthiness.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a dual-stream neural architecture where one stream processes traditional financial data and the other ingests ESG datasets (e.g., real-time carbon footprint, labor practices). A specialized cross-attention mechanism reconciles these streams to inform investment advice. An ESG fact-checking module validates claims against a live sustainability database to detect misinformation.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect paired financial and ESG datasets; 2) Train baseline financial LLM and ESG-augmented LLM; 3) Evaluate advice quality using financial return accuracy and ESG consistency metrics; 4) Conduct case studies illustrating ESG influence on advice; 5) Measure user trust and decision-making improvements.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Recommend companies with strong financial growth and low environmental impact.' Expect advice highlighting firms with verified ESG scores alongside financial growth, with ESG claims fact-checked for accuracy.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If integration degrades financial prediction accuracy, iteratively adjust weighting in dual-stream model or use modular gating to selectively incorporate ESG data only when confidence is high."

        "title": "Blockchain-Enabled Transparent Audit Trail for AI-Driven Financial Advice",
        "Problem_Statement": "The opaqueness of LLM-generated financial advice hinders regulatory compliance and user trust due to the lack of auditable, tamper-proof explanation and provenance tracking.",
        "Motivation": "By bridging finance AI with blockchain-based transparency tools (an external gap), this project aims to develop an immutable audit trail for AI advisories, improving ethical adoption, compliance verification, and organizational trust frameworks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a hybrid system where every AI-generated financial advisory output is hashed and stored on a permissioned blockchain alongside metadata detailing data sources, rationale keywords, and explainability reports derived from model attention logs. Financial institutions can query this ledger for compliance audits or dispute resolution, reinforcing accountability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop LLM advisory system with explainability output; 2) Implement blockchain ledger prototype using Hyperledger Fabric; 3) Integrate automatic recording of advisory metadata; 4) Test latency, scalability, and security; 5) Conduct pilot usage scenarios with compliance officers evaluating audit utility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Advice to invest in fund ABC due to projected growth. Blockchain ledger entry shows data origin, model attention highlights on key financial indicators, timestamp, and unique hash ensuring immutability.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain integration proves too resource-intensive, fallback to cryptographically signed off-chain logs with periodic blockchain anchoring for a balance between transparency and efficiency."

        "title": "Cross-Domain Explainability Framework Leveraging Neurosymbolic AI for Financial Advisory LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLMs struggle with explainability in complex financial domains; users and regulators require transparent justifications of advice to build trust and meet compliance.",
        "Motivation": "Responding to internal gaps in explainability and hallucination correction, this research proposes merging neurosymbolic AI—combining symbolic reasoning with neural methods—to generate logically structured, human-understandable explanations aligned with financial regulations.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Integrate symbolic finance ontologies with neural LLM embeddings via a neurosymbolic pipeline that parses advice into logical rules. The system visualizes reasoning paths and identifies hallucinated content by checking rule consistency with financial knowledge bases, enabling targeted corrections and explainable outputs.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Create a symbolic ontology for finance advisory reasoning; 2) Develop interface layers between LLM and symbolic reasoner; 3) Train with datasets annotated for reasoning steps; 4) Evaluate fidelity and clarity of explanations via expert assessment; 5) Benchmark hallucination detection accuracy compared to standard LLM outputs.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Recommend bond investment due to low risk and stable returns.' Output includes a symbolic chain outlining risk assessment rules, historical default rates, and regulatory compliance validations supporting the recommendation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If neurosymbolic integration is insufficient, apply post-hoc explanation methods or focus on modular explainers for specific financial subdomains."

        "title": "Adaptive Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Multi-Institutional Financial Advisory LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Gathering diverse private financial data for training LLMs risks breaching privacy and limits model generalizability due to siloed data and domain expertise disparities.",
        "Motivation": "This idea tackles internal gaps around data privacy and generalizability by proposing a federated learning framework tailored for financial LLMs that adaptively balances local privacy, global model performance, and domain adaptation through personalized training and differential privacy safeguards.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a federated LLM training system where multiple financial institutions collaboratively update a global model without sharing raw data. Introduce adaptive personalization layers that fine-tune outputs to local domain expertise, enhanced with differential privacy to certify data protection. Model updates include hallucination evaluation feedback loops.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Partner with multiple institutions providing sanctioned datasets; 2) Implement federated training protocols with privacy guarantees; 3) Measure model performance on institution-specific vs. global tasks; 4) Assess hallucination rates pre- and post-personalization; 5) Benchmark against centralized training baselines.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Scenario: Institution A trains locally on unique bond market data; global model reflects combined knowledge without exposing private details. Output tailored to institution A's data patterns with fewer hallucinations relative to generic model.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated approach impairs model convergence, investigate hybrid centralized-federated methods or optimize privacy-utility trade-offs further."

        "title": "Multi-Modal Financial Advisory Framework Incorporating Real-Time News and Social Sentiment for Misinformation Detection",
        "Problem_Statement": "Financial LLMs relying solely on static training data risk hallucinations and outdated or misleading advice, especially given volatile market news and social sentiment dynamics.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the internal gap in hallucination detection, this project integrates multi-modal data streams—real-time financial news, social media sentiment, and structured market data—to dynamically validate and correct LLM advice, reducing misinformation risks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Build a pipeline that fuses LLM outputs with sentiment analysis modules analyzing live news and social media (Twitter, financial forums). Discrepancies between advisory claims and emerging sentiment triggers re-assessment or user alerts. Employ contrastive learning to align multi-modal signals with advisory truths.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect financial news, social media sentiment, and LLM outputs; 2) Develop sentiment analysis and anomaly detection modules; 3) Integrate with LLM advisory system; 4) Evaluate misinformation detection accuracy and real-time performance against static LLM baselines; 5) Conduct user trust and timeliness studies.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Company Q is seeing steady growth.' If live sentiment or news reports negative developments, system flags potential hallucination and provides updated advisory or cautionary note.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If live data integration is noisy or slow, fallback to periodic batch updating of advisory models or weighted reliance on structured financial indicators."

        "Problem_Statement": "Investors’ risk perceptions increasingly consider green innovation and sustainability, yet financial LLMs do not model these subjective factors, limiting personalized, trustworthy advice.",
        "Motivation": "By combining AI governance, green innovation, and investor psychology (a novel external gap), this research aims to develop personalized, explainable advisory models that incorporate green innovation signals to better model and communicate risk tailored to investor preferences.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design an LLM augmented with investor profile embeddings encoding risk aversion and sustainability priorities. Integrate green innovation indexes as features influencing advice generation. Employ explainability layers that transparently link green factors to risk assessments and recommendations.",
