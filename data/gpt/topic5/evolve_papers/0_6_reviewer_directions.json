    "title": "Investor Risk Perception Modeling using Explainable LLMs with Green Innovation Indicators",
    "Problem_Statement": "Investors’ risk perceptions increasingly consider green innovation and sustainability, yet financial LLMs do not model these subjective factors, limiting personalized, trustworthy advice.",
    "Motivation": "By combining AI governance, green innovation, and investor psychology (a novel external gap), this research aims to develop personalized, explainable advisory models that incorporate green innovation signals to better model and communicate risk tailored to investor preferences.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an LLM augmented with investor profile embeddings encoding risk aversion and sustainability priorities. Integrate green innovation indexes as features influencing advice generation. Employ explainability layers that transparently link green factors to risk assessments and recommendations.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect investor risk profile data and green innovation metrics; 2) Train multi-input model combining profiles and financial data; 3) Evaluate advice relevance, accuracy, and perceived trustworthiness with user studies; 4) Test explainability effectiveness regarding green factors; 5) Compare to generic advisory models.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Profile indicates high sustainability preference; advice recommends investments in companies pioneering renewable energy tech, with explanations connecting green innovation to anticipated reduced long-term risk.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If personalized input data sparse, fallback to unsupervised clustering of investor types or semi-personalized advice using demographic proxies."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that existing financial LLMs inadequately incorporate investors' subjective sustainability preferences and green innovation signals requires stronger empirical foundation. The proposal should more explicitly justify why modeling green innovation indicators alongside psychological investor profiles substantially improves trustworthiness and personalization over existing financial advisory systems, which increasingly integrate ESG factors. Clarifying this assumption with citations or preliminary analyses would strengthen soundness and motivate the design choices better, preventing underestimation of existing models' capabilities or overselling novelty in a competitive domain familiar with ESG incorporation methods. Suggest including a brief literature grounding that critically assesses current gaps in explanation and personalization around green innovation in financial LLMs to validate this foundational premise adequately within the Problem_Statement and Motivation sections, reinforcing the rationale for the proposed integration approach while reducing risks of redundant effort given the competitive environment of this research area in financial economics and AI governance contexts. This will align stakeholders’ expectations about the realistic incremental value of the method and ensure sound base assumptions for downstream modeling steps and experiments planning without losing novelty or feasibility focus. Target refinement here aids clarity and impact potential measured by downstream user trust and acceptance in advisory outputs tailored to sustainability preferences, the core contribution theme of the work. This is critical given the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating and the well-developed landscape of financial AI models incorporating sustainability factors today.  Recommend to revise Problem_Statement and Motivation accordingly with focused justification including specific green innovation indicators' insufficiency in existing LLM advisory explanations and personalization capabilities, explicitly tying to investor psychology variables as a unique external gap to be bridged for trustworthy advice generation tailored to green investment preferences.  \n\nFurthermore, explicit reasoning about how the investor profile embeddings will effectively encode risk aversion and sustainability priorities should be articulated, ensuring that these embeddings realistically capture meaningful individual differences relevant to risk modeling and investment decision explanations, given the complexity and subjectivity of these concepts. These assumptions drive the mechanism downstream and thus must be made transparent and justified in the Proposal_Method section as well, possibly supported by prior psychological or behavioral financial studies on investor heterogeneity that can then be computationally represented in AI models for personalized outputs. Without these details, feasibility and soundness suffer, and reviewers may question methodological grounding and validity of the model design and its explainability layers' interpretability claims. A clearer chain of reasoning from assumptions through to the explainability approach ensures intellectual rigor and better positions the work for acceptance and impactful contribution in the field."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan requires elaboration and strengthening to demonstrate practical feasibility and scientific rigor in evaluating the proposed complex model combining heterogeneous data types (investor profiles and green innovation indicators) through LLM extensions with explainability layers. First, data collection plans need details on sourcing comprehensive, high-quality investor risk profile data encompassing sustainability preferences, and green innovation indexes with temporal and sectoral granularity. Without clear access to representative datasets, the training and evaluation steps risk being infeasible or unrepresentative. Second, the methodological approach for multi-input model training combining embeddings and external data should clarify architectural choices, optimization objectives, and how explainability modules integrate technically with the LLM to ensure interpretable causal links from green factors to risk outputs rather than heuristic associations. Third, the planned user studies evaluating advice relevance, accuracy, trustworthiness, and explainability effectiveness are ambitious but underspecified: defining participant recruitment criteria, study designs (e.g., within-subject comparisons), metrics, and statistical analyses is crucial. Fourth, fallback plans based on unsupervised clustering or demographic proxies imply a drastic methodological shift; integrating this fallback robustly into the overall experimental logic and evaluation metrics is needed to meaningfully assess performance degradation and utility. Finally, the comparison with generic advisory models should clarify baseline selections, benchmarking protocols, and reveal expected effect sizes or performance gains hypothesized. Incorporating these elaborations ensures the experiment plan is scientifically sound, practically executable, and aligned with claimed evaluation dimensions critical for demonstrating impact in a competitive research area. It will also help reviewers and stakeholders gauge expected timelines, resource needs, and result interpretability reliability, thus increasing confidence in the feasibility and ultimate contribution of this research project."
