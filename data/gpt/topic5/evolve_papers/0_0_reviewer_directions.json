    "title": "Hybrid Multi-Agent Consensus Framework for Hallucination Detection in Financial LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs in financial advisory often hallucinate or produce inaccurate information, undermining trust and risking regulatory compliance. Existing methods insufficiently detect and mitigate hallucinations within domain-specific contexts where expert knowledge is critical.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical internal gap of reliable hallucination detection under financial constraints by leveraging a novel hybrid multi-agent consensus framework combining domain expert systems, multiple LLM instances, and rule-based validators to cross-verify outputs, ensuring higher factual consistency and trustworthiness.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a system where multiple specialized LLMs produce advisory outputs independently. These outputs are then verified by a symbolic finance knowledge engine encoded with domain rules and regulations. A consensus algorithm aggregates the outputs, flags deviations, and uses explainable AI to highlight potential hallucinations. Mistakes detected trigger an adaptive retraining loop with domain-specific corrective feedback.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble financial datasets and regulatory documents; 2) Fine-tune multiple LLM variants on financial advice; 3) Build symbolic finance knowledge base for verification; 4) Implement consensus and hallucination scoring mechanism; 5) Compare with baselines (single LLM, heuristic checks) using accuracy, hallucination rates, and explainability metrics; 6) Perform user studies assessing trust/satisfaction.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Suggest investment in company XYZ, which has shown 25% growth last quarter.' Expected: Consensus output includes verification that the 25% growth is based on authentic quarterly reports; flagged hallucinations if data unsupported by financial filings.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If consensus fails due to conflicting outputs, fallback to a human-in-the-loop review step or incorporate probabilistic uncertainty estimates to defer unclear recommendations."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a compelling hybrid consensus framework but lacks detailed clarification on the consensus algorithm specifics—such as criteria for agreement thresholds, conflict resolution strategies, and how explainable AI components mechanistically pinpoint hallucinations. Elaborating these mechanisms will strengthen soundness by showing feasibility of operationalizing the multi-agent verification and its adaptive retraining feedback loops in realistic, domain-specific settings within financial regulatory constraints. Providing concrete design choices or pseudocode for key components will clarify implementation viability under complex financial semantics and compliance requirements, preventing ambiguity in how outputs are aggregated and errors are detected or adjudicated between agents and symbolic knowledge checks, crucial for trustworthiness claims in high-stakes environments like finance. Targeting Proposed_Method for refinement will markedly enhance reproducibility and anticipatory robustness of the approach in practice, bolstering reviewer confidence in the core technical feasibility and soundness of the submission."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the idea’s novelty is rated NOV-COMPETITIVE, to elevate impact and novelty it is recommended to integrate concepts from 'intent-based networking' or 'process mining' to dynamically adapt the consensus framework based on evolving user intent or regulatory shifts in the financial domain. For example, embedding an intent-driven orchestration layer could allow the multi-agent system to prioritize agents or knowledge validators corresponding to real-time regulatory updates or transaction patterns extracted via process mining. This would enhance system agility in identifying hallucinations aligned to current compliance contexts, improving both accuracy and trust dynamically. Additionally, leveraging recent advances in 'generation of synthetic datasets' can strengthen the adaptive retraining loop by augmenting rare or outlier financial cases, improving detection coverage beyond historical data. Such integration would make the framework more robust and forward-looking, positioning it beyond static ensemble verification towards a self-aware, context-adaptive hallucination detection architecture, potentially setting new state-of-the-art standards in safe LLM deployment in finance."
