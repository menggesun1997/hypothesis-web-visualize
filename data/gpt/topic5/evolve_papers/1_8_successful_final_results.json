        "title": "Federated Adaptive Ethical Prompt Engineering with Human-in-the-Loop Oversight for Context-Sensitive Bias Mitigation in Healthcare LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Standard few-shot learning and static prompt engineering approaches fail to dynamically adjust to evolving clinical context biases and ethical requirements, limiting bias mitigation and ethical compliance effectiveness in healthcare large language models (LLMs). Moreover, existing methods lack scalability across institutions and robust real-time ethical oversight, creating barriers to trustworthy deployment.",
        "Motivation": "This work addresses technical and ethical gaps in adaptive prompt engineering by introducing a novel federated learning framework combined with structured human-in-the-loop mechanisms for continuous, context-sensitive moral feedback. By enabling privacy-preserving collaboration across multiple health systems and integrating real-time clinician ethical oversight, we propose a fundamentally novel approach that enhances adaptability, ethical rigor, and deployment feasibility in clinical AI applicationsâ€”surpassing existing static or single-institution bias mitigation efforts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Our method consists of a federated adaptive prompt generation architecture that synthesizes diverse, potentially conflicting ethical signals from multiple clinical sites without sharing sensitive patient data. We explicitly model ethical feedback as multi-dimensional embeddings derived from clinician annotations and real-time moral direction inputs, integrated through a conflict-aware aggregation module using weighted consensus algorithms and attention-based fusion. This module continuously updates prompt generation policies conditioned on clinical context features and aggregated ethical directives. A structured human-in-the-loop framework governs ongoing annotation, validation, and refinement of ethical signals, ensuring accountability and clinical relevance. The federated learning protocol enables distributed training of the prompt generator across participating institutions, preserving privacy while enhancing model generalization. This integrated system enables dynamic, context-aware, and ethically grounded prompt adaptation, improving fairness and minimizing toxic degeneration risks in healthcare LLM outputs.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collaborate with multiple health systems to collect annotated datasets with diverse clinical contexts and documented bias issues under privacy constraints. 2) Develop and validate the ethical feedback embedding space and multi-source aggregation mechanism, including conflict-resolution through weighted consensus and attention layers. 3) Implement the federated prompt generation training pipeline to securely aggregate model updates, preserving data privacy. 4) Establish a human-in-the-loop oversight protocol involving clinicians for continuous annotation, model validation, and ethical feedback refinement. 5) Conduct comprehensive evaluations across clinical scenarios assessing bias reduction, output quality, adaptability, privacy preservation, and clinician acceptance using metrics aligned with ethical and fairness standards. 6) Perform ablation studies to quantify the contributions of federated learning, aggregation mechanism, and human-in-the-loop components.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Scenario: Cardiology consultation prompt input from Institution A incorporating demographic bias concerns; simultaneously, an endocrinology scenario at Institution B raises distinct ethical considerations. The federated adaptive prompt system aggregates real-time ethical signals from both sites, reconciling conflicting constraints via its conflict-aware fusion module. The adaptive engine dynamically generates context-specific prompts customized per institution, embedding ethical constraints such as demographic fairness and clinical nuance. Human-in-the-loop clinicians validate outputs, further refining feedback signals. This results in LLM responses that are tailored, context-aware, equitable, and acceptable across diverse clinical settings despite data privacy and ethical complexity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the federated adaptive prompting system encounters robustness or convergence issues, we will incorporate reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) targeting stability and fairness rewards to reinforce ethical behavior and bias mitigation. Additionally, a centralized fallback prompt tuning approach integrated with human oversight will be explored to maintain prompt adaptability while ensuring ethical compliance and practical feasibility."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an adaptive prompt generation module guided by continuous moral feedback and clinician annotations. However, the mechanism by which this module integrates diverse and potentially conflicting ethical signals into coherent, context-sensitive prompts is insufficiently detailed. It is critical to clarify the architecture, algorithms, or models used for synthesizing feedback into prompt modifications, including how real-time updates are computed and validated. Without a clear, rigorous explanation, the method risks being underspecified and difficult to reproduce or extend, limiting confidence in its soundness and the practical feasibility of the adaptive prompting approach in complex clinical environments. Further elaboration on the integration strategy and conflict resolution among ethical directives is strongly recommended to strengthen this core component's justification and clarity (Proposed_Method)."

Specifically, employing federated learning would allow the adaptive prompt system to be trained and updated across multiple health systems without compromising patient data privacy, addressing a crucial barrier in healthcare AI deployment. Coupling this with structured human-in-the-loop processes for continuous clinical and ethical oversight can enhance moral feedback reliability and model adaptability.
