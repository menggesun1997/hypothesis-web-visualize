    "title": "Blockchain-Enabled Provenance Tracking for AI Calibration in Legal Workflows",
    "Problem_Statement": "Calibration and fine-tuning of LLMs in legal document analysis lack transparent provenance and traceability, hindering trust and auditability especially when models adapt across different legal domains and jurisdictions. This opacity risks legal compliance failures and limits organizational adoption.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the external gap around blockchain integration, this proposal pioneers combining NLP with decentralized ledger technologies to ensure transparent, immutable tracking of model tuning events, calibration adjustments, and data provenance. It leverages ‘hidden bridge’ insight linking organizational capital modeling with blockchain to enhance trust and governance in AI-driven legal processes.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a hybrid AI-blockchain framework where all calibration steps, dataset versions, model checkpoints, and validation results are logged on a permissioned blockchain network accessible to legal stakeholders. Smart contracts automate governance policies enforcing ethical standards and access controls. The blockchain-backed metadata layer supports reproducible model fine-tuning and enables external audits. Integration APIs link LLM outputs to provenance metadata ensuring end-to-end traceability in workflows.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Develop a prototype permissioned blockchain network tailored for legal AI calibration metadata. 2. Instrument calibration pipelines to emit provenance events to blockchain. 3. Fine-tune LLMs on legal domain data and record fine-tuning metadata immutably. 4. Simulate multi-organizational settings with blockchain-enabled provenance sharing. 5. Evaluate system for transparency, audit efficiency, and user trust via surveys and compliance tests. 6. Benchmark against non-blockchain provenance baselines for performance overhead.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A law firm updating its AI model with new jurisdictional precedents. Expected output: Calibrated model outputs accompanied by blockchain-accessible provenance records detailing data used, calibration parameters, timestamps, and validator signatures, enabling an auditor to verify the process with full traceability.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain integration results in unacceptable latency or complexity, implement hybrid on-chain/off-chain solutions storing critical metadata hashes on-chain with bulk data off-chain. Alternatively, explore cryptographic proof systems (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs) to maintain provenance without full blockchain reliance."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that blockchain integration will meaningfully enhance trust and auditability of AI calibrations in legal workflows, yet it does not convincingly address whether the existing opacity issues stem primarily from provenance gaps or rather from legal and organizational challenges more difficult to solve by technology alone. Clarify and support with evidence why blockchain's immutability and decentralization uniquely solve these trust challenges beyond conventional secure logging methods. This will strengthen the core rationale of the method's foundational assumption and help prioritize research effort effectively within the legal domain constraints and compliance requirements, where confidentiality and access control are critical and complex aspects not only solved by transparency but also by nuanced policy enforcement mechanisms. Consider explicitly acknowledging and discussing potential limitations imposed by legal confidentiality and privacy regulations on permissioned blockchain access models to ensure the assumption's validity and comprehensiveness in real legal settings, as opposed to solely technical perspectives. Addressing this will prevent over-reliance on blockchain properties alone and sharpen the proposal's conceptual soundness regarding its foundational assumptions about provenance and compliance in AI calibration for legal applications."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the 'NOV-COMPETITIVE' classification and the multidisciplinary nature of the proposal, a promising way to enhance both novelty and impact is to integrate emerging techniques from federated learning and cryptographic proof systems (like zero-knowledge proofs) with the blockchain provenance framework. This could enable secure multi-party calibration metadata sharing across different legal entities without exposing sensitive underlying data, directly addressing privacy concerns inherent in legal workflows. Leveraging federated learning concepts could also provide a broader business application perspective, facilitating decentralized yet privacy-preserving AI model fine-tuning across jurisdictions or organizations. Furthermore, incorporating blockchain platforms tailored for secure IoT applications and big data provenance management could improve scalability and performance. This integrated approach aligns with computational intelligence and software innovation trends, potentially positioning the research at the intersection of secure AI governance, blockchain, and federated learning, thus elevating its competitiveness and relevance within the informatics and legal informatics fields."
