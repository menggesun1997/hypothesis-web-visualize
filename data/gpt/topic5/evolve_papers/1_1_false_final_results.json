    "title": "Digital Competency Aware Interactive AI Framework for Trustworthy Healthcare Decision Support",
    "Problem_Statement": "Healthcare providers’ varying digital competencies and trust in AI interventions lead to inconsistent adoption and safety risks of LLM-based clinical decision tools.",
    "Motivation": "Directly addresses the external gap concerning human-AI trust dynamics and digital competence by embedding adaptive interaction strategies personalized to clinician profiles derived from digital transformation and nursing education theories.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an AI-augmented decision support system that dynamically assesses clinician digital literacy and trust propensity through brief contextual quizzes and interaction patterns. Using this profile, the system modulates the explanation complexity, transparency depth, and intervention assertiveness of the LLM outputs. Integrate continuous trust recalibration mechanisms via embedded feedback loops and explainable moral reasoning overlays to foster calibrated reliance and oversight.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets on healthcare professionals’ digital literacy and trust in AI through surveys and simulated clinical tasks. 2) Develop profiling algorithms and integrate them into the LLM interface. 3) Train the system to adjust output explanations and transparency tokens based on profile input. 4) Conduct controlled user studies in simulated clinical decision-making settings, comparing trust calibration, decision accuracy, and cognitive load against static LLM interfaces.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A junior nurse with low digital competency receives a diagnostic suggestion. The system provides a simplified explanation and offers supplemental educational resources, increasing safety and confidence. Conversely, an experienced physician views detailed moral reasoning chains and optional protocol references.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If profiling proves insufficiently predictive, introduce adaptive learning over time from observed user corrections and trust signals, allowing the system to self-tune interaction styles without explicit profiles."
