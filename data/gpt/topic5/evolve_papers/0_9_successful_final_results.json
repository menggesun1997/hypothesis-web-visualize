        "title": "Interactive Ontology-Guided LLM Calibration with Blockchain-Backed Provenance and Digital Forensics for Trustworthy Financial Advice",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed for financial advice suffer from miscalibrated confidence scores and hallucinations, which reduce user trust and complicate error detection. Current approaches insufficiently specify how ontological constraints and immutable provenance can be dynamically integrated to recalibrate confidence in real-time. Moreover, they lack user-centric interfaces and forensic auditing mechanisms that leverage provenance data to detect suspicious advice patterns and enhance actionable trustworthiness.",
        "Motivation": "While ontology-based calibration, confidence adjustment, and blockchain provenance are individually explored, their isolated combination limits impact. By tightly integrating these components with explainable human-computer interaction (HCI) elements and advanced digital forensic analysis, this work advances beyond existing methods to create a comprehensive, user-facing system. This system not only quantitatively recalibrates LLM outputs based on ontology and provenance constraints in real-time but also empowers users through interactive trust visualizations and automated forensic alerts, thereby significantly elevating reliability, transparency, and usability in financial AI assistants.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Our method innovates via a four-layer architecture: (1) Ontology Layer—a formal financial ontology encodes domain concepts, relations, and logical constraints. (2) Calibration Layer—implements a confidence recalibration module receiving LLM-generated facts and confidence scores; it quantitatively evaluates each fact against ontology constraints using a scoring function that penalizes inconsistencies detected via logical inference engines and semantic similarity metrics. Confidence scores are adjusted by multiplying original scores with an ontology coherence factor derived from these evaluations. (3) Provenance & Blockchain Layer—provenance metadata (data sources, timestamps, transformation logs) about inputs and outputs are hashed and immutably stored in a permissioned blockchain. This layer provides APIs to retrieve provenance proofs in real-time. The recalibration module integrates these proofs by adjusting confidence based on provenance trust scores computed via source reputation and metadata consistency checks. (4) User Interaction & Forensics Layer—provides a rich interactive dashboard visualizing calibrated confidence, provenance trails, and explanation overlays generated by the calibration module. Embedded digital forensic algorithms periodically analyze provenance patterns to detect anomalies such as source inconsistencies, repeated hallucinations, or suspicious advice clusters, generating real-time alerts for users and system administrators. The entire workflow runs in a pipelined manner enabling near real-time operation. We present detailed algorithmic formulations, including: (a) Confidence Recalibration Algorithm combining ontology logical consistency scores (C_ont) with provenance trust scores (C_prov) to produce a final calibrated confidence C_final = C_orig × (α·C_ont + β·C_prov), where α, β are tunable weights; (b) Provenance Hash Linkage Algorithm that constructs Merkle trees for metadata batches, anchoring them in blockchain blocks to ensure tamper-evident proofs; (c) Forensic Anomaly Detector employing statistical pattern recognition and rule-based heuristics on provenance timelines. The modular architecture and data flow diagrams are elaborated to clarify component interactions and extensibility.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop a comprehensive financial ontology incorporating regulatory, market, and investment concepts with formal constraints. 2) Curate a provenance-enriched dataset simulating financial advice generation with rich metadata about trusted and untrusted sources. 3) Implement the confidence recalibration module integrating ontology-based logic inference and provenance trust scoring. 4) Develop the blockchain-backed provenance storage system using a Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain network detailing hash linking and query APIs. 5) Design and build the interactive user interface dashboard embedding calibrated confidence visualizations and provenance exploration features. 6) Develop digital forensic tools for automated anomaly detection and alerting. 7) Conduct extensive quantitative evaluation of calibration accuracy, hallucination reduction, and auditability compared to baseline LLM outputs and prior calibration methods. 8) Run user studies assessing trust, usability, and actionable insight provided by the interactive system with financial professionals and lay users. 9) Benchmark system latency to ensure near real-time responsiveness under realistic workloads.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: Input: 'Invest 30% in technology stocks with 90% confidence.' Ontology flags partial inconsistency since allocation summations violate portfolio constraints. Calibration module adjusts confidence down to 65%. Blockchain provenance reveals source data timestamps and source reputations. UI dashboard highlights recalibration causes with tooltip explanations and shows provenance trail. Forensic detector flags unusual repeated contradictory advice from source X, triggering alert. Example 2: Input: 'Diversify investments across sectors with 85% confidence.' Ontology confirms compliance with diversification constraints, and provenance indicates high-reputation source consistency. Final confidence remains high at 82%. UI interface shows strong trust indicators and provenance validation. Forensic tools report no anomalies.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time integration proves challenging due to computational or blockchain throughput constraints, we will implement an asynchronous batch recalibration and provenance anchoring pipeline. Confidence recalibration will leverage cached ontology-consistency scores and off-chain provenance indexes with cryptographic commitments to the blockchain, maintaining tamper-evidence while lowering latency. We will prioritize forensic detection in offline mode with user notification upon analysis completion, ensuring continued trust enhancements despite performance trade-offs."

Specifically, the calibration layer's technical workings—how it quantitatively adjusts confidence scores based on ontological constraints, and how it integrates with LLM outputs—require clarification. Also, the method for linking provenance metadata immutably to the blockchain and subsequently using that data to influence LLM outputs needs elaboration. Detailing these mechanisms with respect to model architecture, data flows, and real-time operation will enhance soundness and credibility of the approach, making it clearer how proposed components interact to reduce hallucinations and improve trustworthiness in financial advice generation. Including example algorithms or preliminary design diagrams could strengthen this section significantly, making it actionable for implementation and review purposes (Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the idea's pre-screening as NOV-COMPETITIVE due to its combination of well-studied components (LLM calibration, ontologies, blockchain provenance), a promising direction to elevate impact and novelty is to integrate concepts from 'human-computer interaction' and 'digital forensics.' For example, designing an interactive user interface that leverages the calibrated confidence scores and blockchain provenance to provide explainable, actionable feedback to end-users would enhance trust and usability of financial advice systems. Additionally, incorporating forensic analysis techniques into provenance auditing could enable automated detection and alerting of suspicious or anomalous advice patterns. Embedding this cross-disciplinary perspective can differentiate the work by showcasing practical, user-centered trustworthiness enhancements beyond algorithmic improvements, potentially opening new research and application avenues and increasing the work's relevance and scope (Globally-Linked Concepts)."
