    "title": "Adaptive Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Multi-Institutional Financial Advisory LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Gathering diverse private financial data for training LLMs risks breaching privacy and limits model generalizability due to siloed data and domain expertise disparities.",
    "Motivation": "This idea tackles internal gaps around data privacy and generalizability by proposing a federated learning framework tailored for financial LLMs that adaptively balances local privacy, global model performance, and domain adaptation through personalized training and differential privacy safeguards.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a federated LLM training system where multiple financial institutions collaboratively update a global model without sharing raw data. Introduce adaptive personalization layers that fine-tune outputs to local domain expertise, enhanced with differential privacy to certify data protection. Model updates include hallucination evaluation feedback loops.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Partner with multiple institutions providing sanctioned datasets; 2) Implement federated training protocols with privacy guarantees; 3) Measure model performance on institution-specific vs. global tasks; 4) Assess hallucination rates pre- and post-personalization; 5) Benchmark against centralized training baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Scenario: Institution A trains locally on unique bond market data; global model reflects combined knowledge without exposing private details. Output tailored to institution A's data patterns with fewer hallucinations relative to generic model.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated approach impairs model convergence, investigate hybrid centralized-federated methods or optimize privacy-utility trade-offs further."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed mechanism describes adaptive personalization layers and differential privacy safeguards with hallucination feedback loops, but lacks detailed explanation of how these components coexist and interact in the federated setting. Key points such as how personalization layers are trained without compromising privacy, how differential privacy noise affects model utility locally and globally, and the operationalization of hallucination evaluation feedback need explicit clarification. Strengthening this clarity will enhance the soundness and reproducibility of the method and bolster confidence in its feasibility under realistic institutional constraints, especially given the complexity of financial data and compliance requirements. Please provide a more formalized system architecture and algorithmic workflow illustrating these interactions and privacy-preserving guarantees in detail within the Proposed_Method section. This will also help anticipate potential pitfalls in optimization and convergence behavior specific to the adaptive and privacy-preserving nature of the framework, which are currently left vague and assumed to work well together without rigorous justification or risk management strategies (e.g., in cases of heterogeneity or adversarial updates)."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating and overlapping prior work, integrating synthetic data generation techniques or leveraging knowledge graphs could notably enhance the framework's novelty and impact. For example, employing generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create privacy-preserving synthetic financial data could supplement the federated updates and mitigate data heterogeneity. Alternatively, incorporating knowledge graphs encoding institutional domain expertise may improve personalization layers by explicitly modeling relationships between financial entities across institutions without direct data sharing. These additions would deepen the methodological innovation and potentially improve model generalization and robustness. I suggest exploring these linked concepts to extend the proposed federated learning architecture, thereby positioning it more distinctly against existing approaches and broadening practical applicability beyond initial test cases."
