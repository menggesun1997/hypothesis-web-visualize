    "title": "Hybrid Multi-Agent Consensus Framework for Hallucination Detection in Financial LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs in financial advisory often hallucinate or produce inaccurate information, undermining trust and risking regulatory compliance. Existing methods insufficiently detect and mitigate hallucinations within domain-specific contexts where expert knowledge is critical.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical internal gap of reliable hallucination detection under financial constraints by leveraging a novel hybrid multi-agent consensus framework combining domain expert systems, multiple LLM instances, and rule-based validators to cross-verify outputs, ensuring higher factual consistency and trustworthiness.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a system where multiple specialized LLMs produce advisory outputs independently. These outputs are then verified by a symbolic finance knowledge engine encoded with domain rules and regulations. A consensus algorithm aggregates the outputs, flags deviations, and uses explainable AI to highlight potential hallucinations. Mistakes detected trigger an adaptive retraining loop with domain-specific corrective feedback.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble financial datasets and regulatory documents; 2) Fine-tune multiple LLM variants on financial advice; 3) Build symbolic finance knowledge base for verification; 4) Implement consensus and hallucination scoring mechanism; 5) Compare with baselines (single LLM, heuristic checks) using accuracy, hallucination rates, and explainability metrics; 6) Perform user studies assessing trust/satisfaction.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Suggest investment in company XYZ, which has shown 25% growth last quarter.' Expected: Consensus output includes verification that the 25% growth is based on authentic quarterly reports; flagged hallucinations if data unsupported by financial filings.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If consensus fails due to conflicting outputs, fallback to a human-in-the-loop review step or incorporate probabilistic uncertainty estimates to defer unclear recommendations."

        "title": "Context-Adaptive Hybrid Multi-Agent Consensus Framework for Hallucination Detection in Financial LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) used in financial advisory frequently produce hallucinated or inaccurate outputs, which compromise trustworthiness, user safety, and compliance with strict financial regulations. Current approaches lack detailed, domain-aware verification mechanisms and adaptability to evolving user intents or regulatory shifts, limiting their effectiveness in high-stakes financial contexts.",
        "Motivation": "While multiple-agent frameworks and hybrid verification methods have been proposed for hallucination detection, most lack dynamic adaptability and precise, mechanistic explanation of disagreements among agents. Our work aims to fill this critical gap by designing a context-adaptive consensus system that tightly integrates domain-specific expert knowledge with state-of-the-art explainable AI and intent-driven orchestration. This approach introduces innovative mechanisms to dynamically reweight agent outputs and incorporate process mining insights, resulting in a novel, self-aware hallucination detection system advancing beyond static ensembles. This represents a substantial novelty and impact leap over current methods by enhancing robustness, compliance alignment, and trust in financial LLM deployment.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid multi-agent consensus framework with four principal components: (1) Multiple specialized LLM agents independently generate financial advice outputs fine-tuned for subdomains such as equities, regulation, and macroeconomics. (2) A symbolic finance knowledge engine encodes domain rules, regulatory constraints, and compliance checks, providing symbolic validation of LLM outputs. (3) An intent-driven orchestration layer inspired by intent-based networking dynamically manages agent weighting and knowledge engine selection by continuously mining transaction logs and user interaction patterns (process mining). This layer adapts consensus criteria and agent prioritization to reflect evolving regulatory landscapes and user intents in real time. (4) A consensus algorithm aggregates agent outputs with a configurable agreement threshold and conflict resolution steps:  \n- **Consensus aggregation:** Compute a weighted vote where weights derive from historical agent reliability, intent-driven prioritization, and knowledge engine feedback.\n- **Conflict resolution:** Outputs failing consensus trigger explainable AI modules that produce fine-grained attribution maps pinpointing hallucinated phrases or entities, leveraging attention and counterfactual analysis.\n- **Adaptive retraining loop:** Detected hallucinations feed into a synthetic data generation pipeline augmenting rare and edge financial cases, strengthening retraining datasets to improve future accuracy.\n\nPseudocode outlines:  \n\n```\nfor each input_query:\n    agent_outputs = [LLM_agent_i(input_query) for i in agents]\n    validation_scores = [knowledge_engine.validate(o) for o in agent_outputs]\n    intent_weights = orchestration_layer.compute_weights(current_intent, validation_scores)\n    consensus_score, consensus_output = aggregate(agent_outputs, intent_weights, threshold=theta)\n    if consensus_score < theta:\n        hallucination_map = explainable_AI.analyze_conflicts(agent_outputs)\n        trigger_adaptive_retraining(hallucination_map, input_query)\n    return consensus_output, hallucination_map\n```\n\nThis design operationalizes consensus with detailed conflict adjudication under realistic regulatory semantics, ensuring transparency and regulatory compliance crucial in financial settings.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect a comprehensive financial corpus including diverse market data, regulatory frameworks, user interaction logs, and rare case reports;  \n2) Fine-tune multiple specialized LLM variants on segmented financial domains;  \n3) Develop a symbolic knowledge base formalizing financial regulations and domain heuristics with verification capabilities;  \n4) Implement the intent-driven orchestration layer leveraging process mining on interaction logs to dynamically adjust agent weights and consensus parameters;  \n5) Develop and integrate the consensus algorithm with explicit agreement thresholds, conflict resolution, and explainable AI modules;  \n6) Design a synthetic dataset generation pipeline for augmenting rare financial scenarios in the adaptive retraining loop;  \n7) Conduct benchmark comparisons against baseline models (single LLM, heuristic verification) measuring accuracy, hallucination incidence, explainability, and compliance adherence;  \n8) Perform user and expert studies analyzing trust, satisfaction, and system transparency over time, especially after regulatory or user intent shifts.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Recommend investment in Company XYZ, which showed 25% growth last quarter.'  \nExpected behavior:  \n- Multiple specialized agents assess the claim based on quarterly financial data and sector performance.  \n- Symbolic engine verifies the 25% growth claim against recent authentic filings.  \n- Intent-driven orchestration prioritizes regulatory compliance agents when flagged transactions or user queries indicate compliance-critical intents.  \n- If agents disagree, conflict resolution highlights hallucinated growth figures or unsupported statements with attention maps.  \n- Adaptive retraining ingests the incident if erroneous data is detected, augmenting synthetic cases illustrating similar rare growth pattern claims with backing data.  \n- Outputs robustly align with verified data, or clearly flag hallucination risks and defer advice to human review if uncertain.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If consensus aggregation fails due to irresolvable conflicts or low confidence scores, the system defers to a human-in-the-loop for review and final decision, with interfaces highlighting conflict diagnostics via explainable AI outputs. Alternatively, probabilistic uncertainty estimates trigger conservative fallback advisory modes restricting recommendations to verified, high-confidence information only. Synthetic data generation in retraining is iteratively adjusted to mitigate persistent hallucination patterns, ensuring continuous improvement under real-world constraints."

Elaborating these mechanisms will strengthen soundness by showing feasibility of operationalizing the multi-agent verification and its adaptive retraining feedback loops in realistic, domain-specific settings within financial regulatory constraints. Providing concrete design choices or pseudocode for key components will clarify implementation viability under complex financial semantics and compliance requirements, preventing ambiguity in how outputs are aggregated and errors are detected or adjudicated between agents and symbolic knowledge checks, crucial for trustworthiness claims in high-stakes environments like finance. Targeting Proposed_Method for refinement will markedly enhance reproducibility and anticipatory robustness of the approach in practice, bolstering reviewer confidence in the core technical feasibility and soundness of the submission."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the idea’s novelty is rated NOV-COMPETITIVE, to elevate impact and novelty it is recommended to integrate concepts from 'intent-based networking' or 'process mining' to dynamically adapt the consensus framework based on evolving user intent or regulatory shifts in the financial domain. For example, embedding an intent-driven orchestration layer could allow the multi-agent system to prioritize agents or knowledge validators corresponding to real-time regulatory updates or transaction patterns extracted via process mining. This would enhance system agility in identifying hallucinations aligned to current compliance contexts, improving both accuracy and trust dynamically. Additionally, leveraging recent advances in 'generation of synthetic datasets' can strengthen the adaptive retraining loop by augmenting rare or outlier financial cases, improving detection coverage beyond historical data. Such integration would make the framework more robust and forward-looking, positioning it beyond static ensemble verification towards a self-aware, context-adaptive hallucination detection architecture, potentially setting new state-of-the-art standards in safe LLM deployment in finance."
