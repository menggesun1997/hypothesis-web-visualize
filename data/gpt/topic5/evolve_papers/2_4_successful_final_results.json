        "title": "Cross-Modal Fusion and Federated Learning for Context-Aware Scalable Adversarial Defense in Multi-Modal Customer Interactions",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current adversarial training approaches are challenged by the dynamic, multi-modal nature of real-world customer interactions. They lack comprehensive integration of heterogeneous data sources—including text, audio, and visual cues—and fail to leverage temporal interaction context and decentralized data distribution. These limitations reduce robustness and scalability when detecting subtle adversarial patterns across diverse interaction channels, hindering deployment in privacy-sensitive, distributed environments such as Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and cyber-physical systems.",
        "Motivation": "Although multi-modal adversarial detection has gained traction, existing solutions often treat modalities independently or fuse modalities superficially without robust architecture or context modeling, limiting effectiveness against sophisticated attacks. By designing a principled fusion mechanism combining textual, vocal emotion, and visual cues with interaction provenance, and incorporating temporally-aware models, we can capture nuanced adversarial signals beyond text alone. Furthermore, integrating federated learning over distributed customer endpoints addresses data sparsity and privacy challenges, enabling scalable and robust deployment. This dual innovation—deep multimodal fusion and federated context-aware training—marks a novel advance beyond conventional multi-modal adversarial defenses, offering enhanced robustness, scalability, and real-world applicability in open-world, cyber-physical contexts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based adversarial defense framework with the following key innovations: (1) Multi-Modal Fusion Architecture: Implement a hybrid fusion strategy where low-level convolutional neural networks (CNNs) extract emotion embeddings from audio and visual CNNs extract facial and gesture cues, while textual inputs are encoded via transformer-based LLMs. These embeddings feed into a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) units that model temporal dynamics and interaction provenance metadata, capturing context evolution. The joint embedding space is learned with contrastive loss designed to maximize sensitivity to adversarial discrepancies across modes. (2) Federated Learning Paradigm: Deploy the model in a federated learning setup wherein edge devices hosting customer interactions locally train modality-specific encoders and share encrypted embeddings/gradients with a central server for global model aggregation, ensuring data privacy and overcoming heterogeneity/sparsity of multi-modal data. (3) Vision-Language Integration: Incorporate vision-language models pre-trained on joint text-video datasets as a backbone to enrich visual and textual semantic alignment enhancing detection of subtle, context-dependent adversarial manipulations. (4) Adaptive Recovery Module: Conditioned on multimodal embedding uncertainty and adversarial detection confidence, dynamic recovery strategies activate varying levels of interaction fallback, clarification requests, or escalation, improving downstream user engagement retention. This design markedly advances state-of-the-art by unifying sophisticated multi-modal fusion, temporal and provenance context modeling, federated privacy-preserving training, and vision-language semantic grounding, producing a scalable, robust, and generalizable adversarial defense system applicable to IoV and cyber-physical environments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Collection: Curate or extend datasets of multi-modal customer interactions containing text, audio, and visual cues with annotated adversarial and benign samples, ensuring metadata for interaction provenance and temporal context. 2) Model Development: Build modality-specific encoders (CNN-based for audio and visual, transformer for text), and implement the hybrid fusion architecture integrating LSTM temporal models and contrastive loss for joint embedding. 3) Federated Learning Framework: Set up a federated learning simulation environment with multiple client nodes simulating edge devices, develop privacy-preserving protocols for gradient aggregation, and integrate with model training. 4) Baselines: Compare against text-only adversarially trained models, naïve multi-modal fusion without temporal/provenance modeling, and centralized training counterparts. 5) Evaluation Metrics: Measure adversarial detection accuracy, false positive/negative rates, recovery strategy efficacy, user engagement retention, scalability (training/inference time, communication overhead), and privacy leakage risks. 6) Ablation Studies: Evaluate contribution of each modality, fusion strategy variant, temporal modeling, vision-language modules, and federated learning effects. 7) Real-World Deployment: Pilot deployment in simulated IoV or cyber-physical scenario to assess system robustness under realistic non-iid data distributions and constrained resources.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "- Input: A customer interaction exhibiting sarcastic text with misleading phrasing combined with negative vocal tone and incongruent facial expressions. Expected output: The system identifies inconsistencies via hybrid fusion and temporal context, effectively detecting adversarial intent with high confidence, triggering a clarification dialogue and engaging fallback recovery without disrupting user experience. - Input: A distributed edge node with sparse audio data but rich video and text metadata performs local training. The federated aggregation effectively integrates this heterogeneous data, improving global model robustness. - Input: An adversarial attack subtly manipulates visual gestures unaligned with accompanying text and voice, undetected by single-modality models but caught by the vision-language enhanced fusion model through semantic inconsistency detection, leading to timely defense activation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated learning proves impractical due to resource constraints or communication issues, fall back to a centralized multi-modal training pipeline emphasizing data augmentation and synthetic multi-modal sample generation for coverage. Should multi-modal data scarcity persist, employ advanced simulation and domain adaptation techniques to generate realistic audio-visual cues aligned with textual interactions. If vision-language model integration increases complexity or latency beyond acceptable bounds, prioritize modular late-fusion variants with precomputed embeddings to preserve performance gains while managing computational overhead."

          "feedback_content": "While the idea of integrating multi-modal inputs (text, voice emotion, provenance metadata) into a large language model (LLM) framework for adversarial detection is promising, the proposal lacks specific detail on how these heterogeneous data types will be fused and how their joint embeddings will reliably capture subtle adversarial cues. Clear architectural design choices, fusion strategies (early, late, or hybrid), and modeling of temporal or interaction context are needed to assess soundness. Strengthening this will improve confidence that the proposed mechanism can effectively detect nuanced adversarial signals beyond text alone, rather than being a superficial multimodal extension without theoretical justification or prior proof-of-concept rationale. I recommend elaborating on the model fusion design and providing pilot studies or references for feasibility of such contextual embeddings for adversarial tasks to enhance clarity and plausibility of the proposed method’s mechanism and distinct contribution to adversarial robustness research. This will help differentiate this work in the competitive landscape noted in novelty screening."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE status and the existing strong links between multi-modal approaches and adversarial detection, there is an opportunity to enhance impact and novelty by integrating concepts from 'vision-language models' or 'federated learning' from the globally linked concepts. For example, extending the framework to leverage vision-language fusion models could enrich contextual understanding beyond text and audio—adding visual customer cues improves robustness, broadening applicability to more naturalistic interactions. Furthermore, exploring federated learning approaches might address data sparsity and privacy concerns in multi-modal customer interactions while improving scalability and deployment feasibility across distributed systems. Including such integrations as a complementary research direction or module could significantly elevate the work’s originality and broaden its interest across cyber-physical or IoV settings, thus addressing known challenges in current adversarial defense and making the approach more impactful and competitive."
