        "title": "Cognitive-Driven Adaptive Intent Recovery",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM-based autonomous customer service agents lack scalable, user-personalized recovery frameworks that can dynamically adapt to evolving adversarial tactics based on real-time user intent feedback. This leads to brittle responses and poor resilience in naturalistic interactions.",
        "Motivation": "This addresses the internal gap of insufficient recovery personalization and lack of user-centric dynamic feedback loops by integrating cognitive science theories on human error correction into adaptive adversarial recovery frameworks, a high-potential innovation opportunity.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid system combining a cognitive error model that predicts user frustration and misunderstandings with an adaptive adversarial recovery module. The system continuously captures real-time user interactions and feedback signals (e.g., sentiment shifts, repetition) to tailor recovery strategies by updating intent hypotheses dynamically. The architecture leverages a dual-loop feedback design: a fast loop for immediate correction and a slow loop for policy adjustments, inspired by human cognitive error correction.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data collection of adversarial user interactions with customer agents, annotated for intent shifts and frustration.\n2) Implementation of a cognitive error predictor module trained on such data.\n3) Integration with an LLM-based autonomous agent enhanced by an adaptive recovery layer.\n4) Baselines include standard adversarial training and static recovery.\n5) Evaluation metrics: robustness to adversarial attacks, recovery success rate, user satisfaction via simulated feedback.\n6) Ablations to isolate cognitive module effects.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User repeatedly asks \"Why is my bill so high?\" with increasing frustration.\nExpected output: The agent recognizes rising frustration, adapts intent hypotheses, and invokes customized recovery, e.g., offers detailed billing explanation and escalates if dissatisfaction persists.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If cognitive error prediction is insufficient, fallback to heuristic sentiment-based triggers for recovery adaptation. Also, experiment with reinforcement learning to refine dynamic intent adaptation policies."

        "title": "Neuro-Symbolic Explainable Recovery Engine",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current recovery protocols in autonomous customer service agents are largely empirical and lack theoretical grounding, resulting in opaque and unreliable error correction processes.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the gap of lacking theoretical recovery grounding and insufficient explainability by leveraging neuro-symbolic reasoning to create interpretable and principled recovery strategies, a key external research opportunity.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a neuro-symbolic framework integrating a symbolic logic-based reasoning module with a neural LLM for autonomous agents. The symbolic layer encodes recovery rules and dialogue constraints, enabling explainable reasoning paths during recovery. The neural module handles language generation and user input understanding. During adversarial failures, the system invokes symbolic reasoning to generate recovery actions supported by logical proofs, enhancing transparency and trustworthiness.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Formalize recovery rules and error categories into symbolic representations.\n2) Build a differentiable neuro-symbolic reasoning architecture coupling the symbolic engine with an LLM.\n3) Train and fine-tune on customer service dialogues with annotated recovery scenarios.\n4) Baseline comparison with standard neural-only agents.\n5) Metrics: recovery accuracy, explainability score (e.g., user trust surveys), and robustness to adversarial inputs.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An adversarial query designed to confuse the agent.\nExpected output: The system identifies the error type symbolically, generates corrective dialogue with a human-readable explanation of the logic applied.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If neuro-symbolic integration underperforms, fallback to post-hoc explanation methods such as attention visualization or rule extraction for approximate explainability."

        "title": "RLHF-Enhanced Adversarial Resilience Policy Learning",
        "Problem_Statement": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has not been effectively tailored to adversarial failures in autonomous customer service agents, leaving a methodological gap in dynamic robustness and recovery policy optimization.",
        "Motivation": "This proposal exploits the untapped synergy of RLHF with adversarial failure scenarios to dynamically improve robustness and recovery policies, directly responding to the identified internal and external gaps and innovation opportunities.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a specialized RLHF framework where human evaluators provide ordinal and qualitative feedback on recovery outcomes under adversarial conditions. The policy learns to select robust recovery actions by optimizing long-term interaction success, incorporating human preferences for resilience and user satisfaction. The system uses a hierarchical policy architecture: low-level dialogue actions and high-level recovery strategy selection, trained via human-in-the-loop reinforcement signals.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets of adversarial customer interactions with human feedback labels.\n2) Implement a hierarchical RL agent training with PPO or similar algorithms.\n3) Define reward functions aligned with robustness, recovery success, and user satisfaction.\n4) Baseline: supervised fine-tuning without RLHF.\n5) Evaluate on adversarial benchmarks, measure improvement in recovery rates and user satisfaction.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User deliberately providing ambiguous inputs to confuse the agent.\nExpected output: The agent selects a cautious recovery strategy with human-preferred resolution steps, resulting in successful clarification and continued engagement.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If human feedback is noisy or sparse, simulate feedback with proxy reward models or augment with semi-supervised learning approaches."

        "title": "Personalized Recovery Feedback Loop via Cognitive User Profiling",
        "Problem_Statement": "Autonomous customer service agents lack dynamic, personalized recovery mechanisms that adapt to diverse user intents and cognitive error profiles during adversarial failures.",
        "Motivation": "To close the internal gap on personalization and dynamic feedback integration, this project proposes leveraging cognitive profiling of users to tailor recovery strategies uniquely, inspired by cognitive science and cross-disciplinary insights.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop user intent models enriched with cognitive profiles derived from interaction patterns and response behaviors (e.g., error tendencies, patience levels). The system maintains a personalized recovery policy per user archetype, learned and updated continuously using unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The agent selects recovery actions optimized for individual cognitive features, improving resilience and user experience.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate datasets with user metadata and interaction logs.\n2) Cluster users into cognitive profiles using behavioral features.\n3) Train personalized recovery policies per cluster.\n4) Evaluate on adversarial interaction datasets with stratified user groups.\n5) Metrics: recovery efficacy, user satisfaction, and adaptability across profiles.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user prone to impatience issues sends conflicting commands.\nExpected output: The agent uses a recovery approach focusing on concise, clear clarification steps minimizing interaction length.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If cognitive profiling accuracy is low, implement adaptive meta-learning techniques to generalize recovery policies without explicit user profiles."

        "title": "Cross-Modal Contextual Analysis for Scalable Adversarial Defense",
        "Problem_Statement": "Adversarial training approaches struggle to scale to the dynamic and naturalistic customer interactions due to lack of integration of multi-modal and global context information.",
        "Motivation": "Leveraging global context cues and multi-modal signals (e.g., audio tone, visual cues) offers a novel direction to enhance scalability and robustness, addressing internal scalability gaps and external cross-disciplinary potential.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-modal LLM framework integrating textual inputs with voice emotion features and interaction provenance metadata to enhance adversarial detection and recovery. The system learns contextual embeddings that detect subtle adversarial patterns beyond text. Recovery strategies dynamically adjust based on enriched context understanding, improving defense scalability across diverse channels.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multi-modal customer interaction datasets including text and audio.\n2) Train multi-modal encoders fused with LLM dialogue systems.\n3) Implement adversarial training augmented with contextual anomaly detection.\n4) Baselines include text-only adversarially trained models.\n5) Metrics: adversarial detection accuracy, recovery success, user engagement retention.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user uses sarcastic tone combined with misleading text.\nExpected output: The system detects adversarial intent by analyzing tone and text inconsistency and triggers robust recovery strategies.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-modal data is sparse, simulate audio features or focus on metadata-driven context augmentation."
