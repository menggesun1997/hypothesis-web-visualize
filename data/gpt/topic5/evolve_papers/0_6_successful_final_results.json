        "title": "Investor Risk Perception Modeling using Explainable LLMs with Enhanced Green Innovation Indicators and Psychological Profiles",
        "Problem_Statement": "While financial advisory models have increasingly incorporated ESG factors, current large language models (LLMs) used for financial advice inadequately capture the nuanced, subjective sustainability preferences of individual investors, particularly their psychological risk aversion profiles linked to green innovation. Existing financial LLMs often unify ESG signals without deeply integrating green innovation indicators in a personalized, explainable manner that connects distinct investor psychologies—such as varying sustainability priorities and risk attitudes—to tailored risk assessments. This gap limits the trustworthiness and relevance of advice for investors whose decisions crucially depend on green innovation dynamics and nuanced personal preferences.",
        "Motivation": "This research aims to address the identified limitations through a novel fusion of behavioral financial economics and AI governance by embedding investor psychological profiles—explicitly encoding heterogeneous risk aversion and green priority dimensions—within an LLM framework augmented by comprehensive, temporally and sectorally granular green innovation indicators. While prior models incorporate ESG broadly, they generally lack rigor in explainable personalization grounded in explicit psychological modeling and transparent causal links to green innovation. By bridging these external gaps with an innovative multi-input architecture enhanced by generative adversarial network (GAN)-based data augmentation to overcome limited investor datasets, the research enhances personalization and trustworthiness of AI financial advice. Our approach distinctly advances beyond competitive baselines by offering interpretable causal explainability layers that trace investment recommendations directly to investor-specific sustainability considerations and evolving green innovation signals, thus catering to evolving, psychologically grounded investor needs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-input LLM architecture where investor profile embeddings explicitly capture validated financial behavioral constructs of risk aversion and sustainability preference, drawing on established psychological and behavioral finance literature (e.g., prospect theory, sustainability mindset frameworks). Investor profile embeddings are learned from comprehensive survey data and augmented using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate realistic synthetic profiles to mitigate sparse data challenges. Concurrently, high-resolution green innovation indicators—sourced from international databases with sectoral and temporal granularity (e.g., patent filings, green R&D expenditure from financial economics datasets)—are integrated as structured contextual features. The model is trained end-to-end to align investor profiles, green innovation data, and financial returns, using multi-objective loss functions balancing accuracy, trustworthiness, and explainability metrics. Explainability is achieved through added causal attention mechanisms that transparently highlight how green innovation signals influence risk perception conditioned on investor psychological embeddings. Additionally, an agent system simulates dynamic investor decision processes to further validate model robustness and practical financial task adaptability, bridging theoretical modeling and real-world application.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Collection: Assemble a representative dataset combining detailed investor risk profiles—collected via validated survey instruments including sustainability preference scales—and granular green innovation metrics with temporal and sectoral resolution from financial databases and international sources; 2) Data Augmentation: Employ GAN-based techniques to synthetically expand investor profile data, preserving realistic heterogeneity; 3) Model Development: Build the multi-input LLM with embedded behavioral finance-inspired investor profiles and green innovation features, incorporating causal attention explainability modules; 4) Training and Optimization: Use multi-objective losses targeting predictive accuracy, personalized trustworthiness (measured via model confidence and calibration), and explainability quality (quantified by attention interpretability metrics); 5) User Studies: Recruit a diverse participant pool stratified by sustainability engagement and investment experience, conduct within-subject evaluations comparing model-generated advice against leading generic ESG advisory baselines on relevance, accuracy, trust, and explanation clarity using quantitative scales and qualitative interviews; 6) Robustness and Fallback Integration: Implement unsupervised clustering and demographic proxy embeddings as fallback strategies for sparse input cases, formally evaluating performance degradation and utility trade-offs; 7) Comparative Benchmarking: Benchmark against state-of-the-art ESG-incorporating financial advisors using established performance metrics with hypothesized moderate but statistically significant gains in trust and explanatory power; 8) Agent System Simulation: Use the developed agent system to simulate longitudinal investor interactions with the model in dynamic financial task scenarios to test adaptability and integration feasibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An investor profile reflecting high sustainability priority and moderate risk aversion is presented alongside up-to-date green innovation metrics highlighting emerging renewable energy technologies in specific sectors. Output: The model recommends investments predominantly in companies leading renewable tech innovation with transparent explanations tracing lower projected long-term risk to advances in green R&D and alignment with the investor's sustainability-driven risk tolerance. Comparative output from a baseline model neglecting personalized psychological embeddings is less tailored and offers generic ESG references without causal explanation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "To address potential scarcity of personalized investor profile data, we will implement fallback mechanisms: first, apply unsupervised clustering techniques on available behavioral and demographic attributes to infer investor types, producing semi-personalized embeddings reflecting grouped risk and sustainability preferences; second, use demographic proxy embeddings derived from publicly available socioeconomic data as coarse-personalization surrogates. We will integrate these fallbacks within the experimental pipeline to evaluate associated performance and explainability degradations quantitatively and ensure practical applicability across varied data availability scenarios without undermining core methodological validity."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that existing financial LLMs inadequately incorporate investors' subjective sustainability preferences and green innovation signals requires stronger empirical foundation. The proposal should more explicitly justify why modeling green innovation indicators alongside psychological investor profiles substantially improves trustworthiness and personalization over existing financial advisory systems, which increasingly integrate ESG factors. Clarifying this assumption with citations or preliminary analyses would strengthen soundness and motivate the design choices better, preventing underestimation of existing models' capabilities or overselling novelty in a competitive domain familiar with ESG incorporation methods. Suggest including a brief literature grounding that critically assesses current gaps in explanation and personalization around green innovation in financial LLMs to validate this foundational premise adequately within the Problem_Statement and Motivation sections, reinforcing the rationale for the proposed integration approach while reducing risks of redundant effort given the competitive environment of this research area in financial economics and AI governance contexts. This will align stakeholders’ expectations about the realistic incremental value of the method and ensure sound base assumptions for downstream modeling steps and experiments planning without losing novelty or feasibility focus. Target refinement here aids clarity and impact potential measured by downstream user trust and acceptance in advisory outputs tailored to sustainability preferences, the core contribution theme of the work. This is critical given the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating and the well-developed landscape of financial AI models incorporating sustainability factors today.  Recommend to revise Problem_Statement and Motivation accordingly with focused justification including specific green innovation indicators' insufficiency in existing LLM advisory explanations and personalization capabilities, explicitly tying to investor psychology variables as a unique external gap to be bridged for trustworthy advice generation tailored to green investment preferences.  \n\nFurthermore, explicit reasoning about how the investor profile embeddings will effectively encode risk aversion and sustainability priorities should be articulated, ensuring that these embeddings realistically capture meaningful individual differences relevant to risk modeling and investment decision explanations, given the complexity and subjectivity of these concepts. These assumptions drive the mechanism downstream and thus must be made transparent and justified in the Proposal_Method section as well, possibly supported by prior psychological or behavioral financial studies on investor heterogeneity that can then be computationally represented in AI models for personalized outputs. Without these details, feasibility and soundness suffer, and reviewers may question methodological grounding and validity of the model design and its explainability layers' interpretability claims. A clearer chain of reasoning from assumptions through to the explainability approach ensures intellectual rigor and better positions the work for acceptance and impactful contribution in the field."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan requires elaboration and strengthening to demonstrate practical feasibility and scientific rigor in evaluating the proposed complex model combining heterogeneous data types (investor profiles and green innovation indicators) through LLM extensions with explainability layers. First, data collection plans need details on sourcing comprehensive, high-quality investor risk profile data encompassing sustainability preferences, and green innovation indexes with temporal and sectoral granularity. Without clear access to representative datasets, the training and evaluation steps risk being infeasible or unrepresentative. Second, the methodological approach for multi-input model training combining embeddings and external data should clarify architectural choices, optimization objectives, and how explainability modules integrate technically with the LLM to ensure interpretable causal links from green factors to risk outputs rather than heuristic associations. Third, the planned user studies evaluating advice relevance, accuracy, trustworthiness, and explainability effectiveness are ambitious but underspecified: defining participant recruitment criteria, study designs (e.g., within-subject comparisons), metrics, and statistical analyses is crucial. Fourth, fallback plans based on unsupervised clustering or demographic proxies imply a drastic methodological shift; integrating this fallback robustly into the overall experimental logic and evaluation metrics is needed to meaningfully assess performance degradation and utility. Finally, the comparison with generic advisory models should clarify baseline selections, benchmarking protocols, and reveal expected effect sizes or performance gains hypothesized. Incorporating these elaborations ensures the experiment plan is scientifically sound, practically executable, and aligned with claimed evaluation dimensions critical for demonstrating impact in a competitive research area. It will also help reviewers and stakeholders gauge expected timelines, resource needs, and result interpretability reliability, thus increasing confidence in the feasibility and ultimate contribution of this research project."
