    "Problem_Statement": "Gathering diverse private financial data for training LLMs risks breaching privacy and limits model generalizability due to siloed data and domain expertise disparities.",
    "Motivation": "This idea tackles internal gaps around data privacy and generalizability by proposing a federated learning framework tailored for financial LLMs that adaptively balances local privacy, global model performance, and domain adaptation through personalized training and differential privacy safeguards.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a federated LLM training system where multiple financial institutions collaboratively update a global model without sharing raw data. Introduce adaptive personalization layers that fine-tune outputs to local domain expertise, enhanced with differential privacy to certify data protection. Model updates include hallucination evaluation feedback loops.",

        "title": "Adaptive Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Enhanced with Synthetic Data and Knowledge Graphs for Multi-Institutional Financial Advisory LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Gathering diverse private financial data from multiple financial institutions to train large language models (LLMs) poses stringent privacy challenges, especially under regulatory compliance constraints. Furthermore, siloed data and heterogeneity across institutions limit model generalizability and personalization. Existing federated learning approaches lack detailed mechanisms to cohesively integrate adaptive personalization, privacy guarantees, and hallucination mitigation while addressing domain disparities and convergence challenges arising in complex financial settings.",
        "Motivation": "While federated learning for financial LLMs addresses privacy concerns, current methods fall short in effectively balancing local customization, strong privacy guarantees, and robustness to data heterogeneity and hallucinations. To overcome the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty gap and amplify impact, this work innovatively integrates privacy-preserving synthetic data generation and knowledge graph-enhanced personalization within a rigorously formalized federated framework. This combination enables improved model generalization, domain-aware personalization, and privacy compliance, demonstrated by a detailed algorithmic architecture designed for real-world multi-institution financial collaborations.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a federated learning system that jointly trains a global financial advisory LLM across institutions without sharing raw data, integrating three core components:\n\n1. **Adaptive Personalization Layers with Knowledge Graph Integration:** Each institution constructs a local financial knowledge graph encoding entities (e.g., instruments, clients, regulations) and their relationships. Personalization layers are fine-tuned per institution by embedding these knowledge graph representations into the LLM's intermediate layers using graph neural networks. This approach explicitly incorporates domain expertise, enabling tailored model adaptations without raw data exposure.\n\n2. **Differential Privacy with Synthetic Data Augmentation:** To further enhance privacy and reduce heterogeneity, each institution employs generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create high-fidelity, differentially private synthetic financial text data. This synthetic data supplements local training, smoothing domain gaps and improving convergence. Differential privacy noise is carefully calibrated across local updates to balance privacy budgets and model utility both locally and globally.\n\n3. **Hallucination Evaluation Feedback Loop:** We operationalize hallucination detection via automated factuality checks comparing model outputs against institution-specific knowledge graphs and synthetic data references. Feedback signals regarding hallucination prevalence are locally aggregated and included as auxiliary loss terms during federated optimization rounds. This mechanism dynamically reduces hallucinations while respecting privacy constraints.\n\n**System Architecture & Algorithmic Workflow:**\n- Initialization of global LLM with shared base weights.\n- Each round, institutions generate synthetic datasets under local differential privacy guarantees.\n- Local training updates combine real and synthetic data, updating base weights and personalization layers informed by knowledge graph embeddings.\n- Local updates are sanitized through differential privacy mechanisms before secure aggregation to update the global model.\n- Hallucination feedback is computed locally and integrated as weighted penalties in optimization.\n- Rigorous convergence monitoring with fallback heuristics for adversarial or highly heterogeneous updates.\n\nThis multi-faceted approach ensures strong privacy preserving, reduces domain discrepancies via synthetic data and knowledge graph-driven personalization, and explicitly manages hallucinations, all within a provably convergent federated framework tailored for sensitive, complex financial environments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Establish collaborations with multiple financial institutions, each providing sanctioned real datasets and enabling construction of local financial knowledge graphs.\n2) Develop and validate GAN-based differential privacy synthetic data generators tailored to financial text.\n3) Implement federated training protocol embedding knowledge graph-based personalization layers and hallucination feedback loss, with differential privacy noise calibration and synthetic data augmentation.\n4) Quantitatively evaluate model performance on institution-specific downstream advisory tasks comparing: (a) baseline centralized training; (b) federated learning without personalization; (c) federated learning with personalization but no synthetic data; (d) complete proposed method.\n5) Measure hallucination rates through automated fact-checking metrics and domain expert reviews pre- and post-personalization.\n6) Conduct ablation studies on privacy budgets, synthetic data usage ratio, and hallucination feedback weighting.\n7) Analyze convergence behavior and robustness under data heterogeneity and simulated adversarial updates.\n8) Collect qualitative feedback from participating institutions on model utility and compliance feasibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "- Institution A utilizes unique bond market datasets and a proprietary bond relationship knowledge graph; synthetic data augment local scarce training samples.\n- Institution B focuses on equity derivatives with a separate domain knowledge graph embedding complex instrument relationships.\n- Global model aggregation leverages DP-protected updates combined with synthetic data-infused local training, enabling tailored personalized outputs that reflect each institution's domain while improving overall model robustness.\n- Hallucination feedback loop detects anomalous outputs inconsistent with local knowledge graphs (e.g., false bonds or incorrect regulations) and systematically reduces these errors versus vanilla federated baselines.\n- Resulting advisory output for Institution A shows markedly fewer hallucinations and better alignment to bond market nuances compared to generic models, with strong privacy assurances and no raw data leakage.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If federated convergence adversely suffers under the combined complexity of adaptive personalization layers, synthetic data, and hallucination feedback, we will explore:\n- Hybrid federated-centralized approaches where certain model components or synthetic data generative models are centrally coordinated.\n- Progressive privacy budget tuning and synthetic data generation refinement to optimize privacy-utility trade-offs.\n- Incorporation of robust aggregation techniques resilient to adversarial or noisy updates.\n- Leveraging transfer learning from pre-trained financial LLMs to improve starting points and reduce required federated iterations.\n- Alternative domain adaptation strategies, such as meta-learning, to alleviate personalization complexity while maintaining privacy guarantees."

Key points such as how personalization layers are trained without compromising privacy, how differential privacy noise affects model utility locally and globally, and the operationalization of hallucination evaluation feedback need explicit clarification. Strengthening this clarity will enhance the soundness and reproducibility of the method and bolster confidence in its feasibility under realistic institutional constraints, especially given the complexity of financial data and compliance requirements. Please provide a more formalized system architecture and algorithmic workflow illustrating these interactions and privacy-preserving guarantees in detail within the Proposed_Method section. This will also help anticipate potential pitfalls in optimization and convergence behavior specific to the adaptive and privacy-preserving nature of the framework, which are currently left vague and assumed to work well together without rigorous justification or risk management strategies (e.g., in cases of heterogeneity or adversarial updates)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating and overlapping prior work, integrating synthetic data generation techniques or leveraging knowledge graphs could notably enhance the framework's novelty and impact. For example, employing generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create privacy-preserving synthetic financial data could supplement the federated updates and mitigate data heterogeneity. Alternatively, incorporating knowledge graphs encoding institutional domain expertise may improve personalization layers by explicitly modeling relationships between financial entities across institutions without direct data sharing. These additions would deepen the methodological innovation and potentially improve model generalization and robustness. I suggest exploring these linked concepts to extend the proposed federated learning architecture, thereby positioning it more distinctly against existing approaches and broadening practical applicability beyond initial test cases."
