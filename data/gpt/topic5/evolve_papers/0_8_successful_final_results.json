        "title": "Constrained MDP-Based Multi-Agent Meta-Learned Fact-Checking System with Adaptive Reinforcement for Financial LLM Outputs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Conventional static and single-layer fact-checking systems fail to effectively track and validate rapidly evolving financial information, leading to persistent hallucinations and inaccurate advice from LLM outputs. Existing meta-learning approaches lack clarity and rigor in multi-level verification mechanisms and do not systematically manage risk and uncertainty inherent to financial claim verification.",
        "Motivation": "To address both internal methodological gaps and limited novelty in prior art, this proposal presents a formally defined, multi-agent meta-learned fact-checking framework modeled as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). This enables principled optimization under uncertainty and risk constraints reflecting factual correctness and downstream user trust. By integrating agent communication protocols and a robust reward model balancing factual accuracy with trust metrics across specialized verification agents, the approach advances novelty and scalability for dynamic financial LLM output validation, pushing beyond typical single-agent, flat verification systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hierarchical multi-agent system composed of specialized fact-checker agents operating at different verification levels—from surface text checks to deep semantic validation against financial databases. Each agent is meta-learned to adapt quickly to evolving financial data streams. The overall fact-checking adaptation is modeled as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) where the state encodes the current verification context and financial environment; actions correspond to verification strategies or inter-agent communication directives; and constraints enforce limits on risk (false positives/negatives) and latency. A reward model jointly optimizes factual accuracy and user trust outcomes captured via market reactions and regulatory feedback. Agents communicate using defined protocols enabling collaboration—sharing intermediate findings and uncertainty estimates to refine joint decisions. Reinforcement learning with CMDP solvers updates the meta-learners, integrating feedback loops that adapt policies considering multi-level verification signals and constraints. We will provide a schematic diagram and pseudocode outlining agent interactions, CMDP components, and learning update cycles to clarify the architecture and facilitate reproducibility. This formal and modular design improves adaptability, robustness, and scalability to dynamically changing financial facts and multi-dimensional correctness criteria.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct comprehensive evolving financial fact datasets annotated for multiple verification levels; 2) Design and implement the hierarchical multi-agent fact-checking system architecture with agent communication protocols; 3) Formalize the CMDP components, define reward models blending factual and trust signaling, and implement constrained reinforcement learning algorithms; 4) Train baseline single-agent and meta-learned multi-agent fact-checkers under non-constrained and CMDP settings; 5) Simulate real-time financial information shifts and measure adaptability, hallucination reduction, and compliance with risk constraints; 6) Validate inter-agent communication impact and system scalability; 7) Deploy on LLM financial advice outputs and benchmark improvements in downstream user trust and factual robustness relative to prior methods.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: 'Company R's market share increased by 10% this quarter.' The surface-level agent first verifies literal numerical claims from recent quarterly reports; the semantic agent cross-validates trends against market databases and official filings; communication protocols enable agents to exchange uncertainty metrics and verification results; the CMDP framework evaluates verification actions under risk constraints to produce a final adaptive verdict. As new quarterly data arrives, reinforcement signals including market reactions and regulatory updates update policies, enabling prompt correction of potentially hallucinated claims by the LLM output.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the complexity of CMDP-based multi-agent reinforcement learning proves infeasible, we will revert to an ensemble of periodically updated meta-learned fact-checkers employing modular verification units coordinated via rule-based communication protocols. Human-in-the-loop mechanisms will be integrated for supervisory feedback to approximate constrained optimization objectives and maintain adaptation capabilities, ensuring practical efficacy in dynamic financial environments."

Specifically, how these levels interoperate and how reinforcement signals are concretely defined, measured, and fed back into the meta-learner is not sufficiently detailed. It is crucial to clarify the architecture, the interaction between levels, and the precise reinforcement learning setup to assess soundness and enable reproducibility. Providing a schematic or pseudo-algorithm would improve understanding and strengthen this section significantly, reducing ambiguity in the core method design and ensuring that adaptive hallucination correction is well grounded and viable to implement efficiently on dynamic financial data streams. This clarification should be prioritized before further experimental validation steps advance, to avoid foundational uncertainties later on. Target Section: Proposed_Method"

For instance, modeling the fact-checking meta-learner's adaptation as a constrained MDP could allow rigorous handling of uncertainty and risk in verifying financial claims, optimizing reward models that reflect both factual accuracy and downstream user trust metrics. Additionally, exploring 'agent communication protocols' can enable modular collaboration among fact-checkers specialized in different financial domains or verification levels, improving scalability and robustness. Employing these globally linked concepts will help differentiate the approach and open new avenues for knowledge discovery and management within financial LLM output validation pipelines. Detailed suggestions and potential architectures employing these concepts should be incorporated to augment both novelty and impact. Target Section: Proposed_Method"
