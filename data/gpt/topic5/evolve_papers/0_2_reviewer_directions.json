    "title": "Blockchain-Enabled Transparent Audit Trail for AI-Driven Financial Advice",
    "Problem_Statement": "The opaqueness of LLM-generated financial advice hinders regulatory compliance and user trust due to the lack of auditable, tamper-proof explanation and provenance tracking.",
    "Motivation": "By bridging finance AI with blockchain-based transparency tools (an external gap), this project aims to develop an immutable audit trail for AI advisories, improving ethical adoption, compliance verification, and organizational trust frameworks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a hybrid system where every AI-generated financial advisory output is hashed and stored on a permissioned blockchain alongside metadata detailing data sources, rationale keywords, and explainability reports derived from model attention logs. Financial institutions can query this ledger for compliance audits or dispute resolution, reinforcing accountability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop LLM advisory system with explainability output; 2) Implement blockchain ledger prototype using Hyperledger Fabric; 3) Integrate automatic recording of advisory metadata; 4) Test latency, scalability, and security; 5) Conduct pilot usage scenarios with compliance officers evaluating audit utility.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Advice to invest in fund ABC due to projected growth. Blockchain ledger entry shows data origin, model attention highlights on key financial indicators, timestamp, and unique hash ensuring immutability.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain integration proves too resource-intensive, fallback to cryptographically signed off-chain logs with periodic blockchain anchoring for a balance between transparency and efficiency."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines hashing and storing metadata on a permissioned blockchain to create an immutable audit trail. However, the explanation lacks specificity on how model attention logs and rationale keywords are extracted and systematically transformed into meaningful explainability reports. Clarify the process and criteria for generating these explainability artifacts, including how you ensure their interpretability and relevance to compliance or dispute resolution. Additionally, detail security considerations to protect sensitive financial data on the blockchain, especially given permissioned but possibly multi-institutional access, ensuring privacy alongside transparency is maintained without compromising functionality or regulatory requirements. Strengthen the technical clarity of this hybrid system's inner workings and data flows to establish soundness of the mechanism fully in the context of financial AI advisory auditing rather than a conceptual overview only.\n\n"

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan provides a logical progression from system development to pilot evaluations. Nonetheless, it omits key technical feasibility considerations and quantitative evaluation criteria such as performance benchmarks on latency and scalability for real-world financial environments, the robustness of cryptographic protections, and resilience against tampering or blockchain forks. It is essential to define precise success metrics for each step, especially for the blockchain integration phase, and to consider potential trade-offs between blockchain overhead and system responsiveness. Additionally, outline fallback mechanisms in more detail in case resource intensity or integration complexity arise, ensuring the plan can adapt technically without sacrificing audit trail integrity. Enhancing experimental design with measurable targets and contingency protocols will improve confidence in the proposed method's practical deployability in operational financial compliance settings."
