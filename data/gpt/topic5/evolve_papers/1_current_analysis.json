The paper presents several ethical issues in existing computing domain and how ChatGPT can invoke challenges to such notion. This work also includes some biases and limitations of ChatGPT. It is worth to note that despite of several controversies and ethical concerns, ChatGPT has attracted remarkable attentions from academia, research, and industries in a very short span of time.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'ChatGPT for good? On opportunities and challenges of large language models for education', 'abstract': 'Large language models represent a significant advancement in the field of AI. The underlying technology is key to further innovations and, despite critical views and even bans within communities and regions, large language models are here to stay. This commentary presents the potential benefits and challenges of educational applications of large language models, from student and teacher perspectives. We briefly discuss the current state of large language models and their applications. We then highlight how these models can be used to create educational content, improve student engagement and interaction, and personalize learning experiences. With regard to challenges, we argue that large language models in education require teachers and learners to develop sets of competencies and literacies necessary to both understand the technology as well as their limitations and unexpected brittleness of such systems. In addition, a clear strategy within educational systems and a clear pedagogical approach with a strong focus on critical thinking and strategies for fact checking are required to integrate and take full advantage of large language models in learning settings and teaching curricula. Other challenges such as the potential bias in the output, the need for continuous human oversight, and the potential for misuse are not unique to the application of AI in education. But we believe that, if handled sensibly, these challenges can offer insights and opportunities in education scenarios to acquaint students early on with potential societal biases, criticalities, and risks of AI applications. We conclude with recommendations for how to address these challenges and ensure that such models are used in a responsible and ethical manner in education.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Collaborating With ChatGPT: Considering the Implications of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Journalism and Media Education', 'abstract': 'Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is ushering in an era of potential transformation of journalism and media content. This essay considers one notable generative AI platform called ChatGPT made available to the public in 2022 for free use. ChatGPT allows users to enter text prompts and rapidly generates text responses drawn from its knowledge acquired via machine learning in engagement with the internet. This essay is coauthored by a human journalism and media professor in collaboration with ChatGPT. The essay demonstrates the capacity and limitations of ChatGPT and offers reflections on the implications of generative AI for journalism and media education.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'The Digital Divide: Addressing Artificial Intelligence in Communication Education', 'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained both momentum and importance within society over the past several years. This article provides an opening for further discussion to the broader social and digital media research community and those interested in answering important questions related to these areas by leveraging a focused, productive approach. In supporting future educational endeavors within the communication classroom, and specifically to this topic, we propose five important considerations that will move the conversation forward. The considerations within this article are meant to engage scholars in intellectual conversation and to provide an initial foundation for the direction of communication education. They are not meant to be an exhaustive list, but rather initiate discussions within education and research addressing implications emerging technologies have had on our field and what could be incorporated into the media and communication curriculum to prepare educators and students alike.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Automatic Generation of Programming Exercises and Code Explanations Using Large Language Models', 'abstract': 'This article explores the natural language generation capabilities of large language models with application to the production of two types of learning resources common in programming courses. Using OpenAI Codex as the large language model, we create programming exercises (including sample solutions and test cases) and code explanations, assessing these qualitatively and quantitatively. Our results suggest that the majority of the automatically generated content is both novel and sensible, and in some cases ready to use as is. When creating exercises we find that it is remarkably easy to influence both the programming concepts and the contextual themes they contain, simply by supplying keywords as input to the model. Our analysis suggests that there is significant value in massive generative machine learning models as a tool for instructors, although there remains a need for some oversight to ensure the quality of the generated content before it is delivered to students. We further discuss the implications of OpenAI Codex and similar tools for introductory programming education and highlight future research streams that have the potential to improve the quality of the educational experience for both teachers and students alike.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Large pre-trained language models contain human-like biases of what is right and wrong to do', 'abstract': 'Artificial writing is permeating our lives due to recent advances in large-scale, transformer-based language models (LMs) such as BERT, GPT-2 and GPT-3. Using them as pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art for many natural language processing tasks and shown that they capture not only linguistic knowledge but also retain general knowledge implicitly present in the data. Unfortunately, LMs trained on unfiltered text corpora suffer from degenerated and biased behaviour. While this is well established, we show here that recent LMs also contain human-like biases of what is right and wrong to do, reflecting existing ethical and moral norms of society. We show that these norms can be captured geometrically by a ‘moral direction’ which can be computed, for example, by a PCA, in the embedding space. The computed ‘moral direction’ can rate the normativity (or non-normativity) of arbitrary phrases without explicitly training the LM for this task, reflecting social norms well. We demonstrate that computing the ’moral direction’ can provide a path for attenuating or even preventing toxic degeneration in LMs, showcasing this capability on the RealToxicityPrompts testbed.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'A neural network solves, explains, and generates university math problems by program synthesis and few-shot learning at human level', 'abstract': \"We demonstrate that a neural network pretrained on text and fine-tuned on code solves mathematics course problems, explains solutions, and generates questions at a human level. We automatically synthesize programs using few-shot learning and OpenAI's Codex transformer and execute them to solve course problems at 81% automatic accuracy. We curate a dataset of questions from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s largest mathematics courses (Single Variable and Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, Introduction to Probability and Statistics, Linear Algebra, and Mathematics for Computer Science) and Columbia University's Computational Linear Algebra. We solve questions from a MATH dataset (on Prealgebra, Algebra, Counting and Probability, Intermediate Algebra, Number Theory, and Precalculus), the latest benchmark of advanced mathematics problems designed to assess mathematical reasoning. We randomly sample questions and generate solutions with multiple modalities, including numbers, equations, and plots. The latest GPT-3 language model pretrained on text automatically solves only 18.8% of these university questions using zero-shot learning and 30.8% using few-shot learning and the most recent chain of thought prompting. In contrast, program synthesis with few-shot learning using Codex fine-tuned on code generates programs that automatically solve 81% of these questions. Our approach improves the previous state-of-the-art automatic solution accuracy on the benchmark topics from 8.8 to 81.1%. We perform a survey to evaluate the quality and difficulty of generated questions. This work automatically solves university-level mathematics course questions at a human level and explains and generates university-level mathematics course questions at scale, a milestone for higher education.\"}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': '“So what if ChatGPT wrote it?” Multidisciplinary perspectives on opportunities, challenges and implications of generative conversational AI for research, practice and policy', 'abstract': 'Transformative artificially intelligent tools, such as ChatGPT, designed to generate sophisticated text indistinguishable from that produced by a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT’s capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT’s use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'ChatGPT is fun, but not an author', 'abstract': 'In less than 2 months, the artificial intelligence (AI) program ChatGPT has become a cultural sensation. It is freely accessible through a web portal created by the tool\\'s developer, OpenAI. The program-which automatically creates text based on written prompts-is so popular that it\\'s likely to be \"at capacity right now\" if you attempt to use it. When you do get through, ChatGPT provides endless entertainment. I asked it to rewrite the first scene of the classic American play <i>Death of a Salesman</i>, but to feature Princess Elsa from the animated movie <i>Frozen</i> as the main character instead of Willy Loman. The output was an amusing conversation in which Elsa-who has come home from a tough day of selling-is told by her son Happy, \"Come on, Mom. You\\'re Elsa from <i>Frozen</i>. You have ice powers and you\\'re a queen. You\\'re unstoppable.\" Mash-ups like this are certainly fun, but there are serious implications for generative AI programs like ChatGPT in science and academia.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'ChatGPT for (Finance) research: The Bananarama Conjecture', 'abstract': 'We show, based on ratings by finance journal reviewers of generated output, that the recently released AI chatbot ChatGPT can significantly assist with finance research. In principle, these results should be generalisable across research domains. There are clear advantages for idea generation and data identification. The technology, however, is weaker on literature synthesis and developing appropriate testing frameworks. Importantly, we further demonstrate that the extent of private data and researcher domain expertise input, are key factors in determining the quality of output. We conclude by considering the implications, particularly the ethical implications, which arise from this new technology.'}]\n```\n\n**Part A.2: The Evolution Links (Edges of the Graph):**\nThe following list defines the citation relationships between the papers in Part A.

Two-Step Process\nYour task involves an internal analysis step followed by a final report generation step.\n\n**Step 1: Internal Analysis & Synthesis (Your thought process - DO NOT include this in the final output)**\nFirst, mentally trace the 'Evolution Links' (A.2) to understand the narrative of scientific progress. Analyze how the core problems and methods have evolved through the papers (A.1). Synthesize this evolutionary understanding with the local (Part B) and global (Part C) context. This deep understanding will be the foundation for your final report.\n\n**Step 2: Generate the Final Research Landscape Map (This is your ONLY output)**\nNow, based on the deep insights gained from your internal analysis in Step 1, generate a concise and insightful report. The report **MUST** contain ONLY the following three sections:\n\n**1. Current Research Landscape & Core Consensus:**\n- What is the central problem and dominant methodology of the **current** state-of-the-art? Your summary should reflect the insights from the evolutionary analysis (e.g., 'the current focus on X is a direct response to the limitations of the earlier Y').\n- Use the Central Nodes (B.1) and Thematic Islands (B.2) to support your summary.\n\n**2. Critical Gaps & Unexplored Frontiers:**\n- **Internal Gaps:** What limitations are present in the recent papers? What weaknesses are revealed by the overall evolutionary trajectory (e.g., 'the field has consistently overlooked problem Z throughout its evolution')?\n- **External/Novel Gaps:** Based on the Global Context (Part C), what novel connections or cross-disciplinary approaches have been overlooked?\n\n**3. High-Potential Innovation Opportunities:**\n- Based on the identified gaps, propose 2-3 high-level, innovative research directions.\n- Each opportunity should be justified by linking a Global Opportunity (from Part C) with a problem or limitation identified in your analysis.\n",

There is a strong emphasis on improving human-AI interaction by advancing conversational agents and integrating ethical considerations, including bias identification and mitigation. This focus results from recognizing the limitations and ethical challenges posed by unfiltered pre-training data that embed human-like societal biases and toxic degeneration risks. Current efforts reveal a shift towards multidisciplinary approaches involving digital transformation of organizations, personalized learning, and enhanced decision support tools that maintain safety and fairness, supported by computational evaluations of model normativity (e.g., moral direction embeddings).",
    "critical_gaps": "Internally, the literature reveals persistent gaps including insufficient mechanisms to robustly detect and mitigate subtle, context-specific biases in high-stakes healthcare applications. Existing approaches often overlook the unique ethical challenges when deploying LLMs as clinical decision support tools, such as transparency in moral reasoning, explainability of outputs, and integration with domain expert oversight. Furthermore, while few-shot learning and program synthesis show promise, their adaptability to rare or less-represented clinical scenarios remains underexplored. There is also a notable scarcity of empirical studies addressing how healthcare providers' digital competencies and human-AI trust dynamics influence model use and safety. Externally, the global GPS analysis identifies overlooked opportunities to cross-pollinate with fields such as clinical nursing education, computational pathology, and precision medicine by incorporating sophisticated AI acceptance theories and ethical frameworks from theology and performing arts (e.g., narrative ethical reasoning). Moreover, bridging concepts like 'Transformer-based language models' with 'digital transformation of organisations' and 'generative artificial intelligence' point to untapped avenues in healthcare system workflows and policy governance, which are not yet fully integrated into fairness research. The cultural and ethical dimensions revealed by linking clinical AI with narrative and theatrical paradigms ('Willy Loman') suggest novel frameworks for improving bias awareness and stigma-reduction in AI outputs.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "1. Development of Explainable and Context-Aware Moral Reasoning Frameworks for Healthcare LLMs: Leveraging the concept of a 'moral direction' in embedding spaces, combined with ethical perspectives from humanities and theology, to create transparent bias monitors and ethically grounded output filters tailored to complex clinical decision contexts. This addresses internal gaps related to ethical transparency and mitigates risks seen in toxic degeneration and normativity failures.\n\n2. Integrative Human-AI Collaborative Models Embedding Digital Competence and Trust Dynamics: Combining insights from digital transformation studies and nursing education, research can explore frameworks that embed healthcare professionals’ digital literacy, trust calibration, and continuous oversight to ensure safe and fair clinical decision support. This targets the gap between technical bias mitigation and real-world deployment conditions.\n\n3. Cross-Disciplinary Synthesis of Narrative Ethics and AI Fairness in Clinical AI: Inspired by the bridge concepts linking transformer models with performing arts and education, research can investigate narrative-based methods to uncover hidden biases and cultural assumptions in healthcare AI outputs. These methods would enable richer bias detection and patient-centered fairness metrics, broadening the scope beyond traditional quantitative bias measures and connecting the socio-cultural dimensions into LLM fairness assessment."
