    "title": "Cognitive-Driven Adaptive Intent Recovery",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM-based autonomous customer service agents lack scalable, user-personalized recovery frameworks that can dynamically adapt to evolving adversarial tactics based on real-time user intent feedback. This leads to brittle responses and poor resilience in naturalistic interactions.",
    "Motivation": "This addresses the internal gap of insufficient recovery personalization and lack of user-centric dynamic feedback loops by integrating cognitive science theories on human error correction into adaptive adversarial recovery frameworks, a high-potential innovation opportunity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid system combining a cognitive error model that predicts user frustration and misunderstandings with an adaptive adversarial recovery module. The system continuously captures real-time user interactions and feedback signals (e.g., sentiment shifts, repetition) to tailor recovery strategies by updating intent hypotheses dynamically. The architecture leverages a dual-loop feedback design: a fast loop for immediate correction and a slow loop for policy adjustments, inspired by human cognitive error correction.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data collection of adversarial user interactions with customer agents, annotated for intent shifts and frustration.\n2) Implementation of a cognitive error predictor module trained on such data.\n3) Integration with an LLM-based autonomous agent enhanced by an adaptive recovery layer.\n4) Baselines include standard adversarial training and static recovery.\n5) Evaluation metrics: robustness to adversarial attacks, recovery success rate, user satisfaction via simulated feedback.\n6) Ablations to isolate cognitive module effects.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User repeatedly asks \"Why is my bill so high?\" with increasing frustration.\nExpected output: The agent recognizes rising frustration, adapts intent hypotheses, and invokes customized recovery, e.g., offers detailed billing explanation and escalates if dissatisfaction persists.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cognitive error prediction is insufficient, fallback to heuristic sentiment-based triggers for recovery adaptation. Also, experiment with reinforcement learning to refine dynamic intent adaptation policies."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a promising dual-loop cognitive modeling and adaptive recovery design, but lacks detailed explication of how real-time user feedback signals (e.g., sentiment shifts, repetition) will be quantitatively integrated to dynamically update intent hypotheses. Clarify algorithmic specifics or model architectures underpinning the cognitive error predictor and how it interacts with the LLM agent’s intent representation. This is critical to assess theoretical soundness and reproducibility. Consider formalizing the cognitive error model’s predictive mechanism and precisely defining the feedback update rules for the fast and slow loops to ensure the method's operational clarity and robustness evaluation approach are rigorous and interpretable; target explainability alongside adaptation accuracy to strengthen trustworthiness in adversarial contexts. The current vague framing risks implementation ambiguity and weakens confidence in the mechanism’s internal validity under varied adversarial behaviors and user states, which the submission aims to address as a core contribution."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty screening result and the high competition in integrating cognitive modeling with LLM adversarial recovery, consider augmenting the system by incorporating ‘user intention’ modeling with graph neural networks (GNN) to capture complex relational dynamics between user intents, historical interactions, and context states beyond sequential feedback signals. This could provide a richer structural representation for adaptive recovery policy adjustments, potentially improving intent hypothesis updating and supporting multi-turn intent disambiguation under adversarial user behavior. Leveraging GNNs aligns with globally linked concepts and may significantly enhance both robustness and personalization, thereby increasing the work’s novelty and impact among intelligent system research efforts. This integration could also facilitate knowledge transfer across related domains such as multimodal or networked user interaction data, broadening potential application scenarios and addressing the [NOV-COMPETITIVE] assessment."
