    "title": "Adaptive Ethical Prompt Engineering for Context-Sensitive Bias Mitigation in Healthcare LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Standard few-shot learning and prompt engineering fail to dynamically adjust to evolving clinical context biases, limiting bias mitigation effectiveness.",
    "Motivation": "Advances internal gaps related to few-shot adaptability and external insights on ethical grounding, by creating context-sensitive adaptive prompt engineering driven by real-time ethical feedback.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an adaptive prompt generation module that integrates continuous moral direction feedback and clinician annotations, generating dynamic prompts embedding ethical constraints specific to clinical subdomains and scenarios. The LLM thus receives tailored, context-aware guidance improving fairness and reducing toxic degeneration risks in generation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect annotated datasets with varying clinical contexts and documented bias issues. 2) Implement moral feedback loops based on embedding deviations and clinician evaluations. 3) Train a prompt generator conditioned on context features and feedback signals. 4) Evaluate model bias reduction, output quality, and adaptability across scenarios.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A cardiology consultation scenario prompt. The adaptive engine appends ethical constraints specifically addressing known cardiology-related demographic biases, guiding the LLM output accordingly.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive prompting lacks robustness, combine it with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) targeting fairness rewards for stable improvements."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an adaptive prompt generation module guided by continuous moral feedback and clinician annotations. However, the mechanism by which this module integrates diverse and potentially conflicting ethical signals into coherent, context-sensitive prompts is insufficiently detailed. It is critical to clarify the architecture, algorithms, or models used for synthesizing feedback into prompt modifications, including how real-time updates are computed and validated. Without a clear, rigorous explanation, the method risks being underspecified and difficult to reproduce or extend, limiting confidence in its soundness and the practical feasibility of the adaptive prompting approach in complex clinical environments. Further elaboration on the integration strategy and conflict resolution among ethical directives is strongly recommended to strengthen this core component's justification and clarity (Proposed_Method)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the competitive novelty assessment, integrating federated learning and human-in-the-loop approaches could significantly enhance the idea's impact and novelty. Specifically, employing federated learning would allow the adaptive prompt system to be trained and updated across multiple health systems without compromising patient data privacy, addressing a crucial barrier in healthcare AI deployment. Coupling this with structured human-in-the-loop processes for continuous clinical and ethical oversight can enhance moral feedback reliability and model adaptability. Embedding such concepts would broaden applicability, addressing real-world ethical compliance and acceptance challenges and creating a more robust, scalable, and deployable system. Including discussion and plans for these integrations would position the work competitively within the current research landscape (Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan)."
