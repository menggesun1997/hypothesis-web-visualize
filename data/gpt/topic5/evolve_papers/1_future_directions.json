        "title": "Multimodal Ethical Embedding Spaces for Contextual Bias Detection in Healthcare LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM fairness approaches lack robust, context-sensitive mechanisms to detect subtle biases in complex healthcare scenarios, leading to unreliable clinical decision support outputs.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient context-aware bias detection by innovatively expanding moral direction embeddings with multimodal clinical data and ethical narrative inputs, bridging transformer language models and narrative ethics.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a framework that integrates multimodal embeddings—textual clinical notes, imaging metadata, and patient socio-cultural narratives—mapped into an augmented moral direction space informed by thematic ethical narratives from healthcare humanities and performing arts. This embedding space will serve as a dynamic monitor of model outputs, flagging ethically fraught content by measuring deviations from learned moral direction vectors sensitive to context and culture.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate a multimodal healthcare dataset with aligned clinical text, diagnostic images, and patient narrative transcripts including socio-cultural context. 2) Pre-train embeddings using transformer architectures separately for each modality, then align them into a joint ethical embedding space using contrastive learning augmented with ethical labels derived from humanities experts. 3) Implement bias detection modules that quantify deviations within this space during LLM output generation. 4) Evaluate on benchmark clinical NLP datasets for bias detection, and qualitatively with clinician and ethicist review. Metrics include detection precision, recall, and context sensitivity score.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A clinical summary mentioning treatment recommendations for a minority ethnic patient. Expected output: The model’s explanation is flagged if it subtly implies stereotypical assumptions or exclusionary recommendations, supported by the ethical embedding deviations, allowing transparent clinician feedback.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal alignment is unstable, fallback to unimodal ethical embeddings from clinical text only, enriched with synthetic narrative augmentation and human-in-the-loop annotation, while iteratively refining the embedding space with expert feedback."

        "Problem_Statement": "Healthcare providers’ varying digital competencies and trust in AI interventions lead to inconsistent adoption and safety risks of LLM-based clinical decision tools.",
        "Motivation": "Directly addresses the external gap concerning human-AI trust dynamics and digital competence by embedding adaptive interaction strategies personalized to clinician profiles derived from digital transformation and nursing education theories.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design an AI-augmented decision support system that dynamically assesses clinician digital literacy and trust propensity through brief contextual quizzes and interaction patterns. Using this profile, the system modulates the explanation complexity, transparency depth, and intervention assertiveness of the LLM outputs. Integrate continuous trust recalibration mechanisms via embedded feedback loops and explainable moral reasoning overlays to foster calibrated reliance and oversight.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect datasets on healthcare professionals’ digital literacy and trust in AI through surveys and simulated clinical tasks. 2) Develop profiling algorithms and integrate them into the LLM interface. 3) Train the system to adjust output explanations and transparency tokens based on profile input. 4) Conduct controlled user studies in simulated clinical decision-making settings, comparing trust calibration, decision accuracy, and cognitive load against static LLM interfaces.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A junior nurse with low digital competency receives a diagnostic suggestion. The system provides a simplified explanation and offers supplemental educational resources, increasing safety and confidence. Conversely, an experienced physician views detailed moral reasoning chains and optional protocol references.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If profiling proves insufficiently predictive, introduce adaptive learning over time from observed user corrections and trust signals, allowing the system to self-tune interaction styles without explicit profiles."

        "Motivation": "Targets the external gap relating to the integration of narrative ethics and performing arts into AI fairness assessment, translating abstract theatrical concepts into practical bias auditing tools.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create a narrative-based ethical auditing toolkit that converts LLM-generated clinical outputs into structured narratives resembling stage scripts. Utilizing theatrical frameworks such as character motivation analysis and scene staging metaphors, the toolkit identifies hidden bias triggers and moral dissonance. The tool applies computational narrative mining algorithms aligned with equity-focused ethical principles to generate culture-sensitive fairness scores and actionable revision recommendations.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Assemble a corpus of healthcare dialogues and discharge notes annotated for cultural biases and stigmatization. 2) Develop narrative conversion pipelines mapping text to narrative structures informed by theatrical models. 3) Implement bias detection algorithms highlighting problematic 'characters' (entities), 'plots' (clinical courses), and 'acts' (decision sequences). 4) Validate the toolkit against traditional fairness metrics and clinician cultural competency assessments.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient discharge summary referencing adherence likelihood. The toolkit reveals implicit blame themes potentially stigmatizing minority groups, suggesting alternative phrasing that reduces cultural bias while preserving clinical meaning.",

Couple this with a multi-objective few-shot fine-tuning process where the LLM not only optimizes for predictive accuracy but also for fairness metrics derived from exposure to these synthetic rare cases. Incorporate fairness regularizers enforcing equity across demographic and clinical strata.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather real-world rare clinical event datasets and create ethical annotation guidelines. 2) Train controlled generation modules to produce synthetic cases matching the rare scenario distribution, validated by clinicians. 3) Fine-tune LLMs with these synthetic cases under fairness-aware loss functions. 4) Evaluate accuracy, robustness, and fairness on real and synthetic rare case benchmarks, including subgroup performance analysis.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Rare genetic disorder case input prompt. Expected output: Diagnostic support free from demographic bias, with transparent probability calibration and fairness-aware recommendations.",

        "Motivation": "Combines human oversight with narrative and theatrical frameworks to create engaging, transparent interfaces supporting continuous bias calibration in clinical AI.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design an interactive dashboard that visualizes LLM outputs as performative scenes, allowing healthcare experts to review, annotate, and simulate alternative dialogues using theatrical techniques such as role reversal and script rewriting. The system translates expert interventions into model adjustment signals, fostering iterative bias mitigation and fairness improvement informed by human intuition and cultural insight.",
