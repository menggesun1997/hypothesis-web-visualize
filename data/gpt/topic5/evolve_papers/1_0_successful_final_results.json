    "title": "Multimodal Ethical Embedding Spaces for Contextual Bias Detection in Healthcare LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM fairness approaches lack robust, context-sensitive mechanisms to detect subtle biases in complex healthcare scenarios, leading to unreliable clinical decision support outputs.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient context-aware bias detection by innovatively expanding moral direction embeddings with multimodal clinical data and ethical narrative inputs, bridging transformer language models and narrative ethics.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a framework that integrates multimodal embeddings—textual clinical notes, imaging metadata, and patient socio-cultural narratives—mapped into an augmented moral direction space informed by thematic ethical narratives from healthcare humanities and performing arts. This embedding space will serve as a dynamic monitor of model outputs, flagging ethically fraught content by measuring deviations from learned moral direction vectors sensitive to context and culture.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate a multimodal healthcare dataset with aligned clinical text, diagnostic images, and patient narrative transcripts including socio-cultural context. 2) Pre-train embeddings using transformer architectures separately for each modality, then align them into a joint ethical embedding space using contrastive learning augmented with ethical labels derived from humanities experts. 3) Implement bias detection modules that quantify deviations within this space during LLM output generation. 4) Evaluate on benchmark clinical NLP datasets for bias detection, and qualitatively with clinician and ethicist review. Metrics include detection precision, recall, and context sensitivity score.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A clinical summary mentioning treatment recommendations for a minority ethnic patient. Expected output: The model’s explanation is flagged if it subtly implies stereotypical assumptions or exclusionary recommendations, supported by the ethical embedding deviations, allowing transparent clinician feedback.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal alignment is unstable, fallback to unimodal ethical embeddings from clinical text only, enriched with synthetic narrative augmentation and human-in-the-loop annotation, while iteratively refining the embedding space with expert feedback."

        "title": "Multimodal Ethical Embedding Spaces with Federated Contrastive Learning for Contextual Bias Detection in Healthcare LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing fairness approaches for clinical large language models (LLMs) lack transparent, context-sensitive mechanisms to reliably detect subtle, culturally nuanced biases in complex healthcare settings, limiting trustworthiness and clinical adoption of AI-driven decision support.",
        "Motivation": "While prior methods address bias broadly, few incorporate rich sociocultural and ethical context at scale or handle multimodal clinical data integration with rigor. This work pioneers a novel, federated contrastive learning framework that quantitatively encodes ethical narratives from healthcare humanities, integrating them with multimodal clinical data in a unified embedding space. This interdisciplinary fusion bridges transformer LLMs, biomedical informatics, and narrative ethics to enable precise, context-aware bias flagging, surpassing existing approaches in sensitivity, interpretability, and real-world clinical applicability.",
        "Proposed_Method": "1) Data Sourcing & Ethical Labeling: We propose federated data collaboration with multiple healthcare institutions to curate a privacy-preserving multimodal dataset comprising aligned clinical texts, imaging metadata, and patient socio-cultural narratives derived via structured patient interviews and social media data mining for dementia care contexts, ensuring demographic diversity. Expert humanities scholars and clinicians will develop standardized, ontology-based ethical label schemas capturing thematic narrative ethics concepts (e.g., autonomy, beneficence, justice) to annotate samples. 2) Embedding Construction: Clinical textual and imaging data will be separately encoded using state-of-the-art transformer and CNN backbones. Ethical narratives will be quantitatively represented through specialized transformer embeddings trained on humanities corpora, employing topic modeling and thematic vector extraction to capture ethical semantics. 3) Integration via Federated Contrastive Learning: We will design a modality-aware contrastive learning objective that aligns patient-matched multimodal embeddings and ethical thematic vectors in a joint moral direction space. This objective incorporates semantic consistency constraints and noise-robust weighting to handle missing modalities and domain-specific noise. Federated learning ensures model generalization and patient privacy compliance across institutions. 4) Bias Detection Module: The system measures output deviations from learned ethical vectors, applying calibrated thresholds and context-sensitive filters differentiating subtle biases from benign clinical variations. Interpretability techniques, such as attention visualization and ethical concept attribution, facilitate clinician-in-the-loop validation and risk mitigation of false positives/negatives.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Establish federated agreements with multiple clinical sites ensuring IRB approval and data governance. 2) Collect and harmonize multimodal datasets including clinical notes, imaging metadata, and patient socio-cultural narratives, supplemented by social media data for dementia care contexts. 3) Humanities experts develop and validate ethical label ontologies; annotate an initial dataset subset for supervised training. 4) Train modality-specific encoders independently; develop ethical thematic embeddings from humanities corpora. 5) Implement federated contrastive learning with modality-specific noise handling, align embeddings into joint ethical space. 6) Deploy bias detection module integrated with clinical LLM outputs; conduct clinician and ethicist blind reviews to evaluate precision, recall, context sensitivity, reliability, and robustness across demographics and clinical contexts. 7) Conduct ablation studies comparing unimodal, multimodal, and federated learning variants; perform user studies on human-computer interaction effectiveness in clinical workflows.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical summary recommending treatment for a minority ethnic patient with dementia, including imaging reports and socio-cultural narrative transcripts. Expected outcome: The system flags subtle stereotypical biases in dosage or care assumptions by quantifying deviation in ethical embedding space toward justice and autonomy vectors, supported by explainable ethical attribution mapped for clinician feedback. Additional scenario includes differential detection performance on social media narratives reflecting culturally specific concerns to ensure fairness across demographics.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multimodal alignment via federated contrastive learning encounters instability or sparse annotations, fallback strategies include: a) Leveraging semi-supervised transfer learning from related biomedical and humanities datasets to augment embeddings, b) Prioritizing unimodal ethical embeddings from clinical text enriched by synthetic narrative augmentation using data generation techniques, and c) Implementing iterative expert-in-the-loop refinement cycles with active learning for annotation efficiency. Explorations of alternative robust integration methods such as graph-based embeddings or late fusion of modality-specific bias scores will be pursued to bolster system resilience."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method innovatively suggests integrating multimodal clinical data into a moral direction embedding space, but it lacks sufficient technical clarity on how the ethical narratives from healthcare humanities and performing arts will be quantitatively encoded and aligned with clinical embeddings. Clarify the concrete mechanisms and architectures for integrating heterogeneous modalities and ethically derived thematic vectors, and specify how semantic and ethical consistency across modalities will be maintained to ensure reliable bias detection outputs. Also, explicate how the approach will differentiate subtle contextual biases from benign variations in clinical recommendations to avoid false positives or negatives in detection toward clinical adoption readiness and reproducibility of the system implementation details and workflows are needed to fully assess soundness and operational validity of the method, this is essential given the novel integration intent and complexity involved in multimodal ethical embedding generation and downstream monitoring tasks within clinical LLMs' output spaces. For example, more detail on the choice and construction of the contrastive learning objective with ethical labels, and handling modality-specific noise or missing data, would strengthen methodological clarity and feasibility assumptions in this pioneering setting. Addressing this will validate the soundness of the method and build confidence in potential clinical deployment pathways and interdisciplinary bridging it aspires to achieve in contextual bias detection within healthcare LLMs contexts."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan ambitiously proposes curating a complex multimodal dataset combining clinical text, imaging metadata, and socio-cultural narratives, then pretraining and aligning embeddings using contrastive learning with ethically derived labels. While valuable, this plan underestimates significant practical challenges in data collection, including acquiring richly annotated patient socio-cultural narratives and imaging metadata aligned at the individual or episode level with clinical text. These data are rare, sensitive, and may involve complex privacy, consent, and annotation burdens. The plan would benefit from an expanded description of data sourcing strategies, access permissions, ethical considerations, and annotation protocols, particularly how humanities experts will systematically generate and validate ethical labels at scale, which is critical for supervised contrastive learning. Additionally, contingency plans beyond unimodal fallback could be detailed to handle multimodal alignment failures or sparse annotations, e.g., semi-supervised or transfer learning approaches. The evaluation metrics should explicitly include reliability and robustness analyses across different patient demographics and clinical contexts to ensure fairness and generalizability. Without sufficiently elaborated data collection and ethical labeling procedures and robustness-focused experimentation, the project's feasibility to fully realize the multimodal ethical embedding framework remains uncertain. Providing these details will ground the experimental plan in pragmatic realism, boosting confidence in successful implementation and impact measurement."
