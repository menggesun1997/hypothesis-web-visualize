    "title": "Personalized Recovery Feedback Loop via Cognitive User Profiling",
    "Problem_Statement": "Autonomous customer service agents lack dynamic, personalized recovery mechanisms that adapt to diverse user intents and cognitive error profiles during adversarial failures.",
    "Motivation": "To close the internal gap on personalization and dynamic feedback integration, this project proposes leveraging cognitive profiling of users to tailor recovery strategies uniquely, inspired by cognitive science and cross-disciplinary insights.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop user intent models enriched with cognitive profiles derived from interaction patterns and response behaviors (e.g., error tendencies, patience levels). The system maintains a personalized recovery policy per user archetype, learned and updated continuously using unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The agent selects recovery actions optimized for individual cognitive features, improving resilience and user experience.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate datasets with user metadata and interaction logs.\n2) Cluster users into cognitive profiles using behavioral features.\n3) Train personalized recovery policies per cluster.\n4) Evaluate on adversarial interaction datasets with stratified user groups.\n5) Metrics: recovery efficacy, user satisfaction, and adaptability across profiles.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user prone to impatience issues sends conflicting commands.\nExpected output: The agent uses a recovery approach focusing on concise, clear clarification steps minimizing interaction length.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cognitive profiling accuracy is low, implement adaptive meta-learning techniques to generalize recovery policies without explicit user profiles."
