    "title": "Multi-Modal Financial Advisory Framework Incorporating Real-Time News and Social Sentiment for Misinformation Detection",
    "Problem_Statement": "Financial LLMs relying solely on static training data risk hallucinations and outdated or misleading advice, especially given volatile market news and social sentiment dynamics.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the internal gap in hallucination detection, this project integrates multi-modal data streams—real-time financial news, social media sentiment, and structured market data—to dynamically validate and correct LLM advice, reducing misinformation risks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a pipeline that fuses LLM outputs with sentiment analysis modules analyzing live news and social media (Twitter, financial forums). Discrepancies between advisory claims and emerging sentiment triggers re-assessment or user alerts. Employ contrastive learning to align multi-modal signals with advisory truths.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect financial news, social media sentiment, and LLM outputs; 2) Develop sentiment analysis and anomaly detection modules; 3) Integrate with LLM advisory system; 4) Evaluate misinformation detection accuracy and real-time performance against static LLM baselines; 5) Conduct user trust and timeliness studies.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Company Q is seeing steady growth.' If live sentiment or news reports negative developments, system flags potential hallucination and provides updated advisory or cautionary note.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If live data integration is noisy or slow, fallback to periodic batch updating of advisory models or weighted reliance on structured financial indicators."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a high-level pipeline with LLM outputs fused with sentiment analysis and anomaly detection modules, but lacks sufficient mechanistic detail on how contrastive learning will be effectively applied to align multi-modal signals with advisory truths. Clarify the architecture, training data specifics, and the inference-time interplay between components to ensure sound integration and effective misinformation detection. For example, specify how real-time conflicting signals will trigger re-assessment and how the model handles ambiguous or conflicting data to prevent false alerts or degraded advisory quality, thus strengthening the method’s soundness and transparency of operations for replication and evaluation purposes. This detailed articulation is crucial given the complexity and real-time nature of the system, to build confidence in practical feasibility and reliability under volatile market conditions, which are not trivial challenges here. This should be prioritized before scaling or integration stages in the experimental plan to avoid compounded system errors later on, ensuring a robust foundation for the claimed hallucination detection improvements in financial LLMs presented in the Problem_Statement and Motivation sections.\n\nTarget: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "The presented Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is a sound overall flow but needs enhancement in handling the known challenges of noisy, real-time financial news and social media data often plagued by misinformation and rapid shifts. Explicitly incorporate strategies for data quality control, latency assessment, and system robustness evaluations, such as: 1) benchmark sentiment analysis on curated and adversarial datasets simulating misinformation, 2) characterize noise impact and processing delays with live feeds, 3) establish clear performance metrics and thresholds triggering fallback mode, and 4) plan for iterative adaptation or online fine-tuning under real operational conditions. Without these refinements, claims of misinformation detection accuracy and real-time performance risk being overly optimistic or not reproducible. Adding user trust and timeliness studies is a strength, but those must be aligned to realistic system constraints that the plan currently under-specifies. Improving these facets will enhance feasibility and make the research contribution clearer and more convincing for deployment in financial advisory settings sensitive to legal and ethical risk exposures described in the broader financial industry context.\n\nTarget: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"

          "feedback_content": "To strengthen novelty and broaden impact beyond the competitive multi-modal financial advisory space, integrate considerations from the Artificial Intelligence Act and Digital Services Act to enhance compliance and user rights protections in misinformation detection. Embedding legal duty and human rights law principles can provide a unique, multidisciplinary contribution by designing the framework not only for accuracy and timeliness but also for explainability, transparency, and accountability under emerging AI governance regulations. Additionally, proposing an ethical red team evaluation phase to proactively identify failure modes and systemic biases can differentiate this work and increase adoption by financial firms demanding trustworthy LLM-based advisory products. This global integration with these regulatory and legal frameworks can elevate the work from a technical demonstration to a comprehensive solution addressing market, societal, and legal challenges critical to real-world impact.\n\nTarget: Motivation"
