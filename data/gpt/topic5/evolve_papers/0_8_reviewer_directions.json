    "title": "Dynamic Multi-Level Fact-Checking System Based on Reinforced Meta-Learning for Financial LLM Outputs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Static methods fail to keep pace with rapidly changing financial data, causing outdated or hallucinated LLM advice.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gaps by introducing a novel reinforced meta-learning approach that dynamically adapts fact-checking models to evolving financial information, optimizing hallucination correction and improving advice relevance over time.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement meta-learned fact-checkers that update through reinforcement signals from live financial feedback (market reactions, regulatory updates). Employ multi-level verification from surface text fact-checks to deep semantic validation against financial databases. Feedback loops improve the fact-checker's adaptation speed and accuracy.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Construct fact-checking datasets with evolving financial facts; 2) Train baseline and meta-learned fact-checkers; 3) Simulate real-time financial changes; 4) Evaluate adaptability and hallucination reduction; 5) Deploy on LLM outputs and benchmark user trust.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: 'Company R's market share increased by 10%.' As new quarterly data arrives, fact-checker updates verification model and adjusts claim validity accordingly, correcting erroneous hallucinations promptly.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If meta-learning complexity is prohibitive, develop ensemble fact-checkers updated periodically with human-in-the-loop feedback."

          "feedback_content": "While the idea of meta-learned fact-checkers updating via reinforcement signals from live financial feedback is promising, the mechanism for integrating multi-level verification (surface text checks to deep semantic validation) lacks clarity. Specifically, how these levels interoperate and how reinforcement signals are concretely defined, measured, and fed back into the meta-learner is not sufficiently detailed. It is crucial to clarify the architecture, the interaction between levels, and the precise reinforcement learning setup to assess soundness and enable reproducibility. Providing a schematic or pseudo-algorithm would improve understanding and strengthen this section significantly, reducing ambiguity in the core method design and ensuring that adaptive hallucination correction is well grounded and viable to implement efficiently on dynamic financial data streams. This clarification should be prioritized before further experimental validation steps advance, to avoid foundational uncertainties later on. Target Section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "Given the competitive novelty assessment, to significantly enhance the idea's innovative contribution and impact, consider integrating concepts from 'Constrained Markov Decision Process' and 'reward model' to formalize the reinforcement learning framework. For instance, modeling the fact-checking meta-learner's adaptation as a constrained MDP could allow rigorous handling of uncertainty and risk in verifying financial claims, optimizing reward models that reflect both factual accuracy and downstream user trust metrics. Additionally, exploring 'agent communication protocols' can enable modular collaboration among fact-checkers specialized in different financial domains or verification levels, improving scalability and robustness. Employing these globally linked concepts will help differentiate the approach and open new avenues for knowledge discovery and management within financial LLM output validation pipelines. Detailed suggestions and potential architectures employing these concepts should be incorporated to augment both novelty and impact. Target Section: Proposed_Method"
