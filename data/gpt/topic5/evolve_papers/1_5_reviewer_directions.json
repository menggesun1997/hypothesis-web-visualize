    "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Bias Calibration Dashboard Incorporating Performing Arts Techniques",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing bias mitigation rarely incorporates continuous human expert input structured through culturally rich and intuitive interfaces, limiting contextual sensitivity.",
    "Motivation": "Combines human oversight with narrative and theatrical frameworks to create engaging, transparent interfaces supporting continuous bias calibration in clinical AI.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an interactive dashboard that visualizes LLM outputs as performative scenes, allowing healthcare experts to review, annotate, and simulate alternative dialogues using theatrical techniques such as role reversal and script rewriting. The system translates expert interventions into model adjustment signals, fostering iterative bias mitigation and fairness improvement informed by human intuition and cultural insight.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Prototype the dashboard interface embedding theatrical metaphors for data visualization. 2) Recruit healthcare professionals and ethicists for usability studies and iterative co-design. 3) Integrate expert feedback channels feeding back into bias-correction fine-tuning pipelines. 4) Evaluate improvements in bias detection rates, clinician satisfaction, and AI fairness metrics over time.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Scenario: A clinician detects a potentially stigmatizing AI-generated patient interaction. Using the dashboard, they enact alternative scenarios that reduce bias, updating the model’s parameters accordingly.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If the interactive performance paradigm is overly complex, deploy simplified annotation tools embedding narrative prompts for human feedback, emphasizing usability over creativity."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method introduces an innovative idea of visualizing LLM outputs as performative scenes and translating expert theatrical interventions into model adjustment signals. However, the mechanism bridging qualitative theatrical user input and quantitative model fine-tuning is currently insufficiently detailed. Clarify precisely how narrative-driven annotations (e.g., role reversal, script rewriting) will be operationalized into measurable model parameter updates. Explicitly explain the data representations, model components, and bias correction algorithms involved. This will ensure that the method is not only conceptually compelling but also technically sound and reproducible for bias mitigation in clinical AI contexts, where precision is critical to patient outcomes and fairness assessments. Adding technical schematics or pseudocode would strengthen this section significantly, making the interactive performance paradigm more concretely actionable rather than purely metaphorical or illustrative in nature.  Without this, the risk remains that the system is more performative storytelling than effective bias calibration tool, weakening soundness and real-world applicability."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a reasonable multi-phase approach involving prototyping, expert recruitment, feedback integration, and evaluation. However, it lacks granularity on how iterative human input via theatrical methods will quantitatively feed back into bias-correction fine-tuning pipelines. Specifically, the plan should detail how expert annotations and simulated dialogues are collected, validated, and incorporated into retraining or adjustment cycles — including metrics, timelines, data volume needs, and computational resources. Consider adding controlled experiments comparing the dashboard's influence against baseline annotation or bias correction methods to establish experimental rigor and feasibility. Moreover, address potential challenges such as recruiting sufficient domain experts for iterative cycles and ensuring consistency/quality of qualitative theatrical inputs. Strengthening these operational details will enhance feasibility confidence and make the plan scientifically credible and implementable for a premier conference context."
