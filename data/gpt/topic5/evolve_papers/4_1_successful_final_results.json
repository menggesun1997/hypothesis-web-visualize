    "title": "Sustainable Ethical Fine-Tuning Framework Incorporating ESG Metrics in Legal AI",
    "Problem_Statement": "Fine-tuning large language models for legal document analysis traditionally focuses on text accuracy and domain adaptation, neglecting the integration of ethical, sustainability, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) considerations vital for socially responsible AI deployment, potentially perpetuating biases and overlooking non-financial compliance issues.",
    "Motivation": "Aligning with the external critical gap, this research introduces sustainability and ethical AI governance principles drawn from commerce and management literature into the fine-tuning process for legal LLMs. By embedding ESG-related contextual features, the approach mitigates bias and enhances alignment with global corporate responsibility standards, a currently unexplored domain that bridges AI, legal tech, and ethical governance.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a fine-tuning pipeline that augments legal datasets with ESG annotations derived from sustainable finance and compliance reports. Train multi-objective models that balance legal accuracy with ESG compliance metrics using custom loss functions reflecting fairness, transparency, and ethical standards. Integrate explainability modules tracing ESG influence on model outputs. Use federated learning approaches to preserve sensitive data privacy across organizational boundaries while embedding ethical norms.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect and annotate legal documents with ESG-relevant tags, including bias indicators and sustainability compliance flags. 2. Develop multi-task learning architectures incorporating these ESG tasks alongside legal understanding. 3. Fine-tune baseline LLMs with the ESG-annotated corpus. 4. Measure performance on legal accuracy, bias metrics (e.g., demographic parity), and ESG compliance score alignment. 5. Conduct user studies with legal practitioners and compliance officers for qualitative validation. 6. Test federated fine-tuning across simulated organizational data silos.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Company policy documents with terms influencing employee rights and environmental impact. Expected output: An analysis highlighting legal compliance points alongside ESG considerations, flagging unethical clauses or sustainability risks, accompanied by explanation of ethical decisions informed by ESG embeddings.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-objective optimization deteriorates legal task performance, separate training phases can fine-tune for ESG compliance post-legal fine-tuning. Alternatively, utilize prompt augmentation strategies embedding ESG context without modifying core model weights to integrate ethical filters dynamically."

        "title": "A Concrete Multi-Objective Fine-Tuning Framework Integrating ESG Metrics with Legal AI Using Real-World Sustainability Data and Robotic Process Automation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) for legal document analysis predominantly emphasizes text accuracy and domain adaptation while overlooking explicit integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics crucial for ethical, sustainable AI in legal contexts. This gap risks perpetuating biases, ignoring non-financial compliance intricacies, and limits the model’s applicability for socially responsible legal AI systems that must align with evolving corporate governance and sustainability standards.",
        "Motivation": "To advance the state of ethical AI for legal NLP beyond foundational multi-objective techniques, this research concretely integrates ESG principles grounded in domain-specific frameworks and real-world datasets. Leveraging Singapore Management University’s sustainability and corporate social responsibility insights, alongside ESG compliance data from Spanish companies and investment funds, the work contextualizes ESG annotations within authentic legal and financial disclosure regimes. By embedding this domain-grounded ESG knowledge directly into model training and compliance workflows, and coupling it with Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to operationalize flagged ESG-legal discrepancies, the approach delivers novel, actionable legal AI tools. This unique interdisciplinary fusion enhances model accountability, fairness, and practical relevance, thus elevating the novelty and impact of legal LLM fine-tuning frameworks toward socially responsible AI deployment.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a rigorously specified multi-objective fine-tuning pipeline designed as follows: \n\n1. **Dataset Construction and ESG Annotation:** Collect legal documents including corporate policies, governance charters, and environmental disclosure reports sourced from Spanish companies and investment funds noted for ESG transparency, supplemented by corporate social responsibility guidelines curated by Singapore Management University. Annotate these texts with quantitative ESG indicators (e.g., environmental impact scores, social equity measures, governance compliance levels) and bias metrics using standardized schemas. \n\n2. **Model Architecture:** Extend a baseline legal LLM with a multi-head output layer: one head predicts legal reasoning tasks; auxiliary heads predict ESG-related attributes treated as regression and classification subtasks. ESG features are embedded as dense vectors and concatenated with legal representations at intermediate Transformer layers, enabling direct cross-modal interactions. \n\n3. **Loss Function Design:** Define a composite loss \n    \\[ L = L_{legal} + \\lambda_1 L_{ESG} + \\lambda_2 L_{fairness} \\] \nwhere \\(L_{legal}\\) is task-specific legal loss (e.g., cross-entropy for document classification), \\(L_{ESG}\\) is mean squared error or binary cross-entropy on ESG annotations, and \\(L_{fairness}\\) captures demographic parity metrics. Hyperparameters \\(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2\\) balance competing objectives, tuned via grid search to mitigate conflicts between legal precision and ESG compliance. \n\n4. **Explainability Module:** Implement integrated gradients and attention-based attribution maps that quantify ESG feature influence on predictions. This module outputs human-readable explanations linking ESG embedding contributions to model decisions, enabling legal professionals to understand and audit ethical impact. \n\n5. **Federated Fine-Tuning & Privacy:** Employ federated learning across simulated organizational silos maintaining private ESG-labelled legal corpora, preserving data confidentiality whilst sharing updated model parameters compliant with institutional policies.\n\n6. **Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Integration:** Develop RPA scripts that consume model outputs (flagged ESG-legal risks) to automate compliance workflows such as alert generation, documentation updates, or regulatory reporting, thereby embedding the AI system within practical legal operations.\n\nPseudocode and architectural diagrams will accompany the implementation to concretely document the pipeline and justify design assumptions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Aggregate domain-specific datasets: legal documents from Spanish ESG-compliant organizations and Singapore Management University’s sustainability reports; annotate with standardized ESG metrics and bias indicators.\n2. Implement the multi-head Transformer-based LLM with explicit ESG embedding concatenation layers.\n3. Design and validate the composite loss function with different \\(\\lambda\\) weightings to balance legal accuracy and ESG adherence.\n4. Conduct hyperparameter tuning and ablation studies evaluating legal task performance, ESG alignment (using external ESG benchmarks), and fairness metrics.\n5. Integrate explainability tools quantitatively measuring ESG influence on output; validate explanations through expert evaluation with legal practitioners and compliance officers.\n6. Run federated fine-tuning experiments simulating multi-organizational data ownership.\n7. Prototype RPA modules that leverage model outputs for automating ESG-legal compliance workflows; assess impact via pilot studies with corporate legal teams.\n8. Compare results to baseline LLM fine-tuning without ESG integration and to simplified prompt-augmentation ESG embeddings, analysing trade-offs.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Extracted corporate policy document from a Spanish investment fund addressing employee labor rights and environmental emission standards.\nExpected output: (i) Legal AI assessment highlighting compliance with labor law and environmental regulations; (ii) ESG compliance scores quantifying social equity and environmental targets met; (iii) Identification and flagging of clauses potentially violating ethical norms (e.g., inadequate worker protections); (iv) Explainability reports tracing ESG feature influence; (v) Automated RPA-generated compliance alerts and recommended remediation steps.\n\nThis comprehensive output demonstrates the model’s joint legal-ESG interpretability and operational value.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should simultaneous multi-objective optimization prove to degrade core legal task performance, we will adopt a staged fine-tuning approach. First, perform legal domain fine-tuning to ensure baseline accuracy. Subsequently, fine-tune a lightweight ESG-compliance classifier on top of frozen legal embeddings. Alternatively, investigate prompt augmentation strategies embedding ESG context dynamically at inference without altering core model weights, coupled with external RPA-driven ethical compliance filters to maintain practical ESG adherence without compromising legal performance."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section describes an ambitious multi-objective fine-tuning approach combining legal accuracy with ESG compliance metrics, using custom loss functions and explainability modules. However, the mechanism lacks concrete detail on how ESG annotations are quantitatively integrated into both the dataset and loss function design, and how conflicts between legal accuracy and ESG objectives are balanced during training. Clarifying the architecture—e.g., whether ESG is treated as auxiliary tasks or directly embedded features—and specifying how ethical norms are codified and embedded would improve soundness and reproducibility. Detailing explainability approaches that concretely link ESG influence to output is also needed to avoid vague claims and better justify the approach's novelty and validity in this complex setting. This refinement will strengthen the theoretical foundation and help reviewers assess feasibility and impact more confidently. Targeting modeling design choices explicitly will clarify core assumptions and mechanisms, addressing critical soundness concerns in multi-objective ethical AI deployment in legal NLP contexts. The authors are encouraged to incorporate these clarifications before proceeding further with experiments or impact claims, to ensure the proposed framework is conceptually sound and methodologically rigorous.  Suggestions include providing pseudocode, model diagrams, or formal definitions of ESG integration into the loss or model representation space to concretize the fine-tuning pipeline design and its explainability components. This will also help scope the problem clearly and avoid overselling the ESG embedding mechanism that remains high-level now.  \n\n(Section targeted: Proposed_Method)  \n  \n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty screening result of NOV-COMPETITIVE, the idea would benefit from deeper integration with relevant domain-specific contexts to boost impact and distinctiveness. A promising enhancement is to explicitly incorporate insights and datasets from Singapore Management University’s sustainability and corporate social responsibility research, as well as actual ESG compliance and environmental disclosure records from jurisdictions like Spanish companies or investment funds known for ESG reporting. This integration can ground the ESG annotations and legal contexts within real-world compliance frameworks, improving authenticity and applicability. Moreover, leveraging Robotic Process Automation could be proposed as a complementary tool to operationalize the flagged ESG-legal gaps in compliance workflows, increasing practical significance for legal professionals and corporate law practitioners. Aligning with passive funds and return on investment concerns within ethical finance could broaden the impact and industrial relevance of the framework, positioning the work at the intersection of legal AI, sustainable finance, and governance. This will help push the contribution beyond competitive foundational methods towards uniquely actionable innovations interfacing ESG principles in legal fine-tuning pipelines for socially responsible AI systems. The authors should concretely map out these cross-domain linkages and datasets in a revised proposal to amplify novelty and relevance.  \n\n(Section targeted: Motivation and Proposed_Method)"
