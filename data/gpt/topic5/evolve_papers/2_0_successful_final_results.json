    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM-based autonomous customer service agents lack scalable, user-personalized recovery frameworks that can dynamically adapt to evolving adversarial tactics based on real-time user intent feedback. This leads to brittle responses and poor resilience in naturalistic interactions.",
    "Motivation": "This addresses the internal gap of insufficient recovery personalization and lack of user-centric dynamic feedback loops by integrating cognitive science theories on human error correction into adaptive adversarial recovery frameworks, a high-potential innovation opportunity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid system combining a cognitive error model that predicts user frustration and misunderstandings with an adaptive adversarial recovery module. The system continuously captures real-time user interactions and feedback signals (e.g., sentiment shifts, repetition) to tailor recovery strategies by updating intent hypotheses dynamically. The architecture leverages a dual-loop feedback design: a fast loop for immediate correction and a slow loop for policy adjustments, inspired by human cognitive error correction.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data collection of adversarial user interactions with customer agents, annotated for intent shifts and frustration.\n2) Implementation of a cognitive error predictor module trained on such data.\n3) Integration with an LLM-based autonomous agent enhanced by an adaptive recovery layer.\n4) Baselines include standard adversarial training and static recovery.\n5) Evaluation metrics: robustness to adversarial attacks, recovery success rate, user satisfaction via simulated feedback.\n6) Ablations to isolate cognitive module effects.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: User repeatedly asks \"Why is my bill so high?\" with increasing frustration.\nExpected output: The agent recognizes rising frustration, adapts intent hypotheses, and invokes customized recovery, e.g., offers detailed billing explanation and escalates if dissatisfaction persists.",

        "title": "Graph-Enhanced Cognitive Adaptive Intent Recovery for Robust LLM Agents",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM-based autonomous customer service agents lack scalable, user-personalized recovery frameworks that dynamically and robustly adapt to evolving adversarial tactics by integrating real-time multi-turn user intent feedback. Existing methods primarily leverage sequential feedback and static recovery strategies, resulting in brittle responses and poor resilience during naturalistic, adversarial interactions owing to insufficient structural modeling of complex intent relationships and contextual dynamics.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the NOV-COMPETITIVE verdict, this work introduces a novel fusion of cognitive error prediction with graph neural networks (GNNs) for explicit user intention modeling, transcending traditional sequence-based feedback loops. By integrating cognitive science principles of human error correction with advanced GNN architectures that capture complex relational dependencies among multi-turn user intents, historical interactions, and contextual states, our approach represents a significant methodological advancement. This enables richer, personalized, and globally coherent recovery adaptations that overcome brittle LLM responses under adversarial conditions, thus raising both the robustness and interpretability of autonomous agents in competitive intelligent system research landscapes.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid, dual-layer adaptive recovery architecture combining (1) a formalized cognitive error predictor and (2) a user intention GNN module to dynamically update and refine agent intent hypotheses in real-time.\n\n1. Cognitive Error Predictor: Leveraging probabilistic models inspired by human cognitive error correction, we define a Bayesian error prediction mechanism that quantitatively integrates multimodal user feedback signals (sentiment shifts, question repetition frequency, hesitation cues) as observed variables. This predictor estimates the posterior probability of user frustration or misunderstanding states, which informs the urgency and type of recovery actions.\n\n2. User Intention GNN Module: We represent user intents, dialogue acts, and context entities as nodes, encoding sequential and relational interactions as edges. A graph neural network (e.g., gated graph transformer) learns embeddings capturing multi-turn dependencies and latent intent relations beyond linear sequences. This GNN outputs updated intent hypotheses with relational context.\n\n3. Dual-Loop Feedback Design:\n  - Fast Loop: Immediately integrates Bayesian cognitive predictor outputs with the latest GNN-updated intent states to trigger rapid recovery actions (e.g., clarification, escalation).\n  - Slow Loop: Aggregates interaction histories and feedback over extended sessions to adapt the recovery policy via reinforcement learning, optimizing long-term satisfaction and robustness.\n\n4. Integration with LLM Agent: The LLM's intent representation and response generation conditioning are updated dynamically by fusing GNN intent embeddings and cognitive predictor probabilities via attention mechanisms. This tight coupling enables interpretable and adaptable conversational recovery.\n\nOur method's algorithmic specifics include:\n- Formal Bayesian updates for cognitive error state estimation:\n  P(Error_t | Feedback_t) ∝ P(Feedback_t | Error_t) * P(Error_{t-1})\n- Message passing layers in the GNN for multi-turn relational reasoning:\n  h_v^{(l+1)} = σ(Σ_{u ∈ N(v)} W^{(l)} h_u^{(l)} + b^{(l)})\n- Attention fusion for intent embedding integration:\n  Intent_embedding = softmax(QK^T / sqrt(d)) V, where Q derives from LLM state, K,V from GNN outputs.\n\nThis framework explicitly ensures operational clarity, interpretability, and rigor needed for confidence in adversarial resilience.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect and annotate datasets of adversarial multi-turn user interactions with customer agents, enriched by sentiment labels, question repetition, and explicit frustration markers.\n2) Implement and validate the Bayesian cognitive error predictor module to quantitatively infer user error states from feedback signals.\n3) Construct user intention graphs from interaction sequences and train the graph neural network to model complex intent relations.\n4) Integrate the cognitive predictor and GNN modules within the LLM-based autonomous agent to enable dual-loop adaptive recovery.\n5) Establish baselines including static recovery, purely cognitive error prediction, and sequence-based intent models.\n6) Employ evaluation metrics covering robustness under adversarial perturbations, recovery success rate, user satisfaction simulated via feedback proxies, and explainability measures for intent hypothesis updates.\n7) Conduct ablation studies isolating cognitive and GNN contributions.\n8) Test reinforcement learning for slow loop policy updates, evaluating long-term adaptation efficacy.\n",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A user repeatedly asks “Why is my bill so high?” with increasingly negative sentiment and frequent rephrasing over multiple dialogue turns.\nExpected Output: \n- Cognitive predictor identifies rising frustration probability through quantified sentiment drops and repetition frequency.\n- GNN models multi-turn linked user intents, revealing possible misinterpretation or evolving concerns.\n- Fast loop triggers customized recovery: agent offers a detailed, context-aware billing explanation and proposes escalation pathways.\n- Slow loop refines recovery policy over sessions, improving personalization.\n- The system logs interpretable intent hypothesis graphs and cognitive error probabilities to justify agent responses.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If formal Bayesian cognitive error prediction or GNN intention modeling underperform, fallback strategies include heuristic sentiment and repetition threshold-based triggers for immediate recovery actions. Additionally, alternative machine learning models such as variational autoencoders can be explored for latent intent representation. Reinforcement learning for adaptive policy refinement remains a flexible secondary approach to compensate for initial model limitations while preserving adaptive capabilities."

Clarify algorithmic specifics or model architectures underpinning the cognitive error predictor and how it interacts with the LLM agent’s intent representation. This is critical to assess theoretical soundness and reproducibility. Consider formalizing the cognitive error model’s predictive mechanism and precisely defining the feedback update rules for the fast and slow loops to ensure the method's operational clarity and robustness evaluation approach are rigorous and interpretable; target explainability alongside adaptation accuracy to strengthen trustworthiness in adversarial contexts. The current vague framing risks implementation ambiguity and weakens confidence in the mechanism’s internal validity under varied adversarial behaviors and user states, which the submission aims to address as a core contribution."

This could provide a richer structural representation for adaptive recovery policy adjustments, potentially improving intent hypothesis updating and supporting multi-turn intent disambiguation under adversarial user behavior. Leveraging GNNs aligns with globally linked concepts and may significantly enhance both robustness and personalization, thereby increasing the work’s novelty and impact among intelligent system research efforts. This integration could also facilitate knowledge transfer across related domains such as multimodal or networked user interaction data, broadening potential application scenarios and addressing the [NOV-COMPETITIVE] assessment."
