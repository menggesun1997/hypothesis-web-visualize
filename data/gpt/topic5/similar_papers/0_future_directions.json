        "title": "Context-Aware LLM Advisory Systems Anchored in Real-Time Home Care Metrics",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) used in financial advisory systems for elderly or home-based clients often hallucinate or generate misinformation because they lack integration of real-world, context-sensitive data such as social engagement, health status, and home service utilization. This leads to unreliable advice that can negatively impact vulnerable populations.",
        "Motivation": "This idea targets the external/novel gap highlighted by the research landscape map: integrating real-time contextual care system data (social engagement metrics and home-based service utilization) into LLM outputs to reduce hallucinations. Most prevailing LLM advisory systems operate in silos without dynamic embedding of such factors, limiting the trustworthiness of outputs in decentralized advisory contexts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an integrative AI framework that ingests multimodal streaming data from IoT devices used in home care (activity monitors, social interaction logs, financial transaction records) along with LLM textual processing. The system employs context embedding layers linking behavioral and health metrics to financial parameters, grounding the LLM’s language generation in real-time client-specific data. A dynamic feedback loop updates embeddings and calibrates output explanations, promoting transparency and user-tailored recommendations. The advisory interface includes visual pointers to context data influencing each recommendation to enhance user trust and understanding.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multimodal datasets combining anonymized financial transaction records, home activity logs, and social engagement indicators from consenting elderly home care participants.\n2. Fine-tune open-source LLMs such as GPT-4 or LLaMA with a multi-input embedding layer architecture to incorporate these real-time metrics.\n3. Benchmark against baseline LLM advisory systems lacking contextual embeddings using metrics for hallucination rate, factuality, and user trust (via surveys).\n4. Evaluate explainability by human expert panels assessing if recommendations transparently link to relevant context.\n5. Perform ablation studies removing context components to measure impact.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Sample input: \"John, 78, with moderate mobility issues, recently increased social isolation, and irregular bill payments, asks: 'Should I consolidate my retirement savings to reduce monthly expenses?'\"\nExpected output: \"Given your recent changes in mobility and decreased social engagement, consolidating retirement savings might help reduce monthly fees and simplify management. However, ensure liquidity for unexpected health expenses. Consider consulting your care coordinator for personalized cash flow planning.\"\nHighlight links recommendations to John's health and social data.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time data integration proves technically challenging, fallback to semi-annual context embedding updates via caregiver-reported metrics and use simulated datasets for model training. If LLM grounding still has hallucinations, integrate symbolic verification modules or rule-based filters to cross-check domain-specific financial advisories against embedded context."

        "title": "Co-Designed Continuous-Learning Advisory Systems for Financial Decisions in Elder Care Homes",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing financial advisory LLM systems do not adequately incorporate stakeholder feedback or continuous learning within real-world care home environments. This limits their ability to detect and correct misinformation dynamically, reducing decision relevance and adaptability to evolving contexts.",
        "Motivation": "This addresses an internal gap regarding difficulty in co-designing tools fitting complex care home settings and educates professionals to interpret AI outputs critically. Moreover, it exploits the hidden bridge between care home organizational themes and optimal treatment paradigms via program theory frameworks, enabling AI systems that evolve responsively with user feedback loops to mitigate hallucinations.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design and implement an interactive AI advisory tool using a program theory approach to model context-mechanism-outcome relationships specific to financial advisory in elder care homes. The system incorporates structured stakeholder input (residents, caregivers, financial advisors) via in-app dialogue prompts to capture corrective feedback. It employs reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and dynamic model updates so the LLM continuously improves its output quality and reduces misinformation. The design process involves participatory workshops ensuring alignment with user needs and critical interpretation skills development.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collaborate with multiple elder care homes to co-design the advisory tool interface and feedback mechanisms.\n2. Deploy a baseline LLM financial advisor with initial training on relevant datasets.\n3. Collect iterative feedback from stakeholders through simulated advisory sessions over several months.\n4. Apply RLHF techniques to adapt the LLM continuously.\n5. Evaluate misinformation reduction by expert auditing of output before and after continuous learning.\n6. Measure user trust, interpretation skills, and system usability through longitudinal surveys and focus groups.\n7. Compare with static LLM advisory deployed in similar settings.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Resident asks, \"Is now a good time to invest in bond funds given my fixed income?\"\nInitial output might overemphasize risk ignoring resident’s liquidity constraints.\nStakeholder corrects: \"Suggest safer, liquid options due to health unpredictability.\"\nSystem updates advice in subsequent sessions to: \"Considering your fixed income and potential health expenses, low-risk, high-liquidity options like Treasury bills may be more appropriate than bond funds.\"\nShows improved alignment with context after feedback.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real stakeholder feedback collection is constrained, conduct extensive simulated user interactions with synthetic personas to train and test continuous learning. Alternatively, embed supervised correction datasets to bootstrap the RLHF loop. If RLHF convergence is slow, explore hybrid models combining rule-based constraints with learning-based generation."

        "title": "Multimodal Verification Network Fusing Vision Transformers and Knowledge Graphs for Fact-Checked Financial Advice",
        "Problem_Statement": "Financial advisory LLMs often produce outputs with low citation accuracy and unverifiable assertions, especially impactful for elderly or vulnerable populations relying on such guidance, potentially causing harmful financial decisions.",
        "Motivation": "This idea directly targets the internal gap of low citation accuracy and unverified outputs by importing advances from oncology AI diagnostics (multimodal precision diagnostics using vision transformers and knowledge graphs) into financial advisory LLMs. This cross-disciplinary knowledge fusion proposes a novel architecture ensuring that generated advice aligns with validated external evidence bases, enhancing trustworthiness substantially.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a multimodal verification network that integrates a vision transformer module analyzing scanned or digital financial documents (statements, reports) and domain-specific knowledge graphs encoding financial regulations, product details, and client profiles. The LLM integrates this verification layer by querying the knowledge graph and document embeddings to validate its textual output before client presentation. A fact-checking scoring system flags unverified or hallucinated claims in real time. Outputs include pointer-based citations to source documents or knowledge nodes, reinforcing transparency.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Build a comprehensive financial knowledge graph capturing regulatory rules, investment products, and client risk profiles.\n2. Collect multimodal datasets including anonymized financial documents (PDFs, spreadsheets) paired with advisory dialogues.\n3. Train a vision transformer to encode document visuals semantically.\n4. Integrate with LLM text generator and knowledge graph query module via cross-modal attention mechanisms.\n5. Benchmark against standard LLM advisors on metrics for factual accuracy, citation precision, and hallucination reduction.\n6. Perform user studies assessing trust and reliance on fact-checked advice among elderly cohorts.\n7. Analyze system performance degradation cases to improve verification modules.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Should Mary invest in Fund X, considering her recent investment portfolio and the fund’s risk level?\"\nSystem parses Mary’s digital portfolio documents and queries knowledge graph for Fund X’s regulatory filings and historical performance.\nOutput: \"Given your portfolio diversification and Fund X's moderate risk profile (per SEC filings dated 2023-05), an allocation of up to 15% may be suitable, balancing growth and risk.\"\nIncludes citations linking advice to specific regulatory documents and portfolio snapshots.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If vision transformer fails to accurately encode financial documents, fallback on text extraction OCR preprocessing pipelines with error correction. If knowledge graph is incomplete, incorporate external trusted APIs or databases dynamically. If integration latency is too high, apply asynchronous verification with advisory disclaimers pending final validation."
