    "title": "Multimodal Federated Learning Architecture for Cross-Institutional Legal Analysis",
    "Problem_Statement": "Legal data is highly sensitive and distributed across diverse institutions, with variations in modalities (text, scanned images) and formats, impeding centralized model training.",
    "Motivation": "This idea tackles the external gap of absent federated learning and multimodal approaches in legal LLMs, addressing privacy and domain-shift challenges simultaneously. It synthesizes advances in federated learning with multimodal foundation models, creating a privacy-preserving platform for robust cross-institutional legal analysis.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a federated learning system integrating a multimodal foundation model capable of processing both textual and document image data. Implement domain adaptation layers personalized per institution to handle domain shifts, and privacy-preserving protocols (e.g., differential privacy, secure aggregation). Employ an ontology-informed consistency loss ensuring semantic alignment of outputs across participants.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Partner with multiple law firms or legal institutions to collect distributed anonymized data covering text and scanned legal documents. 2. Initialize a multimodal Transformer-based foundation model pretrained on general text and document images. 3. Deploy federated fine-tuning cycles with domain-adaptive personalization layers. 4. Evaluate federated vs centralized models on cross-institutional legal tasks like information retrieval and clause extraction. 5. Metrics: privacy leakage measures, task accuracy, domain generalization scores, communication efficiency.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A scanned contract image containing clauses about liability limits. Output: Extracted and semantically classified clauses compliant with each participating institution's document style, demonstrating robust multimodal understanding under privacy constraints.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated learning training is unstable, explore hybrid approaches using secure multi-party computation for model updates or switch to domain adaptation on synthetically federated data. Investigate modality-specific encoders if joint multimodal fusion is problematic."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed federated learning framework integrating multimodal foundation models is compelling but lacks clarity on the integration mechanism between textual and image modalities under federated constraints. Details on how modality fusion occurs locally, and how domain adaptation layers are personalized and updated across heterogeneous clients need elaboration to ensure the method's soundness and practical implementability. Additionally, operationalizing the ontology-informed consistency loss across decentralized participants poses technical challenges that should be explicitly addressed in the method section to strengthen its reasoning and reproducibility potential. Providing architectural diagrams or algorithmic pseudocode would significantly improve the reader's understanding and confidence in the approach's coherence and novelty within the competitive landscape described in the novelty pre-screening stage. Targeting these mechanism-level specifics is crucial for the robustness and credibility of this federated multimodal legal analysis architecture. Target Section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "The experimental plan is ambitious in its partnership with multiple legal institutions and the collection of multimodal data but omits discussion of practical challenges and mitigation strategies around data heterogeneity, privacy compliance (e.g., legal and regulatory issues), and the complexity of coordinating federated learning cycles in real-world legal environments. There is also no clear explanation of how communication efficiency will be ensured or measured given the potentially large multimodal model sizes and decentralized data distribution. Furthermore, fallback plans suggest alternatives but lack concrete criteria for triggering these contingencies or plans for their evaluation. Strengthening the experiment section by outlining clear governance protocols, data preprocessing pipelines, client selection criteria, and staged validation milestones would improve feasibility and increase confidence that the research can be successfully executed at scale in this sensitive domain. Concrete resource estimates (e.g., computational, data annotation effort) and risk assessments would also be beneficial here. Target Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
