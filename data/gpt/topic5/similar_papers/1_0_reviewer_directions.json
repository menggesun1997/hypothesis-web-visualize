    "title": "Cyber-Infused Federated Anomaly Detection for Bias Mitigation in AI-CDSS",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current AI clinical decision support systems (AI-CDSS) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and suffer from bias due to data heterogeneity and unrevealed anomalies, impeding safe deployment in healthcare.",
    "Motivation": "This idea uses the critical gap identifying overlooked cybersecurity anomaly detection methods as a bridge for bias mitigation in federated frameworks, directly addressing bias, adversarial robustness, and data privacy issues in decentralized healthcare AI.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a federated learning system embedding lightweight intrusion detection system (IDS)-inspired anomaly detectors within local clients' models. These detectors use cybersecurity concepts like behavior pattern baselining and statistical anomaly scoring on intermediate representations of medical image and text data. The system collaboratively identifies and suppresses biased, malicious, or anomalous data contributions in real-time. Models incorporate dynamic fairness-aware reweighting and secure aggregation to maintain privacy without losing interpretability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Use publicly available federated datasets, e.g., federated MIMIC-III text and decentralized chest X-ray images. 2) Implement baseline federated LLM and CNN models without anomaly detection. 3) Integrate IDS-inspired anomaly detection modules and dynamic fairness reweighting. 4) Evaluate bias metrics (e.g., demographic parity), adversarial robustness tests, and privacy leakage (membership inference). 5) Compare interpretability using explainability methods such as SHAP. 6) Conduct ablation studies on anomaly detection components.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multi-site radiology images with synthetic bias towards certain ethnic groups and injected adversarial perturbations. Output: The model flags anomalous data sources in federated rounds, reduces bias in diagnosis predictions across demographics, and resists adversarial attacks, improving fairness and robustness with maintained privacy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If IDS-based anomaly detection proves too noisy or computationally heavy, fallback to simpler statistical outlier detection techniques or use trusted execution environments to enhance security. Alternatively, shift focus to post hoc bias correction using explainability feedback."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section describes embedding IDS-inspired anomaly detectors within local clients' models to detect bias, malicious, or anomalous data contributions. However, the mechanism lacks clarity on how behavior pattern baselining and statistical anomaly scoring interact with intermediate medical image and text representations, which can be highly heterogeneous and multimodal. Additionally, it is unclear how these cybersecurity techniques transfer from traditional IDS contexts to federated medical AI scenarios without compromising model performance or interpretability. The interplay between anomaly detection, dynamic fairness-aware reweighting, and secure aggregation needs more precise operational details and theoretical justification to establish soundness and ensure practical utility in clinical decision support systems. I recommend providing detailed algorithmic steps or pseudo-code and theoretical grounding for these components to clarify how the system maintains fairness, robustness, and interpretability concurrently without contradiction or excessive overheads, especially given the sensitive medical domain and privacy constraints. This will substantiate the core technical assumptions and illuminate potential trade-offs or failure modes inherent in the approach, which is critical for soundness validation and trustworthiness of the proposed framework in healthcare AI deployments.\n\nTarget: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "While the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is structured logically and targets appropriate datasets (federated MIMIC-III and chest X-ray images), the plan could face challenges in feasibility primarily due to complexity and evaluation scope. Federated learning with integrated IDS-based anomaly detection may be computationally expensive and require extensive infrastructure setup, possibly beyond typical academic resource availability. The plan proposes a comprehensive set of bias, adversarial robustness, privacy leakage, and interpretability evaluations, combined with ablation studies, which might be overly ambitious for an initial implementation. To improve feasibility, I suggest prioritizing evaluation tasks in phased experiments—starting with anomaly detection effectiveness and bias mitigation separately before combining them. Also, specify computational resources, federated setup parameters (e.g., communication rounds, client heterogeneity), and potential simulation of adversarial attacks and privacy attacks in realistic conditions. Clarify how synthetic biases and adversarial perturbations will be crafted and controlled to ensure reproducibility. Addressing these points will lead to a more scientifically sound and practically executable experimental plan, reducing risks of inconclusive results or undue delays in validating the novel methodology.\n\nTarget: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
