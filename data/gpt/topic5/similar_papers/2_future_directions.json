        "title": "Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Resilience Framework for Autonomous Agents",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current reinforcement learning frameworks for autonomous customer service agents lack integration with symbolic reasoning and fail to provide resilience against sophisticated adversarial inputs, limiting robustness and recovery.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of insufficient interplay between learning algorithms and security controls by integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning, responding to the external gap of missing interdisciplinary approaches like neuro-symbolic AI to improve explainability and fault tolerance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid architecture combining reinforcement learning for decision making with symbolic knowledge bases representing security policies and failure diagnostics. The system continuously updates symbolic rules based on agent experience and adversarial feedback. Symbolic reasoning modules identify failure patterns and enforce adaptive recovery strategies, while the RL component optimizes policy under adversarial conditions. This synergy enables interpretable failure detection, dynamic policy adjustment and verifiable recovery mechanisms.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Gather customer service dialogue datasets with adversarial perturbations. 2) Implement baseline RL agents (e.g., PPO) for autonomous response. 3) Construct a symbolic knowledge base of security and recovery rules. 4) Integrate neuro-symbolic module with RL agent. 5) Evaluate robustness under adversarial attacks vs. baseline using metrics like accuracy, recovery latency and interpretability scores. 6) Conduct ablation on symbolic knowledge adaptation and RL interaction. 7) Deploy on simulated real-world service scenarios for practical validation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Customer query with adversarial phrasing intending to confuse authentication (\"My account ID is 1234; can you reset?\" with subtle typo). Expected Output: System detects anomaly via symbolic inconsistency check, triggers recovery authentication using adaptive questioning, and successfully authenticates or denies request with explanation logs.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If integration complexity hinders training, decouple modules for sequential processing and retrain. If symbolic rule generation is insufficient, employ expert feedback loops or semi-automated ontological expansion. Alternatively, explore explanation-based RL to approximate interpretability without full symbolic reasoning."

        "title": "Explainable Reinforcement Learning Agents for Dynamic Security Policy Adaptation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Reinforcement learning agents lack transparent mechanisms to explain decisions under adversarial conditions, which hinders trust and effective recovery in customer service applications.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the internal gap of opaque failure modes and gaps in recovery by fusing explainable AI with reinforcement learning, realizing Opportunity 1's vision to empower autonomous agents with interpretable diagnostics and adaptive security enforcement mechanisms.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design an RL framework augmented with explainability modules that produce human-readable rationales for actions, particularly under adversarial inputs. Incorporate counterfactual explanations to reveal why certain decisions were made or rejected. Use these explanations to drive automated recovery policies and enable human trust calibration. The security policy parameters are dynamically adjusted based on explanation feedback loops.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select dialogue datasets with adversarial and benign inputs. 2) Train RL agents on task completion and adversarial resilience. 3) Develop post-hoc and intrinsic explanation methods (attention visualization, counterfactual generation). 4) Evaluate explanation quality with user studies and automatic metrics. 5) Test adaptive security parameter updating triggered by explanation insights. 6) Benchmark robustness improvements and user trust gains over baselines.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Adversarial request that superficially matches authentication criteria but internally conflicts with prior session context. Expected Output: Agent explains decision ('Request denied because authentication token mismatch with session history') and initiates recovery protocol, improving robustness and user trust.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If explanation models degrade RL performance, separate explanation generation as an offline analyzer. Explore simpler surrogate explanation models or reinforcement learning with uncertainty estimation as fallback for alerting potential failures."

        "title": "Blockchain-enabled Adaptive Authentication with Neuro-Symbolic Verification",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing blockchain-based authentication systems are static and lack integration with adaptive learning agents, limiting their ability to respond effectively to evolving adversarial threats in autonomous customer service agents.",
        "Motivation": "Bridges the internal gap between reinforcement learning adaptability and blockchain access control by applying neuro-symbolic reasoning to dynamically update security policies on-chain, supporting verifiable and evolving authentication mechanisms, concretizing Opportunity 2.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a blockchain framework where security policies are stored as symbolic rules. RL agents interact with the blockchain to propose adaptive policy updates based on detected adversarial patterns. Neuro-symbolic modules verify policy consistency and correctness before committing updates, ensuring verifiability and adaptability. Smart contracts enforce updated authentication flows dynamically linked to agent experience.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement simulated blockchain environment with smart contracts for authentication policies. 2) Prepare adversarial customer service dialogue data. 3) Deploy RL agent to learn to defend via policy updates. 4) Create neuro-symbolic verifier to validate policy changes. 5) Evaluate security robustness, policy update correctness, and system overhead against static blockchain authentication.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Repeated adversarial authentication attempts using novel attack vectors. Expected Output: Agent detects new attack pattern, proposes updated policy, neuro-symbolic verifier approves, blockchain updates smart contract, rejecting attacks in future attempts with audit trail.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain performance bottlenecks emerge, offload some verification tasks off-chain with commit proofs. If symbolic verification is insufficiently scalable, utilize approximate or probabilistic policy validation with human expert oversight."

        "title": "Human-Centric Trust Modeling for Behavioral Authentication in Autonomous Agents",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current AI-driven authentication mechanisms ignore dynamic human behavioral trust factors, resulting in vulnerabilities against unauthorized access in customer service scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the external gap of missing socio-technical security considerations by integrating behavioral cybersecurity and trust dynamics into autonomous authentication design, fulfilling Opportunity 3's potential for holistic risk mitigation beyond purely technical defenses.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a trust-aware authentication framework that models user behavior patterns, interaction histories, and contextual cues using behavioral cybersecurity principles. Embed this trust model into the agent's decision pipeline, adjusting authentication requirements adaptively. Incorporate feedback loops from human trust signals to refine authentication stringency, balancing user convenience and security dynamically.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect data on user-agent interactions, including behavioral biometrics and contextual factors. 2) Build baselines with standard authentication methods. 3) Design and implement trust modeling algorithms integrating behavioral features. 4) Integrate trust model into authentication decision logic. 5) Evaluate unauthorized access rates, false positives/negatives, user satisfaction, and trust metrics. 6) Perform live user studies to validate real-world efficacy.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A returning user's voice pattern and typing cadence slightly deviating due to illness. Expected Output: Trust model recognizes legitimate behavioral variance, maintains authentication with adjusted thresholds, ensuring smooth user experience without compromising security.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If behavioral data is insufficient or noisy, combine with multi-factor authentication fallback. Employ incremental learning to improve trust modeling over time. If trust adaptation reduces security, introduce conservative policy thresholds and human-in-the-loop verification."

The system extracts interpretable features from agent behaviors, identifies failure modes, and prescribes corrective actions modeled on engineering resilience frameworks. Failure diagnostics incorporate causality analysis and scenario simulation to enhance recovery planning.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Simulate adversarial attacks and failure conditions in customer service agents. 2) Train explainable models (e.g., decision trees, causal models) to classify failure types. 3) Embed resilience metrics and corrective policies based on engineering principles. 4) Evaluate diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and recovery success against black box methods. 5) Conduct stress tests and sensitivity analysis for robustness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An agent repeatedly failing to authenticate after network latency spikes. Expected Output: Diagnostic system identifies failure cause as communication delay, recommends retry and timeout parameter adaptation, improving resilience.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If explainable models lack predictive power, hybridize with black box anomaly detectors. Scale up labeled failure data via synthetic generation or expert annotation. If resilience policies disrupt agent performance, fine-tune recovery thresholds adaptively."
