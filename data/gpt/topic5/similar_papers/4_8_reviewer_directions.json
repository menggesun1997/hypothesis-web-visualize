    "title": "Ontology-Driven Multimodal Prompt Engineering for Legal LLM Fine-Tuning",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current multimodal fine-tuning approaches for legal LLMs lack integration with domain ontologies leading to suboptimal semantic grounding and interpretability in complex legal documents.",
    "Motivation": "By bridging ontology-driven NLP tools with state-of-the-art multimodal fine-tuning techniques, this research fills the critical gap of siloed domains, advancing semantic richness and explainability in legal multimodal LLMs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop ontology-aware prompt engineering methods where multimodal inputs (text plus document images) are processed through ontology-guided embedding layers. These embeddings influence prompt templates that dynamically adjust to semantic context during fine-tuning. The approach incorporates explainability layers mapping outputs back to ontology concepts supporting transparent reasoning.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Compile a dataset of multimodal legal documents annotated with ontology concept mappings. 2. Preprocess data into multimodal embeddings augmented by ontology features. 3. Construct adaptive prompts integrating these embeddings for fine-tuning a legal LLM. 4. Evaluate on legal document classification, summarization, and retrieval tasks. 5. Baselines: multimodal fine-tuning without ontology guidance. Metrics include performance, semantic alignment, and explainability scores.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A scanned legal contract image plus associated textual metadata. Output: A legally accurate classification with explainable attribution to contract clauses and ontology concepts.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If ontology embedding integration reduces model generalization, use ontology features as auxiliary tasks or post-hoc explanation tools rather than direct prompt components."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section lacks clarity on how ontology-guided embedding layers will be integrated technically within the prompt engineering pipeline. Specifically, it's unclear how ontology concepts will dynamically influence or modify prompt templates during fine-tuning and how the explainability layers concretely map model outputs back to ontology concepts for transparent reasoning. Providing a precise architectural design or algorithmic outline is crucial to validate soundness and reproducibility of the approach, especially given the complexity of multimodal inputs and legal domain specificity. This will help establish a well-reasoned mechanism rather than a high-level concept and address key feasibility concerns related to model training and interpretability pipelines in legal contexts. Please elaborate details on data flow, embedding fusion methods, prompt adaptation mechanisms, and the explainability integration framework within the model stack in the Proposed_Method section. This is the foundation for judging technical soundness and operational feasibility of your approach given the problem stated."

          "feedback_content": "Given the high competition and existing links between ontology-guided NLP and multimodal fine-tuning, consider integrating 'knowledge graph' concepts explicitly to elevate both novelty and impact. For example, build or leverage a legal domain knowledge graph that structurally represents ontology concepts and their interrelations, and use graph embeddings as a richer, structured signal for prompt conditioning. This could enable more powerful semantic reasoning, facilitate advanced explainability by tracing inference paths on the graph, and potentially improve generalization by aligning model outputs with graph-based commonsense legal knowledge. Connecting to broader 'knowledge representation' and 'commonsense reasoning' paradigms through knowledge graphs may open innovative downstream tasks (e.g., complex legal question answering) and increase your work's relevance to the wider AI community while addressing semantic alignment challenges noted in the proposal."
