    "abstract": "Large-scale Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) models, including Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT/GPT-4, have achieved unprecedented success in a variety of general domain tasks. Yet, when applied directly to specialized domains like medical imaging, which require in-depth expertise, these models face notable challenges arising from the medical field's inherent complexities and unique characteristics. In this review, we delve into the potential applications of AGI models in medical imaging and healthcare, with a primary focus on LLMs, Large Vision Models, and Large Multimodal Models. We provide a thorough overview of the key features and enabling techniques of LLMs and AGI, and further examine the roadmaps guiding the evolution and implementation of AGI models in the medical sector, summarizing their present applications, potentialities, and associated challenges. In addition, we highlight potential future research directions, offering a holistic view on upcoming ventures. This comprehensive review aims to offer insights into the future implications of AGI in medical imaging, healthcare, and beyond.",

    "year": 2024,
    "citationCount": 10,

    "abstract": "PurposeRare diseases pose significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to their low prevalence and heterogeneous clinical presentations. Unstructured clinical notes contain valuable information for identifying rare diseases, but manual curation is time-consuming and prone to subjectivity. This study aims to develop a hybrid approach combining dictionary-based natural language processing (NLP) tools with large language models (LLMs) to improve rare disease identification from unstructured clinical reports.MethodsWe propose a novel hybrid framework that integrates the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO) and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to create a comprehensive rare disease vocabulary. SemEHR, a dictionary-based NLP tool, is employed to extract rare disease mentions from clinical notes. To refine the results and improve accuracy, we leverage various LLMs, including LLaMA3, Phi3-mini, and domain-specific models like OpenBioLLM and BioMistral. Different prompting strategies, such as zero-shot, few-shot, and knowledge-augmented generation, are explored to optimize the LLMs’ performance.ResultsThe proposed hybrid approach demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional NLP systems and standalone LLMs. LLaMA3 and Phi3-mini achieve the highest F1 scores in rare disease identification. Few-shot prompting with 1-3 examples yields the best results, while knowledge-augmented generation shows limited improvement. Notably, the approach uncovers a significant number of potential rare disease cases not documented in structured diagnostic records, highlighting its ability to identify previously unrecognized patients.ConclusionThe hybrid approach combining dictionary-based NLP tools with LLMs shows great promise for improving rare disease identification from unstructured clinical reports. By leveraging the strengths of both techniques, the method demonstrates superior performance and the potential to uncover hidden rare disease cases. Further research is needed to address limitations related to ontology mapping and overlapping case identification, and to integrate the approach into clinical practice for early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This survey explores the transformative impact of foundation models (FMs) in artificial intelligence, focusing on their integration with federated learning (FL) in biomedical research. Foundation models such as ChatGPT, LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and multimodal patient interactions. The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges, and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs and FL, laying the groundwork for healthcare innovations.",

    "abstract": "After ChatGPT was released, large language models (LLMs) became more popular. Academicians use ChatGPT or LLM models for different purposes, and the use of ChatGPT or LLM is increasing from medical science to diversified areas. Recently, the multimodal LLM (MLLM) has also become popular. Therefore, we comprehensively illustrate the LLM and MLLM models for a complete understanding. We also aim for simple and extended reviews of LLMs and MLLMs for a broad category of readers, such as researchers, students in diversified fields, and other academicians. The review article illustrates the LLM and MLLM models, their working principles, and their applications in diversified fields. First, we demonstrate the technical concept of LLMs, working principle, Black Box, and the evolution of LLMs. To explain the working principle, we discuss the tokenization process, token representation, and token relationships. We also extensively demonstrate the application of LLMs in biological macromolecules, medical science, biological science, and other areas. We illustrate the multimodal applications of LLMs or MLLMs. Finally, we illustrate the limitations, challenges, and future prospects of LLMs. The review acts as a booster dose for clinicians, a primer for molecular biologists, and a catalyst for scientists, and also benefits diversified academicians.",

We present a comprehensive literature review that examines the latest research on authorship attribution in the era of LLMs. This survey systematically explores the landscape of this field by categorizing four representative problems: (1) Human-written Text Attribution; (2) LLM-generated Text Detection; (3) LLM-generated Text Attribution; and (4) Human-LLM Co-authored Text Attribution. We also discuss the challenges related to ensuring the generalization and explainability of authorship attribution methods. Generalization requires the ability to generalize across various domains, while explainability emphasizes providing transparent and understandable insights into the decisions made by these models. By evaluating the strengths and limitations of existing methods and benchmarks, we identify key open problems and future research directions in this field. This literature review serves a roadmap for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the state of the art in this rapidly evolving field. Additional resources and a curated list of papers are available and regularly updated at https://llm-authorship.github.io/.",

    "abstract": "ChatGPT has drawn considerable attention from both the general public and domain experts with its remarkable text generation capabilities. This has subsequently led to the emergence of diverse applications in the field of biomedicine and health. In this work, we examine the diverse applications of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, in biomedicine and health. Specifically, we explore the areas of biomedical information retrieval, question answering, medical text summarization, information extraction and medical education and investigate whether LLMs possess the transformative power to revolutionize these tasks or whether the distinct complexities of biomedical domain presents unique challenges. Following an extensive literature survey, we find that significant advances have been made in the field of text generation tasks, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art methods. For other applications, the advances have been modest. Overall, LLMs have not yet revolutionized biomedicine, but recent rapid progress indicates that such methods hold great potential to provide valuable means for accelerating discovery and improving health. We also find that the use of LLMs, like ChatGPT, in the fields of biomedicine and health entails various risks and challenges, including fabricated information in its generated responses, as well as legal and privacy concerns associated with sensitive patient data. We believe this survey can provide a comprehensive and timely overview to biomedical researchers and healthcare practitioners on the opportunities and challenges associated with using ChatGPT and other LLMs for transforming biomedicine and health.",

    "abstract": "Identifying valuable information within the extensive texts documented in natural language presents a significant challenge in various disciplines. Named Entity Recognition (NER), as one of the critical technologies in text data processing and mining, has become a current research hotspot. To accurately and objectively review the progress in NER, this paper employs bibliometric methods. It analyzes 1300 documents related to NER obtained from the Web of Science database using CiteSpace software. Firstly, statistical analysis is performed on the literature and journals that were obtained to explore the distribution characteristics of the literature. Secondly, the core authors in the field of NER, the development of the technology in different countries, and the leading institutions are explored by analyzing the number of publications and the cooperation network graph. Finally, explore the research frontiers, development tracks, research hotspots, and other information in this field from a scientific point of view, and further discuss the five research frontiers and seven research hotspots in depth. This paper explores the progress of NER research from both macro and micro perspectives. It aims to assist researchers in quickly grasping relevant information and offers constructive ideas and suggestions to promote the development of NER.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent decision-making (IDM) is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to automate or augment decision processes. Modern IDM paradigms integrate advanced frameworks to enable intelligent agents to make effective and adaptive choices and decompose complex tasks into manageable steps, such as AI agents and high-level reinforcement learning. Recent advances in multimodal foundation-based approaches unify diverse input modalities-such as vision, language, and sensory data-into a cohesive decision-making process. Foundation models (FMs) have become pivotal in science and industry, transforming decision-making and research capabilities. Their large-scale, multimodal data-processing abilities foster adaptability and interdisciplinary breakthroughs across fields such as healthcare, life sciences, and education. This survey examines IDM's evolution, advanced paradigms with FMs and their transformative impact on decision-making across diverse scientific and industrial domains, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in building efficient, adaptive, and ethical decision systems.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have been significantly driven by the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), representing a substantial leap in language-based technology capabilities. These models, built on sophisticated deep learning architectures, typically transformers, are characterized by billions of parameters and extensive training data, enabling them to achieve high accuracy across various tasks. The transformer architecture of LLMs allows them to effectively handle context and sequential information, which is crucial for understanding and generating human language. Beyond traditional NLP applications, LLMs have shown significant promise in bioinformatics, transforming the field by addressing challenges associated with large and complex biological datasets. In genomics, proteomics, and personalized medicine, LLMs facilitate identifying patterns, predicting protein structures, or understanding genetic variations. This capability is crucial, e.g., for advancing drug discovery, where accurate prediction of molecular interactions is essential. This review discusses the current trends in LLMs research and their potential to revolutionize the field of bioinformatics and accelerate novel discoveries in the life sciences.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the pandemic caused by COVID-19 is severe in the entire world. The prevention and control of crimes associated with COVID-19 are critical for controlling the pandemic. Therefore, to provide efficient and convenient intelligent legal knowledge services during the pandemic, we develop an intelligent system for legal information retrieval on the WeChat platform in this paper. The data source we used for training our system is “The typical cases of national procuratorial authorities handling crimes against the prevention and control of the new coronary pneumonia pandemic following the law”, which is published online by the Supreme People’s Procuratorate of the People’s Republic of China. We base our system on convolutional neural network and use the semantic matching mechanism to capture inter-sentence relationship information and make a prediction. Moreover, we introduce an auxiliary learning process to help the network better distinguish the relation between two sentences. Finally, the system uses the trained model to identify the information entered by a user and responds to the user with a reference case similar to the query case and gives the reference legal gist applicable to the query case.",
