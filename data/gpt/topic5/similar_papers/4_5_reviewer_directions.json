    "title": "Federated Multi-Task Learning for Multimodal Legal Document Understanding",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing legal LLMs lack support for multimodal inputs and collaborative training paradigms, which limits applicability to privacy-sensitive, cross-institutional multimodal legal datasets.",
    "Motivation": "Capitalizing on the novel external gap of missing multimodal and federated learning solutions in legal analysis, this approach merges federated multi-task learning with multimodal data processing to enable privacy-preserving, jointly trained legal models.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a federated learning platform supporting multi-task objectives across text, scanned images, and metadata features in legal documents. Utilize modality-specific encoders fused via cross-attention mechanisms with shared global parameters updated through secure aggregation. Incorporate task prioritization and dynamic weighting to balance diverse objectives like classification, entity recognition, and summarization across clients.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Simulate cross-institutional legal datasets with multimodal content. 2. Build modality-specific encoders (e.g., CNNs for images, Transformers for text). 3. Configure federated multi-task learning using state-of-the-art protocols. 4. Evaluate on benchmark tasks including contract interpretation and evidence extraction. 5. Metrics: task-specific accuracy, client data privacy, convergence rates.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Textual contract clauses plus undersigned scanned signatures. Output: Multi-task outputs including clause classification and signature verification, collaboratively trained across federated clients.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "Upon federated system instabilities, reduce modality complexity or apply personalized local training with periodic global parameter updates. Test synthetic federated setups prior to full deployment."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The approach assumes that multimodal legal documents across different institutions can be effectively aligned and integrated under federated training without significant domain or modality heterogeneity issues impacting model convergence or performance. This assumption requires further clarification and justification, as legal documents vary widely in format, style, and modality distribution across institutions, which may complicate shared model learning and degrade task performance if not properly addressed. It is recommended to explicitly discuss the handling of cross-client heterogeneity and its impact on the multi-task federated framework to strengthen the methodological soundness and realism of the approach, including any domain adaptation or personalization strategies planned for mitigating this challenge, beyond the fallback plan's mention of modality reduction or local training phases. Without these considerations, the core assumption of effective federated multi-task multimodal learning at scale on legal data remains weakly supported and could cause feasibility issues later in the pipeline, including convergence instability and degraded accuracy for certain clients or modalities. A more detailed discussion, supported by preliminary empirical or theoretical insights, would greatly enhance the conceptual robustness of the proposal's foundational assumptions in Proposed_Method and Problem_Statement sections."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the strong competitiveness and existing prior work linking federated learning, multimodal data, and legal or medical domains, the proposal could significantly enhance its novelty and impact by integrating privacy-enhancing technologies specifically tailored for high-risk sensitive sectors. For instance, incorporating robust de-identification techniques from medical artificial intelligence literature alongside multi-view contrastive learning could both protect client privacy and improve representation learning across modalities in legal data. Furthermore, leveraging state-of-the-art privacy-preserving aggregation protocols similar to those used in clinical decision support systems or within regulatory frameworks like the European Health Data Space might increase trustworthiness and adoption prospects. Therefore, I suggest the Innovator explicitly explores and incorporates advanced privacy-enhancing technologies and cross-domain knowledge from medical AI and clinical data federationâ€”this global integration can fortify the privacy guarantees and address regulatory compliance challenges, while also elevating the scientific contribution beyond a mere consolidation of federated multimodal multi-task learning architectures."
