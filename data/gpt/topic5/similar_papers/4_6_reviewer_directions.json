    "title": "Legal Text Hallucination Mitigation via Biomedical-Inspired Reliability Scoring",
    "Problem_Statement": "Hallucination in legal text generation undermines reliability and trust, specifically because current LLMs adapted for legal tasks lack robust reliability estimators.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by biomedical report generation frameworks, this research proposes a specialized reliability scoring mechanism tailored for legal text generation to detect and reduce hallucinated outputs, improving critical legal NLP tasks' trustworthiness.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a two-stage pipeline embedding a reliability scoring network trained on biomedical text generation datasets but adapted with legal domain data. This scorer quantifies factual consistency and domain appropriateness in generated legal texts. Integrate this score as a penalty during fine-tuning and as a re-ranking criterion during inference to filter hallucinated outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect paired legal input-output datasets with annotations for hallucination. 2. Adapt biomedical reliability scoring models for legal text. 3. Train joint generation and scoring models. 4. Benchmark against baseline LLMs on tasks like contract summarization and legal question answering. 5. Evaluate hallucination rate, factual accuracy, and human expert trust ratings.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Generate a summary of the legal liabilities in this case.\" Output: A summary with a high reliability score, minimal invented facts, and references to documented cases.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If transfer from biomedical scoring models is ineffective, fine-tune scoring models exclusively on legal datasets. Alternatively, use adversarial training to penalize hallucination occurrences."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The proposal hinges on the assumption that a reliability scoring network trained on biomedical text generation datasets can effectively transfer to legal domain hallucination mitigation after some adaptation. However, biomedical and legal texts differ substantially in terminology, logic, and domain-specific consistency criteria. This assumption needs stronger empirical justification or preliminary evidence to validate cross-domain transferability before committing extensive resources to this approach. Without this, the core premise risks ineffectiveness, undermining the entire pipeline's soundness. Consider conducting initial domain similarity analyses or pilot adaptation experiments to confirm viability early on rather than relying primarily on adaptation post biomedical training data usage. This clarification and empirical support will greatly strengthen confidence in the approach's foundational soundness and practical relevance to legal NLP tasks.\n\n\n(Suggest revising the Proposed_Method section to explicitly address this assumption and incorporate a subsection on preliminary validation or justification of domain transfer.)\n\n"

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed experiment plan is comprehensive but may underestimate the difficulty and resources needed to obtain high-quality hallucination annotations in legal text generation datasets, which are specialized and costly to acquire, especially paired input-output data with detailed hallucination labels. The plan should clearly address how annotated data volume and quality will be achieved given these challenges, possibly involving expert annotators with legal background and clear annotation guidelines. Without sufficient annotated data, adaptation and training of reliability scorers may fail to generalize well. Also, the fallback plan of adversarial training is underspecified and could be elaborated with clearer methodological steps and criteria.\n\n\nEnhancing this aspect with a detailed annotation strategy and resource feasibility analysis will improve the experiment plan's feasibility and scientific rigor.\n\n(Suggest expanding Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan to explicitly include annotation procedures, annotator expertise requirements, and fallback technical design.)"
