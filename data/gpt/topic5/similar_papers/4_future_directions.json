        "title": "Ontology-Guided Few-Shot Adaptive Fine-Tuning for Legal LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often underperform when applied to legal documents due to domain shifts from general training data to specialized legal language. Labeled legal datasets are scarce, making it challenging to fine-tune models effectively.",
        "Motivation": "This project addresses the internal gap of insufficient integration between domain ontologies and adaptive fine-tuning in legal LLMs. By leveraging the identified hidden bridge between 'few-shot learning' and 'domain generalization', it proposes an ontology-guided adaptive fine-tuning paradigm to improve model calibration using minimal labeled samples.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel adaptive fine-tuning framework where domain ontologies (e.g., legal taxonomies, case law hierarchies) inform prompt construction and guide parameter calibration. The method applies ontology-driven data augmentation to generate semantically rich few-shot examples for fine-tuning with contrastive learning. It dynamically calibrates LLMs using an ontology-aware loss component to minimize domain-shift errors while maximizing semantic fidelity to legal concepts.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect diverse legal corpora integrating domain ontologies (e.g., legal statutes, precedents). 2. Select a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-4 or open-source equivalent). 3. Create ontology-driven few-shot prompts and augmented datasets. 4. Fine-tune the LLM adaptively using the proposed ontology-aware framework. 5. Evaluate on benchmark legal document tasks (e.g., contract clause classification, legal question answering). 6. Baselines: standard fine-tuning without ontology guidance, zero-shot LLM. 7. Metrics: accuracy, F1, calibration error, and domain generalization robustness.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Analyze the enforceability of a non-compete clause under California law.\" Expected Output: A structured summary identifying enforceability risks aligned with ontology concepts (e.g., 'non-compete', 'state law exceptions'), showcasing domain-aware reasoning.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If ontology guidance does not improve performance, fallback to augmenting few-shot learning with synthetic legal data generated via legal domain simulators. Analyze failure cases for ontology coverage gaps and incorporate additional legal knowledge sources."

        "Problem_Statement": "Legal data is highly sensitive and distributed across diverse institutions, with variations in modalities (text, scanned images) and formats, impeding centralized model training.",
        "Motivation": "This idea tackles the external gap of absent federated learning and multimodal approaches in legal LLMs, addressing privacy and domain-shift challenges simultaneously. It synthesizes advances in federated learning with multimodal foundation models, creating a privacy-preserving platform for robust cross-institutional legal analysis.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a federated learning system integrating a multimodal foundation model capable of processing both textual and document image data. Implement domain adaptation layers personalized per institution to handle domain shifts, and privacy-preserving protocols (e.g., differential privacy, secure aggregation). Employ an ontology-informed consistency loss ensuring semantic alignment of outputs across participants.",

        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-objective fine-tuning framework where legal LLM outputs are evaluated not only by traditional task accuracy but also by biomedical-inspired text quality metrics (e.g., factual consistency, data coverage, semantic similarity). Introduce a text attribute analyzer module assessing linguistic attributes (e.g., precision, hallucination indicators) and enforce explainability constraints during training through reinforcement learning with human feedback.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble a legal dataset annotated for factual correctness and evidential support. 2.

        "Proposed_Method": "Construct semantic bridging ontologies integrating concepts from multiple legal subdomains (e.g., contracts, intellectual property, criminal law). Embed these ontologies into the LLM architecture via knowledge-injected attention layers that guide few-shot adaptation. Use hierarchical prototype learning to refine domain-agnostic representations supporting out-of-distribution generalization.",

        "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a dynamic calibration framework integrating ontology-derived semantic consistency checks with learned uncertainty quantification modules (e.g., Bayesian layers or deep ensembles) within LLMs. The system flags low-confidence or semantically inconsistent outputs, triggering on-the-fly model recalibration via lightweight adaptive fine-tuning informed by ontology context.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets exhibiting domain shifts in legal topics. 2. Implement uncertainty estimation within a baseline LLM. 3. Encode legal ontologies as semantic validation layers checking output consistency. 4.
