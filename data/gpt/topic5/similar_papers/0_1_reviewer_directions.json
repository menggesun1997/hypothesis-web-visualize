    "title": "Co-Designed Continuous-Learning Advisory Systems for Financial Decisions in Elder Care Homes",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing financial advisory LLM systems do not adequately incorporate stakeholder feedback or continuous learning within real-world care home environments. This limits their ability to detect and correct misinformation dynamically, reducing decision relevance and adaptability to evolving contexts.",
    "Motivation": "This addresses an internal gap regarding difficulty in co-designing tools fitting complex care home settings and educates professionals to interpret AI outputs critically. Moreover, it exploits the hidden bridge between care home organizational themes and optimal treatment paradigms via program theory frameworks, enabling AI systems that evolve responsively with user feedback loops to mitigate hallucinations.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design and implement an interactive AI advisory tool using a program theory approach to model context-mechanism-outcome relationships specific to financial advisory in elder care homes. The system incorporates structured stakeholder input (residents, caregivers, financial advisors) via in-app dialogue prompts to capture corrective feedback. It employs reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and dynamic model updates so the LLM continuously improves its output quality and reduces misinformation. The design process involves participatory workshops ensuring alignment with user needs and critical interpretation skills development.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collaborate with multiple elder care homes to co-design the advisory tool interface and feedback mechanisms.\n2. Deploy a baseline LLM financial advisor with initial training on relevant datasets.\n3. Collect iterative feedback from stakeholders through simulated advisory sessions over several months.\n4. Apply RLHF techniques to adapt the LLM continuously.\n5. Evaluate misinformation reduction by expert auditing of output before and after continuous learning.\n6. Measure user trust, interpretation skills, and system usability through longitudinal surveys and focus groups.\n7. Compare with static LLM advisory deployed in similar settings.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Resident asks, \"Is now a good time to invest in bond funds given my fixed income?\"\nInitial output might overemphasize risk ignoring residentâ€™s liquidity constraints.\nStakeholder corrects: \"Suggest safer, liquid options due to health unpredictability.\"\nSystem updates advice in subsequent sessions to: \"Considering your fixed income and potential health expenses, low-risk, high-liquidity options like Treasury bills may be more appropriate than bond funds.\"\nShows improved alignment with context after feedback.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real stakeholder feedback collection is constrained, conduct extensive simulated user interactions with synthetic personas to train and test continuous learning. Alternatively, embed supervised correction datasets to bootstrap the RLHF loop. If RLHF convergence is slow, explore hybrid models combining rule-based constraints with learning-based generation."
