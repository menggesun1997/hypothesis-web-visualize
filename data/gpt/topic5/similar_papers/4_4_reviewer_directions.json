    "title": "Dynamic Calibration of Legal LLMs Using Ontology-Driven Uncertainty Estimation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Legal LLMs often produce overconfident and non-interpretable predictions in out-of-distribution settings, limiting reliability in high-stake legal applications.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing internal gaps in robustness and interpretability, this research combines ontology-based semantic constraints with uncertainty estimation techniques for dynamic model calibration to detect and mitigate domain-shift failures.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a dynamic calibration framework integrating ontology-derived semantic consistency checks with learned uncertainty quantification modules (e.g., Bayesian layers or deep ensembles) within LLMs. The system flags low-confidence or semantically inconsistent outputs, triggering on-the-fly model recalibration via lightweight adaptive fine-tuning informed by ontology context.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets exhibiting domain shifts in legal topics. 2. Implement uncertainty estimation within a baseline LLM. 3. Encode legal ontologies as semantic validation layers checking output consistency. 4. Train the joint model and test on out-of-distribution legal NLP tasks (e.g., authorship attribution, legal reasoning). 5. Evaluate calibration metrics (ECE, Brier score), interpretability assessments, and downstream task performance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A legal query from a jurisdiction with specialized law. Output: Model produces prediction with associated uncertainty and an ontology-based consistency report, flagging potential domain-shift and suggesting caution.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If joint uncertainty and ontology calibration is insufficient, test modular approaches isolating uncertainty estimation or ontology validation separately. Consider incorporating human-in-the-loop feedback for correction."

          "feedback_content": "The core mechanism of integrating ontology-derived semantic checks with uncertainty quantification and dynamic recalibration is promising but not sufficiently detailed. It is unclear how the lightweight adaptive fine-tuning will be triggered and performed on-the-fly without causing latency or stability issues in large LLMs. Clarify the exact interaction pipeline between uncertainty signals and ontology checks, the recalibration scope (which parameters or layers adapt), and how the method maintains computational efficiency in practical deployments for high-stakes legal tasks. This clarification is essential for assessing soundness and trustworthiness of the approach in real-world scenarios, especially given the complexity of legal ontologies and LLM behavior under domain shift. Please provide a more concrete architectural or algorithmic description of these mechanisms in the Proposed_Method section to enhance clarity and reproducibility."

          "feedback_content": "Given the idea's novelty is categorized as competitive but not groundbreaking, consider enhancing impact and distinctiveness by linking the legal LLM calibration framework with applications in cybersecurity systems or intelligent healthcare domains, which also require high reliability under domain shift. For example, adapting the ontology-driven uncertainty estimation approach to patient safety in electronic health records or securing classification outcomes in cybersecurity may broaden applicability and demonstrate the framework's versatility. Integrating cross-domain knowledge representation techniques or validating on datasets from intelligent transportation systems or autonomous driving can further strengthen impact and novelty, positioning the work at the intersection of legal NLP and other critical AI safety domains. Exploring this cross-pollination in motivation or future work would maximize broader appeal and societal benefits."
