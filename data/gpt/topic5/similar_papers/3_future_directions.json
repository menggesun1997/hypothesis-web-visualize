        "Problem_Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) used in scientific literature mining consume immense computational resources, leading to high environmental costs. Existing approaches fail to model and predict resource consumption dynamically during inference, causing inefficiencies and lack of runtime recovery mechanisms.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical internal gap of integrating finite element analysis (FEA) inspired modeling with AI/NLP pipelines to predict and manage computational load dynamically. By drawing the hidden bridge between FEA and NLP, we enable predictive simulation of LLM computation to apply efficient recovery strategies reducing energy use.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel modeling framework that treats computational load in LLM inference as an analogous physical stress-strain simulation modeled by FEA principles. This 'computational FEA' will simulate node-level computational resource distribution across transformer layers, predicting hotspots and potential failures. Using this simulation, dynamic throttling and recovery strategies trigger efficient resource scaling during inference, minimizing needless energy consumption. Coupled with domain knowledge graphs, the model adjusts inference paths based on content importance.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement the computational FEA model integrated into a standard LLM inference pipeline.\n2) Use scientific literature datasets like S2ORC to evaluate.\n3) Baselines include standard inference without load modeling and existing dynamic inference methods.\n4) Metrics: computational cost (FLOPs), energy consumption, inference latency, and accuracy.\n5) Perform ablation studies isolating the FEA-inspired load modeling component.",

        "Fallback_Plan": "If computational FEA modeling is inaccurate, fallback to heuristic-based resource throttling using layer-wise activation statistics. Also, test alternative physical simulation analogies such as fluid dynamics for resource modeling."
