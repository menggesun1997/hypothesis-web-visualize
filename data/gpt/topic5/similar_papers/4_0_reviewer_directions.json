    "title": "Ontology-Guided Few-Shot Adaptive Fine-Tuning for Legal LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often underperform when applied to legal documents due to domain shifts from general training data to specialized legal language. Labeled legal datasets are scarce, making it challenging to fine-tune models effectively.",
    "Motivation": "This project addresses the internal gap of insufficient integration between domain ontologies and adaptive fine-tuning in legal LLMs. By leveraging the identified hidden bridge between 'few-shot learning' and 'domain generalization', it proposes an ontology-guided adaptive fine-tuning paradigm to improve model calibration using minimal labeled samples.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a novel adaptive fine-tuning framework where domain ontologies (e.g., legal taxonomies, case law hierarchies) inform prompt construction and guide parameter calibration. The method applies ontology-driven data augmentation to generate semantically rich few-shot examples for fine-tuning with contrastive learning. It dynamically calibrates LLMs using an ontology-aware loss component to minimize domain-shift errors while maximizing semantic fidelity to legal concepts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect diverse legal corpora integrating domain ontologies (e.g., legal statutes, precedents). 2. Select a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-4 or open-source equivalent). 3. Create ontology-driven few-shot prompts and augmented datasets. 4. Fine-tune the LLM adaptively using the proposed ontology-aware framework. 5. Evaluate on benchmark legal document tasks (e.g., contract clause classification, legal question answering). 6. Baselines: standard fine-tuning without ontology guidance, zero-shot LLM. 7. Metrics: accuracy, F1, calibration error, and domain generalization robustness.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Analyze the enforceability of a non-compete clause under California law.\" Expected Output: A structured summary identifying enforceability risks aligned with ontology concepts (e.g., 'non-compete', 'state law exceptions'), showcasing domain-aware reasoning.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If ontology guidance does not improve performance, fallback to augmenting few-shot learning with synthetic legal data generated via legal domain simulators. Analyze failure cases for ontology coverage gaps and incorporate additional legal knowledge sources."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an innovative approach integrating domain ontologies into adaptive fine-tuning of legal LLMs via ontology-driven prompts, augmented data, and an ontology-aware loss. However, the precise mechanism of how ontology structures dynamically guide parameter calibration and how the ontology-aware loss is formulated lacks clarity. Providing a clear formalization or algorithmic description of these components is essential to validate the approach's soundness and reproducibility. Additionally, clarifying how contrastive learning interfaces with the ontology semantics will strengthen the argument of semantic fidelity preservation during fine-tuning, making the method more concrete and convincing to reviewers and practitioners alike. Enhancing this section with pseudocode or architectural diagrams would be highly beneficial for comprehension and implementation feasibility assessment. This clarification is critical before proceeding further to ensure the methodâ€™s core innovations are both novel and well-founded within existing literature and practices in legal NLP and domain adaptation frameworks.\n\n(Section targeted: Proposed_Method)"
