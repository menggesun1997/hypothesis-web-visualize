    "title": "Blockchain-enabled Adaptive Authentication with Neuro-Symbolic Verification",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing blockchain-based authentication systems are static and lack integration with adaptive learning agents, limiting their ability to respond effectively to evolving adversarial threats in autonomous customer service agents.",
    "Motivation": "Bridges the internal gap between reinforcement learning adaptability and blockchain access control by applying neuro-symbolic reasoning to dynamically update security policies on-chain, supporting verifiable and evolving authentication mechanisms, concretizing Opportunity 2.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a blockchain framework where security policies are stored as symbolic rules. RL agents interact with the blockchain to propose adaptive policy updates based on detected adversarial patterns. Neuro-symbolic modules verify policy consistency and correctness before committing updates, ensuring verifiability and adaptability. Smart contracts enforce updated authentication flows dynamically linked to agent experience.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement simulated blockchain environment with smart contracts for authentication policies. 2) Prepare adversarial customer service dialogue data. 3) Deploy RL agent to learn to defend via policy updates. 4) Create neuro-symbolic verifier to validate policy changes. 5) Evaluate security robustness, policy update correctness, and system overhead against static blockchain authentication.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Repeated adversarial authentication attempts using novel attack vectors. Expected Output: Agent detects new attack pattern, proposes updated policy, neuro-symbolic verifier approves, blockchain updates smart contract, rejecting attacks in future attempts with audit trail.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If blockchain performance bottlenecks emerge, offload some verification tasks off-chain with commit proofs. If symbolic verification is insufficiently scalable, utilize approximate or probabilistic policy validation with human expert oversight."

Clarify the specific logic rules, reasoning algorithms, and how they scale with policy complexity. Also, explain interfacing protocols between RL agents and symbolic modules to prevent conflicting updates, ensuring verifiable adaptivity without security lapses. This will solidify soundness by making the core mechanism transparent and reproducible, reinforcing trust in the system's correctness and security guarantees under adversarial conditions, which is critical given the novel hybrid architecture posed here. Detailed algorithmic sketches or pseudo-code and complexity analysis would greatly enhance understanding and evaluation of soundness for this complex interaction of components in your Proposed_Method section, beyond the conceptual narrative currently provided."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating and the presence of globally linked concepts related to multi-agent systems, state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, and trusted authority frameworks, the study can significantly benefit from incorporating multi-agent collaborative defense in adaptive policy updates. Extend the framework to include multiple RL agents representing diverse autonomous customer service entities that share attack intelligence and coordinate policy adjustments on-chain, secured by consensus mechanisms akin to Proof-of-Authority. This integration would leverage communication networks and swarm robotic system concepts to improve scalability, robustness, and real-world applicability, thus enhancing impact and novelty by connecting blockchain-enabled policy adaptation with cooperative multi-agent defense paradigms. Such integration could also exploit logic programming for decentralized trust establishment and secure routing to coordinate agents, thereby elevating both theoretical contribution and practical deployment feasibility within intelligent agent ecosystems."
