    "title": "Domain Knowledge Graph-Guided Adaptive Preprocessing for Energy-Efficient Literature Mining",
    "Problem_Statement": "Preprocessing large volumes of scientific literature for LLM training and inference leads to redundant computations and high energy usage due to lack of context-aware filtering and optimization.",
    "Motivation": "This proposal leverages the high-potential innovation opportunity of utilizing domain knowledge graphs and parsing models to reduce unnecessary computation by context-aware data preprocessing, directly filling the gap of absent optimization through recovery strategies for large-scale literature mining.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a dynamic domain knowledge graph (KG) from a corpus of scientific literature to represent key entities and their relationships. Use KG embeddings to guide adaptive preprocessing that filters and prioritizes text segments rich in relevant contextual info. Integrate advanced parsing to extract salient features improving fine-tuning efficiency of LLMsâ€”effectively pruning irrelevant data, reducing input size and computational waste.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build or use existing scientific KGs (e.g., PubMed KG).\n2) Implement adaptive preprocessing using KG-guided importance scoring.\n3) Fine-tune a BERT-based model on filtered vs. unfiltered corpora.\n4) Baselines: standard preprocessing and random filtering.\n5) Evaluate reduction in preprocessing computation, downstream task accuracy, and resource usage.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multiple abstracts from biomedical literature.\nExpected output: Preprocessing pipeline selects only abstracts and sections highly connected in the KG to target tasks, reducing input token count by 30% while maintaining task accuracy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If KG-guided filtering leads to loss of critical info, incorporate uncertainty estimation to fallback to minimal filtering when confidence in importance is low."
