    "title": "Cyber-Infused Federated Anomaly Detection for Bias Mitigation in AI-CDSS",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current AI clinical decision support systems (AI-CDSS) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and suffer from bias due to data heterogeneity and unrevealed anomalies, impeding safe deployment in healthcare.",
    "Motivation": "This idea uses the critical gap identifying overlooked cybersecurity anomaly detection methods as a bridge for bias mitigation in federated frameworks, directly addressing bias, adversarial robustness, and data privacy issues in decentralized healthcare AI.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a federated learning system embedding lightweight intrusion detection system (IDS)-inspired anomaly detectors within local clients' models. These detectors use cybersecurity concepts like behavior pattern baselining and statistical anomaly scoring on intermediate representations of medical image and text data. The system collaboratively identifies and suppresses biased, malicious, or anomalous data contributions in real-time. Models incorporate dynamic fairness-aware reweighting and secure aggregation to maintain privacy without losing interpretability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Use publicly available federated datasets, e.g., federated MIMIC-III text and decentralized chest X-ray images. 2) Implement baseline federated LLM and CNN models without anomaly detection. 3) Integrate IDS-inspired anomaly detection modules and dynamic fairness reweighting. 4) Evaluate bias metrics (e.g., demographic parity), adversarial robustness tests, and privacy leakage (membership inference). 5) Compare interpretability using explainability methods such as SHAP. 6) Conduct ablation studies on anomaly detection components.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multi-site radiology images with synthetic bias towards certain ethnic groups and injected adversarial perturbations. Output: The model flags anomalous data sources in federated rounds, reduces bias in diagnosis predictions across demographics, and resists adversarial attacks, improving fairness and robustness with maintained privacy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If IDS-based anomaly detection proves too noisy or computationally heavy, fallback to simpler statistical outlier detection techniques or use trusted execution environments to enhance security. Alternatively, shift focus to post hoc bias correction using explainability feedback."

        "title": "Cyber-Infused Federated Anomaly Detection with Theoretically-Grounded Fairness for Robust AI-CDSS",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current AI clinical decision support systems (AI-CDSS) deployed via federated learning face significant challenges, including susceptibility to adversarial attacks, bias arising from heterogeneous and non-iid medical data across sites, and difficulty detecting subtle anomalies in multimodal healthcare data streams. These challenges inhibit safe, fair, and privacy-preserving deployment of AI in critical healthcare settings.",
        "Motivation": "While federated learning frameworks protect user privacy in decentralized healthcare AI systems, they often overlook nuanced anomaly detection strategies rooted in cybersecurity, limiting robustness and bias mitigation. Our proposal uniquely bridges IDS-inspired anomaly detection with fairness-aware federated learning by providing a theoretically grounded mechanism to detect anomalous patterns across multimodal medical data (images and text) without compromising privacy or interpretability. By integrating personalized federated learning concepts and smart communication strategies, this approach advances beyond existing models by dynamically mitigating bias and adversarial risks at client-level granularity, enhancing trustworthiness and applicability in AI-enabled e-health systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-stage federated anomaly detection and fairness framework with the following key components:\n\n1) **Multimodal Embedding and Behavior Baselines:** Each client preprocesses local heterogeneous medical data (e.g., chest X-rays via CNN embeddings and clinical notes via LLM embeddings) into intermediate latent representations. For each modality, we construct personalized behavior baselines using moving-window exponential smoothing and kernel density estimations to model normal representation distributions.\n\n2) **IDS-Inspired Anomaly Scoring:** Leveraging statistical anomaly detection principles from IDS, we compute local anomaly scores by measuring Mahalanobis distance and cosine similarity deviations of new latent samples relative to client-specific behavior baselines. These scores quantify deviations potentially caused by bias, adversarial perturbations, or corrupted data.\n\n3) **Federated Secure Aggregation of Anomaly and Gradient Updates:** Anomaly scores and model gradients are securely aggregated at the server using cryptographic aggregation protocols preserving data privacy. This aggregation enables global detection of anomalous client contributions without exposing raw data.\n\n4) **Dynamic Fairness-aware Reweighting Algorithm:** The server employs a theoretically justified reweighting scheme where client model updates are weighted inversely proportional to their aggregated anomaly scores, adjusted by fairness constraints targeting demographic parity metrics. This ensures model updates promoting equitable performance across patient subgroups.\n\n5) **Personalized Federated Learning and Communication Optimization:** To address client heterogeneity and computational overhead, clients maintain personalized model components adapting to local distributions, communicated in optimized rounds that balance quality-of-service and communication costs.\n\n6) **Interpretability and Explanation Integration:** We use SHAP values on federated model predictions to generate interpretable explanations at client and server levels, linking anomaly detection outputs to clinical features, thus not compromising model interpretability.\n\nAlgorithmic pseudo-code and formal proofs of convergence and fairness guarantees under secure aggregation and anomaly reweighting are provided to substantiate soundness and practical trade-offs.\n\nThis integrative approach exploits the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity strategies to achieve robust, fair, and privacy-preserving AI-CDSS deployment in distributed healthcare environments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Phase 1: Feasibility and Anomaly Detection Evaluation\n1) Prepare federated setups using federated MIMIC-III clinical text and decentralized chest X-ray image datasets with realistic client heterogeneity simulated.\n2) Implement local multimodal embedding extraction pipelines.\n3) Develop and validate IDS-inspired anomaly scoring modules at each client.\n4) Evaluate anomaly detection accuracy using known synthetic anomalies and adversarial perturbations.\n5) Measure computational overhead and communication costs.\n\nPhase 2: Bias Mitigation and Robustness Evaluation\n6) Incorporate dynamic fairness-aware reweighting and secure aggregation protocols.\n7) Simulate synthetic demographic bias distributions and adversarial client attacks; define these perturbations explicitly and share generation scripts for reproducibility.\n8) Evaluate federated model bias metrics (e.g., demographic parity difference, equal opportunity), adversarial robustness via adaptive attacks, and privacy leakage through membership inference tests.\n\nPhase 3: Interpretability and Ablation Studies\n9) Apply SHAP-based interpretability analyses to assess explanation fidelity.\n10) Conduct ablation studies by removing anomaly detection and reweighting modules to quantify their impact.\n11) Report aggregated results focusing on trade-offs among fairness, robustness, interpretability, and resource consumption.\n\nThroughout, record federated learning rounds, client participation rates, and resource usage. Experiments will be deployed on high-performance clusters mimicking healthcare networks with IoT-enabled edge devices to emulate real-world e-health systems.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multi-institutional chest X-ray images and clinical notes with introduced synthetic demographic biases favoring one ethnicity, mixed with adversarial perturbations crafted using PGD attacks mimicking realistic data poisoning. Output: The system identifies anomalous clients via elevated anomaly scores, adjusts update weights dynamically to suppress biased influences, maintains or improves demographic parity in diagnostic predictions, withstands adversarial attacks reducing error rate increases, and provides interpretable explanations linking anomalies to specific features without revealing sensitive data. The system achieves these within defined privacy budgets and communication constraints, demonstrating generalizable robustness and fairness in realistic federated medical AI settings.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If IDS-inspired anomaly detection causes excessive false positives or computational overhead, fallback strategies include:\n- Simplifying anomaly scoring to lightweight statistical methods like clustering-based outlier detection on embeddings.\n- Employing personalized federated learning to isolate heterogeneous behaviors without explicit anomaly detection.\n- Utilizing trusted execution environments at client devices for secure model updates.\n- Shifting focus to enhanced post hoc bias correction through federated explainability feedback loops using interpretable surrogate models.\nThese alternatives emphasize maintaining privacy and fairness while balancing resource feasibility and system robustness."

However, the mechanism lacks clarity on how behavior pattern baselining and statistical anomaly scoring interact with intermediate medical image and text representations, which can be highly heterogeneous and multimodal. Additionally, it is unclear how these cybersecurity techniques transfer from traditional IDS contexts to federated medical AI scenarios without compromising model performance or interpretability. The interplay between anomaly detection, dynamic fairness-aware reweighting, and secure aggregation needs more precise operational details and theoretical justification to establish soundness and ensure practical utility in clinical decision support systems. I recommend providing detailed algorithmic steps or pseudo-code and theoretical grounding for these components to clarify how the system maintains fairness, robustness, and interpretability concurrently without contradiction or excessive overheads, especially given the sensitive medical domain and privacy constraints. This will substantiate the core technical assumptions and illuminate potential trade-offs or failure modes inherent in the approach, which is critical for soundness validation and trustworthiness of the proposed framework in healthcare AI deployments.\n\nTarget: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "While the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is structured logically and targets appropriate datasets (federated MIMIC-III and chest X-ray images), the plan could face challenges in feasibility primarily due to complexity and evaluation scope. Federated learning with integrated IDS-based anomaly detection may be computationally expensive and require extensive infrastructure setup, possibly beyond typical academic resource availability. The plan proposes a comprehensive set of bias, adversarial robustness, privacy leakage, and interpretability evaluations, combined with ablation studies, which might be overly ambitious for an initial implementation. To improve feasibility, I suggest prioritizing evaluation tasks in phased experiments—starting with anomaly detection effectiveness and bias mitigation separately before combining them. Also, specify computational resources, federated setup parameters (e.g., communication rounds, client heterogeneity), and potential simulation of adversarial attacks and privacy attacks in realistic conditions. Clarify how synthetic biases and adversarial perturbations will be crafted and controlled to ensure reproducibility. Addressing these points will lead to a more scientifically sound and practically executable experimental plan, reducing risks of inconclusive results or undue delays in validating the novel methodology.\n\nTarget: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
