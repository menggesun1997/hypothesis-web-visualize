    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Gastrointestinal cancer can be treated using a flexible endoscope through a natural orifice. However, treatment instruments with limited degrees of freedom (DOFs) require a highly skilled operator. Articulated devices useful for endoluminal procedures, such as endoscopic submucosal dissection and biopsy, have been developed. These devices enable dexterous operation in a narrow lumen; however, they suffer from limitations such as large size and high cost. To overcome these limitations, we developed a 2.5-mm articulated forceps that can be inserted into a standard endoscope channel based on a compliant mechanism.\nMETHODS: The compliant mechanism allows the device to be compact and affordable, which is possible due to its monolithic structure. The proposed mechanism consists of two segments, 1-DOF grasping and 2-DOF bending, that are actuated by tendon-sheath mechanisms. A prototype was designed based on finite element analysis results.\nRESULTS: To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism, we fabricated the prototype using a 3D printer. A series of mechanical performance tests on the prototype revealed that it achieved the following specifications: (1) DOF: 1-DOF grasping + 2-DOF bending, (2) outer diameter: 2.5 mm, (3) length of the bending segment: 30 mm, and (4) range of motion: [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] (grasping) and [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] (bending). Finally, we performed a tissue manipulation test on an excised porcine colon and found that a piece of mucous membrane tissue was successfully resected using an electric knife while being lifted with the developed forceps.\nCONCLUSION: The results of the evaluation experiment demonstrated a positive feasibility of the proposed mechanism, which has a simpler structure compared to those of other conventional mechanisms; furthermore, it is potentially more cost-effective and is disposable. The mechanical design, prototype implementation, and evaluations are reported in this paper.",
