    "title": "Human-Centric Trust Modeling for Behavioral Authentication in Autonomous Agents",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current AI-driven authentication mechanisms ignore dynamic human behavioral trust factors, resulting in vulnerabilities against unauthorized access in customer service scenarios.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external gap of missing socio-technical security considerations by integrating behavioral cybersecurity and trust dynamics into autonomous authentication design, fulfilling Opportunity 3's potential for holistic risk mitigation beyond purely technical defenses.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a trust-aware authentication framework that models user behavior patterns, interaction histories, and contextual cues using behavioral cybersecurity principles. Embed this trust model into the agent's decision pipeline, adjusting authentication requirements adaptively. Incorporate feedback loops from human trust signals to refine authentication stringency, balancing user convenience and security dynamically.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect data on user-agent interactions, including behavioral biometrics and contextual factors. 2) Build baselines with standard authentication methods. 3) Design and implement trust modeling algorithms integrating behavioral features. 4) Integrate trust model into authentication decision logic. 5) Evaluate unauthorized access rates, false positives/negatives, user satisfaction, and trust metrics. 6) Perform live user studies to validate real-world efficacy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A returning user's voice pattern and typing cadence slightly deviating due to illness. Expected Output: Trust model recognizes legitimate behavioral variance, maintains authentication with adjusted thresholds, ensuring smooth user experience without compromising security.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If behavioral data is insufficient or noisy, combine with multi-factor authentication fallback. Employ incremental learning to improve trust modeling over time. If trust adaptation reduces security, introduce conservative policy thresholds and human-in-the-loop verification."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a trust-aware authentication framework integrating behavioral cybersecurity principles into the agent's decision pipeline. However, the mechanism by which behavioral and contextual data are quantitatively modeled, aggregated, and converted into dynamic authentication requirements is under-specified. Clarify the algorithmic approach, e.g., specific modeling techniques (statistical, machine learning, or hybrid), how human trust signals are captured and integrated, and how thresholds adapt in real time. This clarity is vital to assess soundness and reproducibility and to ensure the feedback loops avoid oscillations or feedback delays degrading security or user experience. Include more detailed pseudocode or theoretical grounding for trust incorporation within the authentication logic to strengthen mechanistic soundness and implementation feasibility in realistic deployments (e.g., voice/typing variability). This will also help differentiate from existing adaptive authentication models in the competitive literature space, addressing the [NOV-COMPETITIVE] context effectively.

          "feedback_content": "Given the idea's pre-screened novelty competitiveness, integrating emerging paradigms like federated learning or blockchain technology could significantly boost the robustness and decentralized trustworthiness of the proposed framework. For example, employing federated learning would enable privacy-preserving, decentralized behavioral model training across multiple autonomous agents or organizations without sharing raw data, addressing privacy and scalability challenges. Blockchain could provide tamper-proof logging of trust signals and authentication decisions, enhancing auditability and resistance to adversarial manipulation. Further, linking with recent advances in adversarial machine learning could strengthen resilience against spoofing or imitation attacks. These integrations could increase real-world impact, scalability, and novelty beyond isolated trust modeling. Recommend exploring these globally-linked concepts in the next iteration to advance both scientific contribution and practical deployment potential. Target Section: Proposed_Method."
