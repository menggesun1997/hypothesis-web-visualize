    "title": "Dynamic Calibration of Legal LLMs Using Ontology-Driven Uncertainty Estimation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Legal LLMs often produce overconfident and non-interpretable predictions in out-of-distribution settings, limiting reliability in high-stake legal applications.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing internal gaps in robustness and interpretability, this research combines ontology-based semantic constraints with uncertainty estimation techniques for dynamic model calibration to detect and mitigate domain-shift failures.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a dynamic calibration framework integrating ontology-derived semantic consistency checks with learned uncertainty quantification modules (e.g., Bayesian layers or deep ensembles) within LLMs. The system flags low-confidence or semantically inconsistent outputs, triggering on-the-fly model recalibration via lightweight adaptive fine-tuning informed by ontology context.",

Encode legal ontologies as semantic validation layers checking output consistency. 4. Train the joint model and test on out-of-distribution legal NLP tasks (e.g., authorship attribution, legal reasoning). 5. Evaluate calibration metrics (ECE, Brier score), interpretability assessments, and downstream task performance.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A legal query from a jurisdiction with specialized law. Output: Model produces prediction with associated uncertainty and an ontology-based consistency report, flagging potential domain-shift and suggesting caution.",

        "title": "Dynamic Calibration of Legal and Safety-Critical LLMs Using Ontology-Driven Uncertainty Estimation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) applied in legal and other safety-critical domains such as intelligent healthcare and cybersecurity frequently exhibit overconfident, non-interpretable outputs, especially under domain shifts. This undermines their reliability and trustworthiness in high-stakes decision contexts, where semantic inconsistencies and uncertain predictions can lead to critical errors.",
        "Motivation": "While existing LLM calibration techniques improve reliability to some extent, they often lack tightly-coupled mechanisms that leverage structured domain knowledge and dynamic adaptation to shifting contexts. We propose a novel, integrated framework that couples ontology-driven semantic validation with uncertainty estimation to dynamically recalibrate LLMs in real time. By explicitly incorporating legal ontologies alongside ontologies from domains including cybersecurity and intelligent healthcare (e.g., electronic health records and patient safety ontologies), our approach significantly extends the applicability and impact of model calibration under distributional shifts. This cross-domain integration and the fine-grained dynamic calibration mechanism differentiate our work from existing static or purely uncertainty-based methods, addressing key limitations and propelling advances in AI safety for legal NLP and beyond.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We design a modular architecture combining (1) uncertainty quantification modules integrated within LLM layers—employing Bayesian approximations (e.g., Monte Carlo Dropout) and lightweight deep ensembles—and (2) ontology-based semantic consistency validators that encode complex domain ontologies from legal, cybersecurity, and intelligent healthcare areas as formal constraints. At inference, the LLM outputs predictions coupled with quantified uncertainty scores. Concurrently, outputs are checked against the semantic constraints derived from relevant ontologies to detect inconsistencies caused by domain shifts. When uncertainty exceeds a calibrated threshold and/or semantic violations occur, a dynamic recalibration module is triggered:\n\n- **Triggering:** The dynamic recalibration trigger combines uncertainty metrics and ontology violation counts into a composite risk score.\n- **Scope of Adaptation:** To ensure computational efficiency and stability on large LLMs, recalibration is confined to lightweight adapter modules—small bottleneck layers or parameter-efficient fine-tuning layers—in select transformer blocks rather than full model updates.\n- **Adaptation Process:** Using data points flagged as out-of-distribution, the adapters are fine-tuned quickly online using a small buffer of recent instances, leveraging ontology-derived semantic feedback as auxiliary supervision signals.\n- **Computational Efficiency:** Online adapter fine-tuning is optimized with a low iteration limit and efficient optimizers. The semantic validators operate asynchronously with cached ontology lookups and precompiled rules to guarantee minimal latency impact.\n\nTogether, this pipeline dynamically harmonizes uncertainty signals and rich ontology semantics to recalibrate model confidence and predictions on-the-fly in high-stakes scenarios in legal NLP, cybersecurity classification, and patient safety applications.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Aggregate multi-domain datasets exhibiting domain shifts: legal documents (jurisdictional variation), cybersecurity incident reports, and EHR-derived clinical notes related to patient safety.\n2. Implement uncertainty estimation modules within a strong baseline LLM (e.g., a fine-tuned GPT variant), incorporating Bayesian and ensemble techniques.\n3. Encode domain ontologies as formal semantic validators: legal ontologies for jurisdictional rules, cybersecurity threat ontologies, and patient safety ontologies.\n4. Integrate and validate the dynamic recalibration pipeline with adapter-layer fine-tuning triggered by composite risk scores.\n5. Evaluate on out-of-distribution tasks across domains (e.g., legal authorship attribution with jurisdiction shifts, malware classification, adverse event detection in EHRs).\n6. Measure calibration quality (ECE, Brier score), semantic consistency rates, latency overhead, and downstream task accuracy.\n7. Conduct ablation studies dissecting the relative contributions of uncertainty quantification, ontology validation, and dynamic adapter recalibration.\n8. Analyze computational trade-offs to verify feasibility in real-world high-stakes deployment scenarios.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Legal query from a jurisdiction with specialized statutes.\nOutput: LLM prediction with calibrated uncertainty score, accompanied by an ontology-based semantic consistency report highlighting any domain-shift-related risks or ontology violations. If risks exceed threshold, dynamic recalibration adapts adapter layers online, subsequently updating predictions with improved confidence reliability.\n\nInput: Cybersecurity log data classification under novel attack patterns.\nOutput: Classification outcomes with uncertainty quantification, ontology-driven threat model consistency checks, and automatic recalibration to mitigate erroneous overconfident outputs.\n\nInput: Patient records with new clinical scenarios.\nOutput: Clinical event detection predictions with uncertainty flags and ontology-based safety checks prompting adapter fine-tuning to refine model safety performance.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If joint uncertainty and ontology-driven dynamic recalibration does not sufficiently address domain shift challenges, we will:\n- Isolate and extensively evaluate modular components—uncertainty estimation and ontology validation—separately to understand limitations.\n- Explore heavier human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms integrating expert corrections for critical error cases.\n- Investigate alternative domain adaptation methods such as prompt-based continual learning or meta-learning.\n- Consider simplifying the ontology constraints or incorporating knowledge distillation techniques to reduce computational overhead."
