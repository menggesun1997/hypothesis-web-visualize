    "abstract": "This survey explores the transformative impact of foundation models (FMs) in artificial intelligence, focusing on their integration with federated learning (FL) in biomedical research. Foundation models such as ChatGPT, LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and multimodal patient interactions. The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges, and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs and FL, laying the groundwork for healthcare innovations.",

In the field of ophthalmology, LLMs not only assist doctors in diagnosing eye diseases, optimizing treatment recommendations, improving medical record-writing efficiency, and providing educational training support, but also offer strong support for ophthalmic researchers in data processing and innovative research. LLMs, however, face numerous challenges in clinical applications, such as knowledge boundaries, AI hallucinations, and data privacy protection.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: To examine the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) and assess its impact on medical imaging, diagnostic workflows, and patient outcomes. This review explores the technological evolution, key advancements, and challenges associated with AI-enhanced PACS in healthcare settings.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, covering articles from January 2000 to October 2024. Search terms included \"artificial intelligence,\" \"machine learning,\" \"deep learning,\" and \"PACS,\" combined with keywords related to diagnostic accuracy and workflow optimization. Articles were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, focusing on peerreviewed studies that discussed AI applications in PACS, innovations in medical imaging, and workflow improvements. A total of 183 studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising original research, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses.\nRESULTS: AI integration in PACS has significantly enhanced diagnostic accuracy, achieving improvements of up to 93.2% in some imaging modalities, such as early tumor detection and anomaly identification. Workflow efficiency has been transformed, with diagnostic times reduced by up to 90% for critical conditions like intracranial hemorrhages. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in image segmentation, achieving up to 94% accuracy, and in motion artifact correction, further enhancing diagnostic precision. Natural language processing (NLP) tools have expedited radiology workflows, reducing reporting times by 30-50% and improving consistency in report generation. Cloudbased solutions have also improved accessibility, enabling real-time collaboration and remote diagnostics. However, challenges in data privacy, regulatory compliance, and interoperability persist, emphasizing the need for standardized frameworks and robust security protocols. Conclusions The integration of AI into PACS represents a pivotal transformation in medical imaging, offering improved diagnostic workflows and potential for personalized patient care. Addressing existing challenges and enhancing interoperability will be essential for maximizing the benefits of AIpowered PACS in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "<p>Despite major advances in artificial intelligence (AI) research for healthcare, the deployment and adoption of AI technologies remain limited in clinical practice. This paper describes the FUTURE-AI framework, which provides guidance for the development and deployment of trustworthy AI tools in healthcare. The FUTURE-AI Consortium was founded in 2021 and comprises 117 interdisciplinary experts from 50 countries representing all continents, including AI scientists, clinical researchers, biomedical ethicists, and social scientists. Over a two year period, the FUTURE-AI guideline was established through consensus based on six guiding principles—fairness, universality, traceability, usability, robustness, and explainability. To operationalise trustworthy AI in healthcare, a set of 30 best practices were defined, addressing technical, clinical, socioethical, and legal dimensions. The recommendations cover the entire lifecycle of healthcare AI, from design, development, and validation to regulation, deployment, and monitoring.</p>",

    "abstract": "In the field of medical image analysis within deep learning (DL), the importance of employing advanced DL techniques cannot be overstated. DL has achieved impressive results in various areas, making it particularly noteworthy for medical image analysis in healthcare. The integration of DL with medical image analysis enables real-time analysis of vast and intricate datasets, yielding insights that significantly enhance healthcare outcomes and operational efficiency in the industry. This extensive review of existing literature conducts a thorough examination of the most recent deep learning (DL) approaches designed to address the difficulties faced in medical healthcare, particularly focusing on the use of deep learning algorithms in medical image analysis. Falling all the investigated papers into five different categories in terms of their techniques, we have assessed them according to some critical parameters. Through a systematic categorization of state-of-the-art DL techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) models, and hybrid models, this study explores their underlying principles, advantages, limitations, methodologies, simulation environments, and datasets. Based on our results, Python was the most frequent programming language used for implementing the proposed methods in the investigated papers.

    "title": "Enhancing AI-CDSS with U-AnoGAN: Tackling data imbalance",
    "year": 2023,
    "citationCount": 7,
    "fieldCitationRatio": NaN,
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) have substantially evolved, aiding healthcare professionals in informed patient care decision-making. The integration of AI, encompassing machine learning and natural language processing, has notably enhanced the capabilities of CDSS. However, a significant challenge remains in addressing data imbalance and the black box nature of AI algorithms, particularly for rare diseases or underrepresented demographic groups. This study aims to propose a model, U-AnoGAN, designed to overcome these hurdles and augment the diagnostic accuracy of AI-integrated CDSS.\nMETHODS: The U-AnoGAN was trained using masks derived from normal data, focusing on the Covid-19 and pneumonia datasets. Anomaly scores were calculated to assess the model's performance compared to existing AnoGAN-related algorithms. The study also evaluated the model's interpretability through the visualization of abnormal regions.\nRESULTS: The results indicated that U-AnoGAN surpassed its counterparts in performance and interpretability. It effectively addressed the data imbalance problem by necessitating only normal data and showcased enhanced diagnostic accuracy. Precision, sensitivity, and specificity values reflected U-AnoGAN's superior capability in accurate disease prediction, diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and adverse event detection.\nCONCLUSIONS: U-AnoGAN significantly bolsters the predictive power of AI-integrated CDSS, enabling more precise and timely diagnoses while providing better visualization to potentially overcome the black box problem. This model presents tremendous potential in elevating patient care with advanced AI tools and fostering more accurate and effective decision-making in healthcare environments. As the healthcare sector grapples with escalating data complexity and volume, the importance of models like U-AnoGAN in enhancing CDSS cannot be overstated.",

    "year": 2025,
    "citationCount": 1,

    "abstract": "In an era of rapid technological advancements, generative artificial intelligence and foundation models are reshaping industries and offering new advanced solutions in a wide range of scientific areas, particularly in public and environmental health. However, foundation models have previously mostly focused on understanding and generating text, while geospatial features, interrelations, flows and correlations have been neglected. Thus, this paper outlines the importance of research into Geospatial Foundation Models, which have the potential to revolutionise digital health surveillance and public health. We examine the latest advances, opportunities, challenges, and ethical considerations of geospatial foundation models for research and applications in digital health. We focus on the specific challenges of integrating geospatial context with foundation models and lay out the future potential for multimodal geospatial foundation models for a variety of research avenues in digital health surveillance and health assessment.",

    "abstract": "In the domain of using DL-based methods in medical and healthcare prediction systems, the utilization of state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) methodologies assumes paramount significance. DL has attained remarkable achievements across diverse domains, rendering its efficacy particularly noteworthy in this context. The integration of DL with health and medical prediction systems enables real-time analysis of vast and intricate datasets, yielding insights that significantly enhance healthcare outcomes and operational efficiency in the industry. This comprehensive literature review systematically investigates the latest DL solutions for the challenges encountered in medical healthcare, with a specific emphasis on DL applications in the medical domain. By categorizing cutting-edge DL approaches into distinct categories, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), long short-term memory (LSTM) models, support vector machine (SVM), and hybrid models, this study delves into their underlying principles, merits, limitations, methodologies, simulation environments, and datasets. Notably, the majority of the scrutinized articles were published in 2022, underscoring the contemporaneous nature of the research. Moreover, this review accentuates the forefront advancements in DL techniques and their practical applications within the realm of medical prediction systems, while simultaneously addressing the challenges that hinder the widespread implementation of DL in image segmentation within the medical healthcare domains. These discerned insights serve as compelling impetuses for future studies aimed at the progressive advancement of using DL-based methods in medical and health prediction systems. The evaluation metrics employed across the reviewed articles encompass a broad spectrum of features, encompassing accuracy, precision, specificity, F-score, adoptability, adaptability, and scalability.",
