Unstructured clinical notes contain valuable information for identifying rare diseases, but manual curation is time-consuming and prone to subjectivity. This study aims to develop a hybrid approach combining dictionary-based natural language processing (NLP) tools with large language models (LLMs) to improve rare disease identification from unstructured clinical reports.MethodsWe propose a novel hybrid framework that integrates the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO) and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to create a comprehensive rare disease vocabulary. SemEHR, a dictionary-based NLP tool, is employed to extract rare disease mentions from clinical notes. To refine the results and improve accuracy, we leverage various LLMs, including LLaMA3, Phi3-mini, and domain-specific models like OpenBioLLM and BioMistral. Different prompting strategies, such as zero-shot, few-shot, and knowledge-augmented generation, are explored to optimize the LLMs’ performance.ResultsThe proposed hybrid approach demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional NLP systems and standalone LLMs. LLaMA3 and Phi3-mini achieve the highest F1 scores in rare disease identification. Few-shot prompting with 1-3 examples yields the best results, while knowledge-augmented generation shows limited improvement. Notably, the approach uncovers a significant number of potential rare disease cases not documented in structured diagnostic records, highlighting its ability to identify previously unrecognized patients.ConclusionThe hybrid approach combining dictionary-based NLP tools with LLMs shows great promise for improving rare disease identification from unstructured clinical reports. By leveraging the strengths of both techniques, the method demonstrates superior performance and the potential to uncover hidden rare disease cases. Further research is needed to address limitations related to ontology mapping and overlapping case identification, and to integrate the approach into clinical practice for early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Open challenges and opportunities in federated foundation models towards biomedical healthcare', 'abstract': 'This survey explores the transformative impact of foundation models (FMs) in artificial intelligence, focusing on their integration with federated learning (FL) in biomedical research.

Central nodes highlight reliance on foundational ontologies (e.g., Unified Medical Language System, Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology), core NLP tools, and techniques such as few-shot learning, tokenization, and text attribute modeling.

    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps identified in the foundational literature include challenges in effectively managing domain-shift—LLMs trained on broad data underperform on specific, sensitive domains like legal or medical texts. There is limited integration of domain ontologies with adaptive fine-tuning methods, insufficient robustness in out-of-distribution detection, and the difficulty of interpreting LLM decisions in high-stake contexts such as authorship attribution and legal information retrieval. The local network’s lack of bridge nodes signals insufficient cross-linking between NLP tool-based ontology methods and advanced LLM fine-tuning paradigms, pointing to siloed research clusters.\n\nExternally, the global context reveals promising hidden bridges such as coupling AGI’s few-shot learning capabilities with domain adaptation strategies for better out-of-distribution generalization. Specifically, bridging 'few-shot' and 'artificial general intelligence' concepts with 'domain generalization' and 'task adaptation' could directly tackle domain-shift failures. Additionally, integrating 'text attributes' analytics with 'state-of-the-art natural language generation' and quality metrics from biomedical report generation literature offers opportunities to improve reliability and explainability in legal document analysis. The absence of multimodal and federated learning approaches within this narrow legal analysis cluster represents another novel frontier, addressing data privacy and diverse modality integration.",
