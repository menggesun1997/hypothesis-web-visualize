    "title": "Integrating Biomedical Text Generation Metrics for Explainable Legal LLM Outputs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs in legal document analysis often hallucinate or generate outputs lacking interpretability, especially when domain-shift occurs, reducing trustworthiness in legal decision support.",
    "Motivation": "This project bridges biomedical report generation literature and legal NLP by incorporating advanced text attribute analytics and generation quality metrics into legal LLM fine-tuning, directly addressing hallucination and explainability gaps identified in the landscape map.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-objective fine-tuning framework where legal LLM outputs are evaluated not only by traditional task accuracy but also by biomedical-inspired text quality metrics (e.g., factual consistency, data coverage, semantic similarity). Introduce a text attribute analyzer module assessing linguistic attributes (e.g., precision, hallucination indicators) and enforce explainability constraints during training through reinforcement learning with human feedback.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Assemble a legal dataset annotated for factual correctness and evidential support. 2. Adapt biomedical report generation evaluation metrics for legal domain characteristics. 3. Fine-tune a legal LLM incorporating these metrics as reward signals. 4. Compare with standard fine-tuning approaches on legal document summarization and retrieval tasks. 5. Evaluate interpretability with human expert ratings alongside automated metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Summarize the key obligations of parties in a contract with references.\" Output: A coherent summary with explicit references to contract clauses, minimal hallucination, and quantifiable confidence scores aligned with text attributes.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-objective optimization proves unstable, decouple the explanation module as a post-hoc verification step. Incorporate active learning to iteratively improve factuality. Explore alternative explainability frameworks such as counterfactual generation."

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan outlines sensible stages but lacks specifics critical for reproducibility and scientific rigor. For example, the plan should explicitly describe how the legal dataset will be annotated for factual correctness and evidential support, ensuring high inter-annotator agreement and clear annotation guidelines. Additionally, more detail is needed on how biomedical metrics will be adapted to capture the unique characteristics of legal language rather than assume direct transferability. The reinforcement learning with human feedback component also requires elaboration on how human feedback will be collected, what feedback schema will be used, and how it integrates into fine-tuning. It is important to clarify these details upfront to demonstrate experimental feasibility and reduce risks related to dataset quality and training stability, especially given the fallback plan's mention of instability in multi-objective optimization. Strengthening this section with specific protocols, evaluation criteria, and risk mitigation will make the plan more robust and feasible to execute successfully in a competitive research area.  Targeting 'Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan' with improved precision will significantly enhance the overall credibility of the study's feasibility profile."

          "feedback_content": "To enhance novelty and impact beyond the competitive space of legal LLM fine-tuning for hallucination and explainability, the proposal should consider integrating insights from 'attribute-based access control' and 'security of electronic health records' within the broader natural language processing domain. Specifically, introducing a module that not only evaluates factual consistency and hallucination but also assesses compliance with data security and privacy policies when generating legal text could provide a unique value proposition. This could involve conditioning the generation or explanations on access control policies relevant to sensitive legal documents, ensuring that generated outputs adhere to confidentiality requirements along with factual accuracy. Leveraging knowledge from artificial intelligence adoption in healthcare tasks (e.g., cancer care) may provide transferable frameworks for explainability and ethics compliance. This multidimensional integration would broaden the impact from explainability alone to trustworthy, secure, and compliant AI-assisted legal decision support, setting the work apart in a highly competitive field by aligning with emerging real-world constraints and regulatory concerns. Targeting 'Proposed_Method' to embed security and compliance considerations in tandem with factuality would elevate the contribution markedly."
