        "Proposed_Method": "1) Develop a financial ontology mapping key concepts and constraints; 2) Implement a calibration layer that adjusts LLM output confidence by comparing predicted facts against the ontology; 3) Link all provenance metadata to blockchain entries ensuring auditable, tamper-proof traceability; 4) Use calibrated confidence thresholds to suppress or highlight output uncertainty.",

        "title": "Interactive Ontology-Guided LLM Calibration with Blockchain-Backed Provenance and Digital Forensics for Trustworthy Financial Advice",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed for financial advice suffer from miscalibrated confidence scores and hallucinations, which reduce user trust and complicate error detection. Current approaches insufficiently specify how ontological constraints and immutable provenance can be dynamically integrated to recalibrate confidence in real-time. Moreover, they lack user-centric interfaces and forensic auditing mechanisms that leverage provenance data to detect suspicious advice patterns and enhance actionable trustworthiness.",
        "Motivation": "While ontology-based calibration, confidence adjustment, and blockchain provenance are individually explored, their isolated combination limits impact. By tightly integrating these components with explainable human-computer interaction (HCI) elements and advanced digital forensic analysis, this work advances beyond existing methods to create a comprehensive, user-facing system. This system not only quantitatively recalibrates LLM outputs based on ontology and provenance constraints in real-time but also empowers users through interactive trust visualizations and automated forensic alerts, thereby significantly elevating reliability, transparency, and usability in financial AI assistants.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Our method innovates via a four-layer architecture: (1) Ontology Layer—a formal financial ontology encodes domain concepts, relations, and logical constraints. (2) Calibration Layer—implements a confidence recalibration module receiving LLM-generated facts and confidence scores; it quantitatively evaluates each fact against ontology constraints using a scoring function that penalizes inconsistencies detected via logical inference engines and semantic similarity metrics. Confidence scores are adjusted by multiplying original scores with an ontology coherence factor derived from these evaluations. (3) Provenance & Blockchain Layer—provenance metadata (data sources, timestamps, transformation logs) about inputs and outputs are hashed and immutably stored in a permissioned blockchain. This layer provides APIs to retrieve provenance proofs in real-time. The recalibration module integrates these proofs by adjusting confidence based on provenance trust scores computed via source reputation and metadata consistency checks. (4) User Interaction & Forensics Layer—provides a rich interactive dashboard visualizing calibrated confidence, provenance trails, and explanation overlays generated by the calibration module. Embedded digital forensic algorithms periodically analyze provenance patterns to detect anomalies such as source inconsistencies, repeated hallucinations, or suspicious advice clusters, generating real-time alerts for users and system administrators. The entire workflow runs in a pipelined manner enabling near real-time operation. We present detailed algorithmic formulations, including: (a) Confidence Recalibration Algorithm combining ontology logical consistency scores (C_ont) with provenance trust scores (C_prov) to produce a final calibrated confidence C_final = C_orig × (α·C_ont + β·C_prov), where α, β are tunable weights; (b) Provenance Hash Linkage Algorithm that constructs Merkle trees for metadata batches, anchoring them in blockchain blocks to ensure tamper-evident proofs; (c) Forensic Anomaly Detector employing statistical pattern recognition and rule-based heuristics on provenance timelines. The modular architecture and data flow diagrams are elaborated to clarify component interactions and extensibility.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop a comprehensive financial ontology incorporating regulatory, market, and investment concepts with formal constraints. 2) Curate a provenance-enriched dataset simulating financial advice generation with rich metadata about trusted and untrusted sources. 3) Implement the confidence recalibration module integrating ontology-based logic inference and provenance trust scoring. 4) Develop the blockchain-backed provenance storage system using a Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain network detailing hash linking and query APIs. 5) Design and build the interactive user interface dashboard embedding calibrated confidence visualizations and provenance exploration features. 6) Develop digital forensic tools for automated anomaly detection and alerting. 7) Conduct extensive quantitative evaluation of calibration accuracy, hallucination reduction, and auditability compared to baseline LLM outputs and prior calibration methods. 8) Run user studies assessing trust, usability, and actionable insight provided by the interactive system with financial professionals and lay users. 9) Benchmark system latency to ensure near real-time responsiveness under realistic workloads.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: Input: 'Invest 30% in technology stocks with 90% confidence.' Ontology flags partial inconsistency since allocation summations violate portfolio constraints. Calibration module adjusts confidence down to 65%. Blockchain provenance reveals source data timestamps and source reputations. UI dashboard highlights recalibration causes with tooltip explanations and shows provenance trail. Forensic detector flags unusual repeated contradictory advice from source X, triggering alert. Example 2: Input: 'Diversify investments across sectors with 85% confidence.' Ontology confirms compliance with diversification constraints, and provenance indicates high-reputation source consistency. Final confidence remains high at 82%. UI interface shows strong trust indicators and provenance validation. Forensic tools report no anomalies.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time integration proves challenging due to computational or blockchain throughput constraints, we will implement an asynchronous batch recalibration and provenance anchoring pipeline. Confidence recalibration will leverage cached ontology-consistency scores and off-chain provenance indexes with cryptographic commitments to the blockchain, maintaining tamper-evidence while lowering latency. We will prioritize forensic detection in offline mode with user notification upon analysis completion, ensuring continued trust enhancements despite performance trade-offs."

        "title": "Investor Risk Perception Modeling using Explainable LLMs with Enhanced Green Innovation Indicators and Psychological Profiles",
        "Problem_Statement": "While financial advisory models have increasingly incorporated ESG factors, current large language models (LLMs) used for financial advice inadequately capture the nuanced, subjective sustainability preferences of individual investors, particularly their psychological risk aversion profiles linked to green innovation. Existing financial LLMs often unify ESG signals without deeply integrating green innovation indicators in a personalized, explainable manner that connects distinct investor psychologies—such as varying sustainability priorities and risk attitudes—to tailored risk assessments. This gap limits the trustworthiness and relevance of advice for investors whose decisions crucially depend on green innovation dynamics and nuanced personal preferences.",
        "Motivation": "This research aims to address the identified limitations through a novel fusion of behavioral financial economics and AI governance by embedding investor psychological profiles—explicitly encoding heterogeneous risk aversion and green priority dimensions—within an LLM framework augmented by comprehensive, temporally and sectorally granular green innovation indicators. While prior models incorporate ESG broadly, they generally lack rigor in explainable personalization grounded in explicit psychological modeling and transparent causal links to green innovation. By bridging these external gaps with an innovative multi-input architecture enhanced by generative adversarial network (GAN)-based data augmentation to overcome limited investor datasets, the research enhances personalization and trustworthiness of AI financial advice. Our approach distinctly advances beyond competitive baselines by offering interpretable causal explainability layers that trace investment recommendations directly to investor-specific sustainability considerations and evolving green innovation signals, thus catering to evolving, psychologically grounded investor needs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-input LLM architecture where investor profile embeddings explicitly capture validated financial behavioral constructs of risk aversion and sustainability preference, drawing on established psychological and behavioral finance literature (e.g., prospect theory, sustainability mindset frameworks). Investor profile embeddings are learned from comprehensive survey data and augmented using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate realistic synthetic profiles to mitigate sparse data challenges. Concurrently, high-resolution green innovation indicators—sourced from international databases with sectoral and temporal granularity (e.g., patent filings, green R&D expenditure from financial economics datasets)—are integrated as structured contextual features. The model is trained end-to-end to align investor profiles, green innovation data, and financial returns, using multi-objective loss functions balancing accuracy, trustworthiness, and explainability metrics. Explainability is achieved through added causal attention mechanisms that transparently highlight how green innovation signals influence risk perception conditioned on investor psychological embeddings. Additionally, an agent system simulates dynamic investor decision processes to further validate model robustness and practical financial task adaptability, bridging theoretical modeling and real-world application.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Data Collection: Assemble a representative dataset combining detailed investor risk profiles—collected via validated survey instruments including sustainability preference scales—and granular green innovation metrics with temporal and sectoral resolution from financial databases and international sources; 2) Data Augmentation: Employ GAN-based techniques to synthetically expand investor profile data, preserving realistic heterogeneity; 3) Model Development: Build the multi-input LLM with embedded behavioral finance-inspired investor profiles and green innovation features, incorporating causal attention explainability modules; 4) Training and Optimization: Use multi-objective losses targeting predictive accuracy, personalized trustworthiness (measured via model confidence and calibration), and explainability quality (quantified by attention interpretability metrics); 5) User Studies: Recruit a diverse participant pool stratified by sustainability engagement and investment experience, conduct within-subject evaluations comparing model-generated advice against leading generic ESG advisory baselines on relevance, accuracy, trust, and explanation clarity using quantitative scales and qualitative interviews; 6) Robustness and Fallback Integration: Implement unsupervised clustering and demographic proxy embeddings as fallback strategies for sparse input cases, formally evaluating performance degradation and utility trade-offs; 7) Comparative Benchmarking: Benchmark against state-of-the-art ESG-incorporating financial advisors using established performance metrics with hypothesized moderate but statistically significant gains in trust and explanatory power; 8) Agent System Simulation: Use the developed agent system to simulate longitudinal investor interactions with the model in dynamic financial task scenarios to test adaptability and integration feasibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: An investor profile reflecting high sustainability priority and moderate risk aversion is presented alongside up-to-date green innovation metrics highlighting emerging renewable energy technologies in specific sectors. Output: The model recommends investments predominantly in companies leading renewable tech innovation with transparent explanations tracing lower projected long-term risk to advances in green R&D and alignment with the investor's sustainability-driven risk tolerance. Comparative output from a baseline model neglecting personalized psychological embeddings is less tailored and offers generic ESG references without causal explanation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "To address potential scarcity of personalized investor profile data, we will implement fallback mechanisms: first, apply unsupervised clustering techniques on available behavioral and demographic attributes to infer investor types, producing semi-personalized embeddings reflecting grouped risk and sustainability preferences; second, use demographic proxy embeddings derived from publicly available socioeconomic data as coarse-personalization surrogates. We will integrate these fallbacks within the experimental pipeline to evaluate associated performance and explainability degradations quantitatively and ensure practical applicability across varied data availability scenarios without undermining core methodological validity."

        "Problem_Statement": "While financial large language models (LLMs) have advanced investment advisory capabilities, they rarely integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics effectively. The heterogeneity, noise, and asynchronous temporal dynamics between ESG data and traditional financial metrics challenge direct integration and risk degrading financial prediction quality or misleading outputs. Additionally, real-time ESG fact-checking relies on sustainability databases that vary in coverage, granularity, and reliability, which can limit trustworthiness. This proposal explicitly addresses the compatibility and alignment challenges inherent in fusing ESG and financial streams and rigorously assesses the assumptions about data quality and fact-checker feasibility within the constraints of enterprise risk management and the broader financial landscape.",
        "Motivation": "This work pioneers a rigorously validated framework that advances beyond naive ESG-financial data fusion by implementing dynamic alignment, filtering, and reconciliation mechanisms. By explicitly modeling data heterogeneity and temporal misalignment, and embedding well-grounded assumptions verified via pilot data analyses, this framework promises a more trustworthy and accurate investment advisory system. Incorporating concepts from enterprise risk management and business model innovation, it bridges financial and ESG domains comprehensively, positioning itself as a leading-edge model innovation addressing critical gaps overlooked by existing financial LLMs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular, multi-stage architecture integrating a traditional financial LLM stream with an ESG data processing stream through a temporally-aware cross-attention mechanism enhanced by gating modules that regulate ESG input influence dynamically based on signal quality and alignment confidence. Prior to fusion, dedicated preprocessing pipelines perform rigorous synchronization of datasets using timestamp alignment and noise filtering informed by robust statistical methods and domain expert heuristics. A specialized ESG fact-checking module leverages live sustainability databases benchmarked for coverage and reliability, incorporating an uncertainty quantification layer to flag unverifiable claims. The architecture incorporates an enterprise risk management framework to balance investment return accuracy against ESG risks, and draws on political economy insights to contextualize ESG impact within legal and regulatory systems. To further enhance model robustness and innovation, impact of digital transformation on data flows is modeled, and an adaptive model gating system is employed to optimize output trustworthiness and accuracy dynamically.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Source and curate distinct, high-quality datasets: financial data from established market databases; ESG data from multiple vetted sustainability repositories (e.g., CDP, SASB, and live ESG ratings providers), ensuring temporal and contextual alignment. Use interpolation and expert heuristics for synchronization. 2) Conduct pilot analyses quantifying ESG data sparsity, noise levels, and timing differences to validate assumptions underlying integration. 3) Train baseline traditional financial LLM and a series of ESG-augmented models with varying integration and gating strategies. 4) Evaluate models on: (a) financial return accuracy using established metrics such as Mean Absolute Error and Sharpe Ratio over benchmark portfolios; (b) ESG consistency using industry-standard ESG rating correlations and custom sustainability validation indices; (c) fact-checker precision and recall against curated ESG claims datasets, assessing uncertainty calibration. 5) Perform ablation studies to test robustness under degraded or sparse ESG data scenarios and assess computational overhead. 6) Design and conduct user studies with finance professionals (sample size ≥50) deploying validated survey instruments (e.g., trust scales) and behavioral analytics (decision impact assessments) to measure trust and decision improvement. 7) Incorporate human expert review for feedback and model refinement. 8) Iterate on model tuning and fallback mechanisms informed by empirical results for system optimization.",

Current solutions lack integrated, real-time intervention mechanisms and fail to consider critical infrastructure protection and rigorous stakeholder oversight, undermining trustworthiness and compliance.",

This approach advances ethical AI governance beyond static audits by enabling actionable, timely enforcement and transparent stakeholder engagement. By incorporating perspectives of customers and critical infrastructure protection principles, the framework sets a new standard for trustworthy, next-generation AI systems in sensitive financial environments.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular governance platform structured around a dynamic agent system that interconnects bias detection, privacy auditing, and blockchain-based immutable logging under a security-by-design approach. Specifically, bias detection modules continuously analyze advisory outputs for protected-attribute disparities using formalized ethical criteria operationalized with legal experts. When bias or privacy violations surpass predefined thresholds, autonomous ethical agent controllers trigger tiered interventions: initial automated mitigation (e.g., output adjustment or advisory suspension); escalation to human auditors through smart contract-enforced alerting; and mandatory review workflows presented on explainable dashboards for stakeholders, including customers and regulators. All detected incidents, interventions, and audit outcomes are immutably recorded on a blockchain ledger to ensure transparency and tamper-evidence, supporting external auditor oversight. Clear interfaces and message passing protocols between agents, blockchain smart contracts, and stakeholder dashboards are designed to ensure real-time responsiveness, enforceability, and system robustness under realistic financial advisory contexts. The system is architected with security-by-design principles to protect critical infrastructure and uphold data privacy throughout.",

This enables principled optimization under uncertainty and risk constraints reflecting factual correctness and downstream user trust. By integrating agent communication protocols and a robust reward model balancing factual accuracy with trust metrics across specialized verification agents, the approach advances novelty and scalability for dynamic financial LLM output validation, pushing beyond typical single-agent, flat verification systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hierarchical multi-agent system composed of specialized fact-checker agents operating at different verification levels—from surface text checks to deep semantic validation against financial databases. Each agent is meta-learned to adapt quickly to evolving financial data streams. The overall fact-checking adaptation is modeled as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) where the state encodes the current verification context and financial environment; actions correspond to verification strategies or inter-agent communication directives; and constraints enforce limits on risk (false positives/negatives) and latency. A reward model jointly optimizes factual accuracy and user trust outcomes captured via market reactions and regulatory feedback. Agents communicate using defined protocols enabling collaboration—sharing intermediate findings and uncertainty estimates to refine joint decisions. Reinforcement learning with CMDP solvers updates the meta-learners, integrating feedback loops that adapt policies considering multi-level verification signals and constraints. We will provide a schematic diagram and pseudocode outlining agent interactions, CMDP components, and learning update cycles to clarify the architecture and facilitate reproducibility.

Current approaches lack detailed, domain-aware verification mechanisms and adaptability to evolving user intents or regulatory shifts, limiting their effectiveness in high-stakes financial contexts.",
        "Motivation": "While multiple-agent frameworks and hybrid verification methods have been proposed for hallucination detection, most lack dynamic adaptability and precise, mechanistic explanation of disagreements among agents. Our work aims to fill this critical gap by designing a context-adaptive consensus system that tightly integrates domain-specific expert knowledge with state-of-the-art explainable AI and intent-driven orchestration. This approach introduces innovative mechanisms to dynamically reweight agent outputs and incorporate process mining insights, resulting in a novel, self-aware hallucination detection system advancing beyond static ensembles. This represents a substantial novelty and impact leap over current methods by enhancing robustness, compliance alignment, and trust in financial LLM deployment.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid multi-agent consensus framework with four principal components: (1) Multiple specialized LLM agents independently generate financial advice outputs fine-tuned for subdomains such as equities, regulation, and macroeconomics.

(3) An intent-driven orchestration layer inspired by intent-based networking dynamically manages agent weighting and knowledge engine selection by continuously mining transaction logs and user interaction patterns (process mining). This layer adapts consensus criteria and agent prioritization to reflect evolving regulatory landscapes and user intents in real time. (4) A consensus algorithm aggregates agent outputs with a configurable agreement threshold and conflict resolution steps:  \n- **Consensus aggregation:** Compute a weighted vote where weights derive from historical agent reliability, intent-driven prioritization, and knowledge engine feedback.\n- **Conflict resolution:** Outputs failing consensus trigger explainable AI modules that produce fine-grained attribution maps pinpointing hallucinated phrases or entities, leveraging attention and counterfactual analysis.\n- **Adaptive retraining loop:** Detected hallucinations feed into a synthetic data generation pipeline augmenting rare and edge financial cases, strengthening retraining datasets to improve future accuracy.\n\nPseudocode outlines:  \n\n```\nfor each input_query:\n    agent_outputs = [LLM_agent_i(input_query) for i in agents]\n    validation_scores = [knowledge_engine.validate(o) for o in agent_outputs]\n    intent_weights = orchestration_layer.compute_weights(current_intent, validation_scores)\n    consensus_score, consensus_output = aggregate(agent_outputs, intent_weights, threshold=theta)\n    if consensus_score < theta:\n        hallucination_map = explainable_AI.analyze_conflicts(agent_outputs)\n        trigger_adaptive_retraining(hallucination_map, input_query)\n    return consensus_output, hallucination_map\n```\n\nThis design operationalizes consensus with detailed conflict adjudication under realistic regulatory semantics, ensuring transparency and regulatory compliance crucial in financial settings.",

Personalization layers are fine-tuned per institution by embedding these knowledge graph representations into the LLM's intermediate layers using graph neural networks. This approach explicitly incorporates domain expertise, enabling tailored model adaptations without raw data exposure.\n\n2. **Differential Privacy with Synthetic Data Augmentation:** To further enhance privacy and reduce heterogeneity, each institution employs generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create high-fidelity, differentially private synthetic financial text data.

        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) used in financial advisory systems for elderly or home-based clients often hallucinate or generate misinformation due to their lack of integration with real-world, context-sensitive data such as real-time social engagement, health status, and home service utilization. Moreover, existing systems often fail to address the privacy, ethical, and security challenges inherent in streaming sensitive, multimodal home care data, which limits adoption and trustworthiness for vulnerable populations. This leads to unreliable advice that may have serious adverse effects on elderly clients' wellbeing and financial decisions.",
        "Motivation": "Building on the recognized gap in integrating dynamic, real-time contextual data into LLM advisory outputs, our approach emphasizes a privacy-preserving, ambient intelligence-enabled framework that non-intrusively captures comprehensive home care metrics in elderly populations. Existing LLM advisory systems mostly operate in data silos, without robust privacy safeguards or real-time adaptivity to context fluctuations, limiting reliability and transparency. By embedding advanced application security measures (e.g., encrypted data pipelines, differential privacy, and secure multiparty computation), natural language processing explainability modules, and longitudinal data analytics, our system not only reduces hallucination rates but creates a trustworthy, secure, and ethically compliant advisory platform. Such integration, combined with collaboration with geriatric research centers like the University Clinics of Kinshasa, leverages domain expertise and cross-contextual applicability, fundamentally advancing beyond current competitive solutions towards scalable, user-trusted deployments in decentralized elderly care settings.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel integrative AI framework that harnesses privacy-preserving ambient intelligence to unobtrusively and securely collect multimodal streaming home care data—including IoT sensor activity, social interaction proxies, and financial transaction records—from elderly clients. The system incorporates cutting-edge application security techniques: encrypted data pipelines, differential privacy to protect individual data traces, and secure multiparty computation for collaborative model updates without revealing raw data. This data informs a multi-input dynamic context embedding layer tightly coupled with open-source LLMs fine-tuned for contextual financial advisory, ensuring outputs are grounded in up-to-date, user-specific states. A continuous feedback loop with adaptive embedding recalibration maintains model robustness over time. Integrated natural language processing modules provide uncertainty quantification and transparent explanation generation that visually links recommendations to relevant embedded context, promoting user trust. Longitudinal data analytics monitor trend changes to proactively tailor advice. We plan sustained collaboration with the University Clinics of Kinshasa to pilot our system, validating cultural and clinical relevance. The system architecture explicitly supports fallback modes, resorting to simulated datasets or caregiver-reported updates if real-time data streams degrade, with symbolic verification layers as an additional guardrail against hallucinations, thereby ensuring continuous safety and reliability in real-world deployments.",

This risk is amplified for elderly and vulnerable populations who rely on such advice for critical financial decisions, potentially leading to harmful outcomes. Ensuring real-time, explainable verification of financial advice grounded in authentic, comprehensive data remains a key challenge.",

Although prior work explores integrating vision transformers and knowledge graphs, the mechanisms for tightly coupling multimodal verification with language generation remain underexplored and lack explainability, limiting practical trustworthiness and compliance in financial domains. Our approach innovates by designing a novel, explainable architecture combining vision transformers interpreting financial documents and dynamic, queryable knowledge graphs within a controlled, real-time fact-checking feedback loop that communicates uncertainty and discrepancies transparently. We further leverage synthetic dataset generation and multi-agent architectures for robust training and evaluation, addressing scalability and data privacy challenges. This distinguishes our work beyond component assembly by pioneering an interoperable, feedback-driven verification framework suited for regulatory-sensitive financial advice, advancing trust and safety for vulnerable users.",

        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. **Financial Knowledge Graph Construction and Validation:**\n   - Integrate regulatory data, investment product details, and anonymized client metadata from approved, privacy-compliant APIs.\n   - Define KG completeness and quality metrics using ontology coverage scores and expert validation.\n   - Perform stress tests introducing synthetic adversarial updates to assess robustness.\n\n2. **Dataset Acquisition and Synthetic Data Generation:**\n   - Collect limited-scale anonymized multimodal datasets: financial PDFs, scanned records paired with advisory dialogues.\n   - Develop a synthetic data generation pipeline simulating diversified financial documents and corresponding advisory conversations, leveraging advanced generative models to expand training data while ensuring privacy.\n\n3. **Vision Transformer Training and Alignment:**\n   - Pretrain ViT on synthetic and real datasets.\n   - Fine-tune with multi-task objectives for semantic embedding accuracy and OCR fallback detection.\n\n4. **Multi-Agent Fusion and Verification Module Development:**\n   - Implement the multi-agent architecture coordinating LLM output, ViT embeddings, and KG queries with cross-modal attention.\n   - Apply gating mechanisms for real-time factuality feedback within decoding.\n\n5. **Ablation Studies and Benchmarking:**\n   - Isolate contributions of ViT, KG, and feedback loops using factual accuracy, citation precision, and hallucination metrics.\n   - Benchmark against standard LLM financial advisors on these metrics.\n\n6. **User Studies with Elderly Cohorts:**\n   - Recruit participants meeting defined demographic criteria with ethical oversight.\n   - Employ rigorous evaluation protocols measuring trust via validated scales (e.g., Trust in Automation Scale), reliance metrics, and decision outcome safety.\n   - Employ between-subject designs comparing fact-checked versus conventional advice.\n\n7. **Latency and Fallback Evaluation:**\n   - Measure system responsiveness under real-time constraints.\n   - Validate fallback mechanisms’ effectiveness via controlled failure injection.\n\n8. **Explainability and Compliance Assessment:**\n   - Conduct expert reviews on transparency and audit trails.\n\nThis comprehensive plan ensures reproducibility, domain relevance, and practical usability of the approach.",

        "Motivation": "While existing AI fairness assessments largely rely on quantitative statistical measures, such approaches overlook nuanced cultural and ethical dimensions integral to clinical communication. This research uniquely integrates rigorous theatrical narrative frameworks with advanced computational models—such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for narrative structure parsing and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for linguistic feature extraction—to operationalize narrative ethics in fairness auditing. By bridging humanities-informed narrative analysis with state-of-the-art AI, this toolkit advances beyond metaphoric use of theatrical concepts towards an interpretable, reproducible, and clinically relevant bias detection methodology, enhancing trustworthiness and acceptance in healthcare AI systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "The toolkit operationalizes theatrical narrative concepts through a multi-stage computational pipeline. First, clinical text outputs from LLMs, such as patient discharge summaries and clinical dialogues, are preprocessed and transformed into intermediate narrative representations using RNN-based sequence encoders trained on annotated healthcare narratives.

Character motivation and moral tension indicators are modeled via attention mechanisms trained on ethically annotated corpora, enabling the identification of bias triggers expressed through stigmatizing language or implicit blame structures. These structured narrative features feed into a custom bias detection module that employs both rule-based heuristics derived from established theatrical dramaturgy principles and machine learning classifiers optimized for cultural sensitivity. Finally, the system generates actionable recommendations by mapping detected biases to phrasing alternatives informed by adaptive learning systems prioritizing minimized cognitive load and improved communication efficacy in clinical decision support contexts.

Measure alignment with standard fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds, and collect data on divergence to inform model adjustment. 5) Final Validation: Conduct a controlled study comparing toolkit outputs with clinician cultural competency assessments and existing fairness auditing tools, assessing improvements in bias detection accuracy and clinical communication effectiveness.",

By integrating personalized federated learning concepts and smart communication strategies, this approach advances beyond existing models by dynamically mitigating bias and adversarial risks at client-level granularity, enhancing trustworthiness and applicability in AI-enabled e-health systems.",

For each modality, we construct personalized behavior baselines using moving-window exponential smoothing and kernel density estimations to model normal representation distributions.\n\n2) **IDS-Inspired Anomaly Scoring:** Leveraging statistical anomaly detection principles from IDS, we compute local anomaly scores by measuring Mahalanobis distance and cosine similarity deviations of new latent samples relative to client-specific behavior baselines. These scores quantify deviations potentially caused by bias, adversarial perturbations, or corrupted data.\n\n3) **Federated Secure Aggregation of Anomaly and Gradient Updates:** Anomaly scores and model gradients are securely aggregated at the server using cryptographic aggregation protocols preserving data privacy. This aggregation enables global detection of anomalous client contributions without exposing raw data.\n\n4) **Dynamic Fairness-aware Reweighting Algorithm:** The server employs a theoretically justified reweighting scheme where client model updates are weighted inversely proportional to their aggregated anomaly scores, adjusted by fairness constraints targeting demographic parity metrics. This ensures model updates promoting equitable performance across patient subgroups.\n\n5) **Personalized Federated Learning and Communication Optimization:** To address client heterogeneity and computational overhead, clients maintain personalized model components adapting to local distributions, communicated in optimized rounds that balance quality-of-service and communication costs.\n\n6) **Interpretability and Explanation Integration:** We use SHAP values on federated model predictions to generate interpretable explanations at client and server levels, linking anomaly detection outputs to clinical features, thus not compromising model interpretability.\n\nAlgorithmic pseudo-code and formal proofs of convergence and fairness guarantees under secure aggregation and anomaly reweighting are provided to substantiate soundness and practical trade-offs.\n\nThis integrative approach exploits the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity strategies to achieve robust, fair, and privacy-preserving AI-CDSS deployment in distributed healthcare environments.",

They lack comprehensive integration of heterogeneous data sources—including text, audio, and visual cues—and fail to leverage temporal interaction context and decentralized data distribution. These limitations reduce robustness and scalability when detecting subtle adversarial patterns across diverse interaction channels, hindering deployment in privacy-sensitive, distributed environments such as Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and cyber-physical systems.",

By designing a principled fusion mechanism combining textual, vocal emotion, and visual cues with interaction provenance, and incorporating temporally-aware models, we can capture nuanced adversarial signals beyond text alone. Furthermore, integrating federated learning over distributed customer endpoints addresses data sparsity and privacy challenges, enabling scalable and robust deployment.

The joint embedding space is learned with contrastive loss designed to maximize sensitivity to adversarial discrepancies across modes. (2) Federated Learning Paradigm: Deploy the model in a federated learning setup wherein edge devices hosting customer interactions locally train modality-specific encoders and share encrypted embeddings/gradients with a central server for global model aggregation, ensuring data privacy and overcoming heterogeneity/sparsity of multi-modal data. (3) Vision-Language Integration: Incorporate vision-language models pre-trained on joint text-video datasets as a backbone to enrich visual and textual semantic alignment enhancing detection of subtle, context-dependent adversarial manipulations. (4) Adaptive Recovery Module: Conditioned on multimodal embedding uncertainty and adversarial detection confidence, dynamic recovery strategies activate varying levels of interaction fallback, clarification requests, or escalation, improving downstream user engagement retention.

It produces formal logical proofs retrievable as human-readable reasoning chains. The neural LLM module handles user input encoding, dialogue state tracking, and natural language generation for recovery dialogues. Communication is enabled via a neural-symbolic coupling layer: (1) The neural module proposes candidate dialogue states and recovery intents, (2) the symbolic module verifies these candidates against symbolic rules, computes confidence scores, and generates logical proof paths, and (3) feedback from symbolic verification modulates the neural module’s generation distribution via a learned gating mechanism. The entire pipeline is trained on annotated adversarial recovery dialogues with reinforcement learning (RL) rewards based on symbolic proof confidence and dialogue success, integrating advanced information systems engineering principles to ensure modularity and extensibility. Logical proofs generated on-the-fly are utilized both as explicit explanations to users (boosting transparency and trust) and as constraints to guide neural generation away from unsafe or inconsistent recovery actions, enhancing robustness to adversarial inputs.

Temporal features are encoded via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture time-series dynamics.\n\n2. **Causal Inference Module:** We employ Judea Pearl's Structural Causal Models (SCMs) combined with do-calculus for causal discovery of failure modes. This involves constructing directed acyclic graphs representing agent-environment interactions to identify cause-effect pathways for failures.\n\n3. **Federated Explainable AI Training:** Using a federated learning framework (e.g., FedAvg), decentralized customer service platforms collaboratively train explainable models such as causal decision trees and graph neural networks. Privacy-preserving protocols ensure no raw data leaves local clients, addressing heterogeneity and scalability.\n\n4. **Resilience Metrics Computation:** We formalize resilience using engineering metrics like Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR), Fault Tolerance Index (FTI), and system robustness scores.

        "Problem_Statement": "Reinforcement learning agents applied in customer service settings often operate as opaque decision-makers, lacking transparent, multimodal explanations of their behavior especially under adversarial conditions. This opacity impedes user trust, hinders real-time adaptation, and limits recovery from security threats within dynamic, linguistically complex dialogue systems. Additionally, current frameworks inadequately integrate adaptive security policies informed by interpretable diagnostics, restricting their practical deployment in environments demanding both explainability and rapid, autonomous security response.",
        "Motivation": "While explainable AI and reinforcement learning have seen significant advances, their integration remains predominantly unimodal and limited in handling adversarial dialogues with dynamic security adaptation. To overcome the novelty and competitiveness gaps, this research aims to fuse state-of-the-art vision-language models and deep reinforcement learning with uncertainty estimation for a multimodal explanation paradigm that goes beyond textual rationales to include visual attention and risk awareness. By embedding these explanations into real-time adaptive security policy updates—including network-level access control and encryption adjustments—this approach sets a new frontier in trustworthy autonomous agents. The combination of dynamic, explanation-guided security adaptation with uncertainty-aware decision-making and multimodal interpretability establishes clear differentiation from existing work and broadens applicability to complex real-world customer service and networked agent domains, thus positioning the research at the intersection of explainability, robustness, and security management for the B5G era and beyond.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework enhanced with multimodal explainability by leveraging pretrained vision-language models to produce combined textual and visual attention-based explanations for agent actions under adversarial dialogue inputs. Integrate deep uncertainty estimation techniques (e.g., Bayesian neural networks, ensemble methods) into the agent’s policy to quantify decision confidence and detect ambiguous or risky inputs. Design a dynamic security adaptation module that consumes real-time multimodal explanation feedback and uncertainty signals to automatically adjust layered security policies—ranging from authentication protocols and access control to encryption parameter tuning—in both dialogue-level and network-level contexts, including extension to multi-agent systems. To concretely ensure feasibility and deployment readiness, implement modular proof-of-concept stages: (1) isolated evaluation of explanation generation quality and counterfactual validity on adversarial dialogue datasets; (2) integration of uncertainty-aware decision monitoring; (3) closed-loop feedback mechanisms linking explanation outputs and uncertainty estimates directly into security policy parameter updates during training and inference; and (4) staged system-level validations under realistic operational constraints simulating customer service environments with adversarial inputs. Quantitative metrics explicitly defined at each stage include explanation fidelity (e.g., faithfulness, human interpretability), counterfactual plausibility, security policy effectiveness (e.g., reduction in false acceptances), uncertainty calibration (e.g., expected calibration error), and real-time throughput constraints. User studies with domain experts will iteratively validate the interpretability and trust gains prior to large-scale robustness benchmarking, enabling rapid iteration and minimizing deployment risks. This integrated methodology advances the state-of-the-art by synthesizing cutting-edge NLP, vision-language modeling, deep RL uncertainty, and network security paradigms into a comprehensive, adaptive, and interpretable system.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Preparation: Curate and preprocess adversarial and benign dialogue datasets including multi-turn session context and network-level metadata to support multimodal explanation and security evaluation.\n2) Explanation Module Evaluation: Develop and benchmark textual and visual (attention-based) explanation generation methods including counterfactual generation; assess explanation quality with quantitative proxies (faithfulness, plausibility, completeness) and qualitative user studies with security and dialogue domain experts.\n3) Uncertainty Estimation Integration: Implement Bayesian or ensemble RL models to generate calibrated uncertainty scores; validate uncertainty calibration and its correlation with adversarial input detection.\n4) Modular Feedback Loop Design: Engineer technical mechanisms to incorporate explanation outputs and uncertainty signals into adaptive security policy controllers at both agent inference and training phases, ensuring low-latency updates.\n5) Proof-of-Concept Milestones: Conduct isolated controlled experiments on explanation quality and uncertainty detection before integrating feedback loops; set incremental milestones with clear timeline and resource budgets.\n6) System-Level Validation: Simulate deployment scenarios with real-time adversarial dialogues, applying adaptive security policy updates; evaluate effectiveness via metrics including authentication error rates, attack detection rates, user trust surveys, and system latency measurements.\n7) Scalability and Extension Testing: Expand experiments to multi-agent setups and network-level security adaptations; benchmark improvements against non-adaptive baselines.\n8) Iterative Refinement: Use expert feedback and empirical results to refine models and feedback mechanisms throughout development stages.\nOverall, each step explicitly defines evaluation protocols, success criteria, and fallback thresholds to guarantee practical viability and reproducibility in operational customer service contexts.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: Input - An adversarial dialogue request that superficially passes basic authentication but contains latent session inconsistencies. Agent Output - Multimodal explanation combining textual rationale ('Request denied: authentication token mismatches earlier session context') and visual attention heatmaps highlighting suspicious tokens; uncertainty score flagged as high risk; adaptive security module responds by tightening access control parameters and triggering secondary verification.\nExample 2: Input - Ambiguous user input with conflicting intents under noisy channel conditions. Agent Output - Explanation reveals ambiguity via counterfactual examples; uncertainty estimation identifies low confidence; system initiates fallback dialogue policy and escalates security monitoring.\nExample 3: In a multi-agent network security context, an agent detects anomalous message patterns flagged by low-confidence decisions and explanation-guided diagnostics; security policies at network encryption and access levels dynamically adjust, reducing unauthorized access attempts.\nAcross examples, explanations build user trust via transparency, while adaptive policies minimize security breaches and maintain system robustness.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "In case integration of multimodal explanation and uncertainty mechanisms leads to unacceptable latency or RL performance degradation, fallback to modular architecture separating explanation generation as offline or asynchronous analyzers servicing the real-time agent queries. Explore simplified surrogate models for explanations focusing on core features with faster inference. Evaluate hybrid approaches combining uncertainty estimation with rule-based anomaly detection for lightweight alerting. If adaptation feedback loops prove challenging to deploy real-time, implement staged policy updates during maintenance windows or throttled operational modes. Additionally, resource allocation and timeline flexibility in milestones allow reverting to pre-deployment incremental prototyping emphasizing either interpretability or security adaptation individually, preserving core research contributions while mitigating risk and optimizing system complexity for practical customer service deployment."

Each agent maintains a local symbolic reasoning module that monitors agent experiences and adversarial feedback streams, invoking symbolic reasoning at defined intervals (e.g., after fixed interaction epochs or detection of anomalies). The core mechanism includes a detailed protocol: (1) RL agents generate candidate policies through continuous exploration and exploitation; (2) symbolic modules perform consistency checks against security rules and diagnose anomalies; (3) discrepancies between learned policies and symbolic constraints trigger a conflict resolution algorithm leveraging prioritized rule hierarchies and policy adjustment via constrained optimization; (4) symbolic rules adapt through an experience-based update function—guided by predefined heuristics and adversarial feedback clustering—that selectively expands or refines rules to capture novel threat patterns; (5) intra-agent communication channels enable real-time sensor fusion of adversarial indicators and joint reasoning across agents, supporting cooperative resilience strategies; (6) RL policy optimization is constrained and informed by updated symbolic knowledge, fostering interpretable and verifiable policy adjustments; (7) the full system dynamics embrace adversarial machine learning techniques to simulate coordinated attacks and defenses in a multi-agent telecommunication environment.

The visual encoder utilizes a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) extracting multi-scale image features representing fine-grained to global figure semantics.\n\n2) **Explicit Multi-Scale Fusion via Learned Fusion Tokens:** We introduce learned fusion tokens at distinct semantic levels that mediate cross-modal alignment. These tokens are dynamically updated via cross-modal attention layers operating between span tokens and pyramid-level visual features. Fusion tokens leverage adaptive sparse attention masks generated following a relevance scoring function computed from modality-specific token contexts, enforcing focused computational pathways and reducing overhead. Mathematically, fusion tokens \u00039F_i\u00039 at scale i are updated as:\n\n\u00039F_i = Attention_{cross}(\u00039F_i, TextSpanTokens_i, VisualFeatTokens_i)\n\nSparse masks M_i are generated by thresholding normalized dot-product similarity matrices between token embeddings, dynamically pruning low-relevance attention connections.\n\n3) **Graph-Attentive Reasoning and Prompt Learning for Downstream Tasks:** Extracted entities and figure elements are represented as nodes in a heterogeneous graph structure enriched with edges derived from spatial and semantic proximity. A graph attention network (GAT) operates on this graph, enabling reasoning over multi-scale cross-modal entities. Furthermore, prompt learning modules tailored for scientific text-image fusion guide transformer fine-tuning for complex tasks like cross-modal retrieval and scientific question answering (leveraging Med-VQA datasets as exemplars).\n\nIllustrative architectural diagrams, detailed pseudocode for fusion token updates, mask generation, and graph construction components are provided to ensure method clarity and reproducibility.

        "Problem_Statement": "Scientific literature mining models often face significant challenges due to domain overfitting and poor generalization when integrating heterogeneous textual and visual scientific data across diverse disciplines. Furthermore, current contrastive pretraining frameworks tend to overlook leveraging rich natural language descriptions and the potential of joint embeddings to support intelligent decision-making, limiting their effectiveness and broader impact.",
        "Motivation": "Despite advances in vision-language representation learning, existing methods for scientific multi-modal understanding are limited by insufficient architectural specificity around domain heterogeneity handling and by narrow application scopes focused primarily on retrieval. Addressing these gaps, our approach introduces a rigorously designed, asymmetric multi-domain contrastive pretraining framework explicitly optimized to reconcile modality and domain discrepancies, enabling zero-shot cross-domain transfer. Additionally, by integrating expansive natural language descriptions—including abstracts, explanations, and metadata—and embedding an intelligent decision-making module, we aim to elevate the framework beyond representation learning to a practical multi-disciplinary scientific knowledge integration platform that actively supports hypothesis generation and experimental planning. This multi-faceted innovation expands methodological novelty and amplifies real-world societal impact.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Our framework consists of three core innovations: 1) **Asymmetric Multi-Domain Encoders with Cross-Domain Projection Heads:** For text, we employ a transformer-based encoder pre-trained on large scientific corpora, extended to process rich natural language descriptions beyond captions (including abstracts and explanations). For visual input (figures, diagrams), we use a CNN backbone customized with domain-adaptive batch normalization layers that calibrate feature distributions per scientific field (e.g., biology vs. physics), mitigating domain shift in visual modality. We then apply separate domain-specific projection heads that map each modality and domain to a unified embedding space. These heads are parameterized to explicitly minimize a domain discrepancy loss based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), ensuring alignment despite modality heterogeneity and domain discrepancies. \n\n2) **Contrastive Pretraining Objective with Curriculum and Regularization:** Training jointly optimizes an InfoNCE contrastive loss between paired text-visual embeddings, augmented with a modality- and domain-adaptive temperature parameter learned per batch. To prevent mode collapse and representational bias, we integrate a diversity-aware regularization term promoting uniform embedding utilization and introduce a curriculum learning schedule that incrementally incorporates more challenging, less represented domains, starting from single-domain to full multi-domain joint training.\n\n3) **Intelligent Decision-Making Module:** Leveraging the learned joint embeddings, we design an auxiliary graph neural network-based module that models inter-concept relationships across modalities and domains. This module supports downstream intelligent decision-making tasks such as automated hypothesis generation and experimental suggestion by reasoning over the aligned multi-modal scientific knowledge graph. By combining embeddings with rich metadata and natural language explanations, the system facilitates cross-disciplinary knowledge integration and actionable scientific insights.\n\nComprehensive training dynamics are monitored via correlation metrics, modality alignment scores, and environmental footprint estimates to ensure model robustness, interpretability, and sustainability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect and curate a comprehensive multi-domain paired dataset comprising scientific texts with rich descriptions (captions, abstracts, explanations, metadata) and corresponding visual elements (figures, diagrams) across disciplines such as biology, physics, and computer science.\n2) Implement and pretrain the asymmetric encoders with domain-adaptive normalization layers and projection heads on the collected dataset using the proposed contrastive loss combined with MMD domain discrepancy regularization and curriculum learning.\n3) Develop and integrate the intelligent decision-making graph neural network module leveraging the learned embeddings.\n4) Fine-tune the full framework on downstream tasks including cross-modal retrieval, entity tagging, relationship extraction, hypothesis generation, and experiment planning in underrepresented scientific domains.\n5) Evaluate performance against domain-specific unimodal and multimodal baselines using standard retrieval and classification metrics, plus human expert evaluation on decision-making outputs.\n6) Analyze environmental impact by comparing training efficiency and carbon footprint against baseline approaches, validating sustainability claims.\n7) Ablate components such as domain-adaptive normalization, curriculum learning, and the decision-making module to quantify their individual contributions.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Query text containing 'activation energy diagrams' along with figure images extracted from chemistry and rare molecular biology papers. Expected Output: Accurate retrieval of semantically relevant figures together with linked textual explanations and metadata, including correct interpretation of rarely seen domain content. Additionally, for a user-provided experimental hypothesis, the decision-making module should generate plausible experiment planning suggestions informed by the learned multi-modal embeddings and cross-disciplinary knowledge graph, validated by expert review.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If training instability arises due to complex contrastive objectives or domain discrepancy losses, we will simplify the model by sequentially pretraining modality-specific encoders with supervised domain-adaptive fine-tuning before joint contrastive alignment. Should the intelligent decision-making module underperform, we will decouple it and instead provide a modular API to integrate with existing domain-specific expert systems. Additionally, if mode collapse or representational bias persists, we will experiment with alternative regularization techniques such as contrastive margin penalties or adversarial domain alignment to improve robustness."

SNN layers employ networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with membrane potential dynamics adapted for asynchronous processing.\n2. **Gradient Propagation & Training:** To overcome the non-differentiability of spikes, we implement surrogate gradient methods allowing backpropagation through SNN modules during cross-modal co-training. We combine supervised transformer gradient flows with unsupervised STDP within SNN components to improve adaptation and robustness.\n3. **Latency Synchronization:** By carefully designing buffering mechanisms and spike train temporal windows aligned with transformer output embeddings, we maintain synchronization without compromising event-driven computation benefits.\n4. **In-Memory Computing Realism:** We simulate resistive-switching RAM arrays to perform synaptic weighted summations physically within SNNs, drastically reducing data movement energy. The SNN parameters and weight updates respect hardware constraints (e.g., limited precision, variation), informed by state-of-the-art RRAM device models.\n5. **Graph Learning on Spiking Outputs:** Post-spiking activations are structured into graph representations encoding semantic relationships, processed by graph neural network layers to enhance relation extraction capabilities.\n\nThrough knowledge distillation from pre-trained language models and co-training with literature mining objectives (named entity recognition, relation extraction), the hybrid model balances language understanding quality and neuromorphic energy efficiency.

        "Problem_Statement": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit degraded accuracy and reliability when deployed across diverse legal domains due to semantic shifts in terminology, evolving case law, and jurisdiction-specific regulations. Existing adaptation approaches, primarily relying on static fine-tuning or zero-shot generalization, fail to robustly recalibrate under these dynamic domain shifts, leading to critical errors in legal document interpretation and reasoning.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work attempts to adapt LLMs to legal subdomains, the novelty and impact remain limited due to reliance on static fine-tuning or isolated calibration strategies. Our proposal aims to transcend these limitations by fusing deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based calibration with cutting-edge knowledge editing techniques and intelligent decision-making frameworks. This integrated approach enables dynamic, targeted incorporation of evolving legal knowledge and prioritizes critical reasoning inconsistencies flagged during calibration, thereby enhancing adaptation efficiency, explainability, and robustness across jurisdictions. This synergy addresses the identified insufficiencies in prior domain adaptation methods, promising a more autonomous, scalable, and domain-aware legal LLM adaptation paradigm.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel hybrid architecture that tightly integrates three components: 1) A DRL calibration agent interacting with a dynamically updated, structured legal knowledge graph (KG) encapsulating jurisdiction-specific semantics, 2) A targeted knowledge editing module enabling efficient, localized updates to LLM internal representations without full retraining, and 3) An intelligent decision-making layer that prioritizes calibration feedback and flags critical inconsistencies for expert review or autonomous correction. \n\nThe DRL agent operates in discrete episodes, taking as state the current LLM output embeddings, knowledge graph validation signals, and uncertainty estimates. Actions include fine-grained adjustments via the knowledge editing module—such as localized weight modification or prompt embedding updates—and policy-driven triggering of recalibration routines. The reward function quantitatively integrates multiple feedback signals: factual accuracy against KG-derived ground truths using symbolic queries, semantic alignment via embedding similarity metrics, and procedural compliance measured with rule-based verification scripts. This combined reward guides policy learning using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for stable updates.\n\nKnowledge editing exploits recent parameter-efficient methods allowing direct, interpretable edits to legal knowledge representations inside the LLM, facilitating rapid adaptation to evolving statutes or case law without retraining.\n\nAn explicit, formalized feedback aggregation module computes each signal's quantitative value per iteration, ensuring transparency and reproducibility. Algorithmic pseudocode and architectural diagrams are provided to delineate component interactions and the precise mechanism by which calibration policies influence both direct LLM weight edits and auxiliary embedding modifications.\n\nTo validate mechanism efficacy, we design ablation studies isolating DRL calibration, knowledge editing, and decision-making contributions, with thresholds defined to detect domain shift scenarios prompting recalibration automatically, thus improving system stability and interpretability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate and validate diverse legal datasets spanning multiple jurisdictions (e.g., New York, California, federal), and multiple document types (contracts, rulings, statutes), incorporating expert annotations for ground-truth validation signals.\n\n2. Construct and iteratively refine a structured legal knowledge graph encoding domain rules, terminologies, and jurisdiction-specific concepts, validating through expert review and automated consistency checks.\n\n3. Develop and validate the knowledge editing module independently by testing localized edits on LLM outputs for inserting or correcting legal facts without full retraining.\n\n4. Implement the DRL calibration agent with clear interfaces to the KG validator and knowledge editing module; incorporate reward shaping and constrained policy updates to mitigate instability and sample inefficiency.\n\n5. Integrate an intelligent decision-making framework to prioritize critical feedback signals, reducing expert annotation burden by focused review of flagged inconsistencies.\n\n6. Run stepwise evaluations starting with knowledge graph validation and knowledge editing efficacy, followed by DRL calibration agent performance on fixed LLMs, before full end-to-end joint training.\n\n7. Perform comprehensive evaluations against strong baselines (static fine-tuning, zero-shot LLMs, and non-DKL calibration) using metrics like semantic similarity, legal factual accuracy, calibration error, expert human ratings, and training stability indicators.\n\n8. Conduct ablation studies to isolate effects of DRL calibration, knowledge editing, and decision-making contributions.\n\n9. Define quantitative milestones (e.g., achieving >90% factual accuracy on validation sets) and stability criteria (e.g., reward convergence patterns) as triggers for fallback policy activation if needed.\n\n10. Monitor training dynamics using reward distributions, policy entropy, and knowledge edit impact metrics to ensure stable and efficient learning within realistic resource constraints.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A contractual clause from a New York state employment agreement referencing \"at-will\" employment rights.\n\nExpected output: A jurisdiction-aware, concise explanation accurately capturing the \"at-will\" doctrine, clearly differentiating its applicability from other states, with flagged uncertainty or recommendation for expert review if subtle semantic ambiguities arise.\n\nAdditionally, after a simulated legal code update, the knowledge editing module dynamically updates the LLM's internal representations so that subsequent queries reflect the revised doctrine without full retraining or performance degradation.\n\nThis test case demonstrates the integrated system's ability to combine semantic domain awareness, dynamic knowledge assimilation, and decision-aware calibration to produce precise, trustworthy legal analyses.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "To address potential DRL training instability or slow convergence, we plan explicit fallback triggers based on quantitative criteria such as plateaued reward improvement over defined epochs or excessive policy entropy increases.\n\nUpon triggering, the system will revert to semi-supervised domain adaptation using self-training with pseudo-labeled legal documents, leveraging static knowledge graph validations.\n\nExpert-in-the-loop feedback will be incrementally introduced to correct model outputs and enrich recalibration signals, guided by the intelligent decision-making layer prioritizing highest-impact inconsistencies.\n\nAdditionally, we will explore offline RL techniques and reward shaping to improve stability. Resource allocation will be adapted dynamically to focus on these fallback mechanisms, ensuring continued progress towards robust domain adaptation even in challenging training scenarios."

Example 2: Input - Legal document from a new jurisdiction with unknown term usages; entity recognition detects novel terms, triggers domain shift detection, and dynamically updates prompts with relevant jurisdiction-specific ontology fragments. Output - Maintained or improved task performance compared to static baselines and flagged areas needing ontology extension.

        "Problem_Statement": "Hallucination in legal text generation critically undermines reliability and trustworthiness in legal NLP applications. Current LLMs adapted for legal tasks frequently produce plausible but fabricated content, and existing reliability scoring methods from other domains lack direct validation or tailored adaptation strategies for legal text. This gap leads to insufficient mitigation of hallucinated outputs in sensitive legal contexts.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work has explored reliability scoring in biomedical text generation, the domain differences between biomedical and legal texts—in terminology, logical structure, and domain-specific consistency criteria—pose significant adaptation challenges. Our approach innovates by rigorously validating domain transfer, grounding scoring mechanisms in comprehensive expert-annotated legal hallucination data, and integrating intelligent decision-making principles from healthcare critical care NLP. This multidisciplinary strategy advances beyond simplistic adaptation by explicitly addressing domain gaps, thereby strengthening hallucination mitigation's trustworthiness in legal AI systems. This contribution is critical for fulfilling real-time, high-stakes legal NLP demands where inference latency constraints and precise factuality are paramount.",

Preliminary Domain Transfer Validation & Data Collection: Conduct a domain similarity analysis between biomedical and legal texts focusing on terminology, logical discourse patterns, and hallucination taxonomy.

        "Problem_Statement": "Legal data is inherently sensitive, distributed across diverse institutions, and composed of heterogeneous modalities—including text and scanned document images. These variations, together with strict privacy and regulatory constraints, create significant barriers to centralized model training, impeding robust cross-institutional legal analysis and the development of domain-adaptive legal AI systems.",
        "Motivation": "Existing federated learning (FL) frameworks for legal AI lack explicit and effective mechanisms for multimodal integration across decentralized data silos. Prior approaches neglect the complex domain shifts and heterogeneous data distributions found in cross-institutional legal settings, and often omit privacy-guaranteeing semantic alignment across modalities. This work uniquely advances the state-of-the-art by proposing a structured modality fusion scheme within FL, combined with ontology-anchored consistency and adaptive domain personalization layers. Incorporating synthetic data generation techniques inspired by variational autoencoders enhances local data representativeness and aids domain adaptation. This architecture not only preserves privacy via rigorous protocols but also achieves superior cross-domain generalization, addressing the NOV-COMPETITIVE challenge through novel mechanism-level innovations for federated multimodal legal analysis.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a federated learning system integrating a hierarchical modality fusion architecture facilitating local joint representation learning for text and document images. Specifically:\n\n1. **Local Modality Encoders**: Each client employs modality-specific encoders—a pretrained Transformer-based text encoder and a CNN-Transformer hybrid for document images. Outputs feed into a modality fusion module implemented as a cross-modal attention transformer that learns inter-modality correlations locally.\n\n2. **Federated Parameter Partitioning and Update**: Parameters are partitioned into shared foundation model weights, domain-adaptive personalization layers, and modality fusion modules. Shared weights are globally aggregated using secure federated averaging with differential privacy guarantees. Domain-adaptive layers are personalized and updated locally based on a meta-learning scheme, allowing clients' models to adapt to domain shifts without sharing raw data.\n\n3. **Ontology-Informed Consistency Loss**: To ensure semantic alignment across clients, an ontology-informed consistency loss is operationalized via a decentralized protocol. Clients encode outputs into ontology embedding spaces and exchange encrypted similarity statistics using secure multiparty computation, enforcing consensus on semantically aligned features without exposing sensitive data.\n\n4. **Synthetic Data Augmentation via Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: Locally trained VAEs generate privacy-preserving synthetic samples supporting domain adaptation and mitigating data imbalance.\n\nAn architectural diagram and algorithmic pseudocode accompany this method, detailing modality fusion, parameter communication, and consistency enforcement steps, thereby enhancing reproducibility and practical implementability within privacy-preserving FL frameworks.",

Conduct pilot federated learning rounds across 3 clients before scaling to additional participants.\n\n4. **Federated Training Protocol**: Initiate federated fine-tuning of the multimodal foundation model with domain-adaptive personalization layers and integrate synthetic data from VAEs for augmentation.\n\n5. **Privacy and Communication Efficiency Metrics**: Measure privacy leakage through membership inference attacks and differential privacy budgets. Evaluate communication overhead using model update size, frequency, and compression techniques (e.g., quantization).\n\n6. **Evaluation Milestones**: Assess task performance on cross-institutional legal NLP and vision tasks—information retrieval, clause extraction, and semantic classification—benchmarking against centralized baselines.\n\n7. **Risk Assessment and Resource Planning**: Monitor stability of federated cycles; optimize computational resource allocation (estimated GPU hours and annotation effort). Develop mitigation protocols (disconnect recovery, fallback triggers) and perform regular audits.\n\n8. **Fallback Criteria**: Define quantitative thresholds on training instability (e.g., loss divergence), privacy budget exhaustion, and communication bottlenecks to trigger fallback strategies involving secure multi-party computation or modality-specific encoders.",

Alternatively, deploy modality-specific encoders operating independently rather than fused joint representations, reducing complexity while retaining multimodal capabilities. Synthetic federated datasets generated from VAEs or GANs will also be used to simulate federated conditions and enable robust domain adaptation in controlled centralized setups. Evaluation of fallback effectiveness will include accuracy, privacy, and communication trade-offs to inform dynamic method selection."
