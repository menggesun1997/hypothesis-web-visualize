        "Problem_Statement": "Current federated learning approaches for multimodal medical data struggle with communication overhead, domain heterogeneity, and lack of seamless integration into AI tool pipelines, hindering replicable LLM performance under resource constraints.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the external gap linking 'heterogeneous medical data' with 'compression approaches' and bridges it to 'AI tools' by pioneering federated learning protocols that compress both model parameters and metadata representations while preserving privacy. It uniquely tackles communication costs and domain gaps simultaneously in cloud-native multimodal environments.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a federated learning framework where each client performs aggressive multimodal-aware neural compression on local transformer layers and metadata embeddings using learned quantization and pruning. A novel metadata synthesizer generates compact, anonymized domain descriptors to guide aggregation. Adaptive communication protocols leverage compressed metadata to selectively update global LLM parameters, balancing computation and replication fidelity.
