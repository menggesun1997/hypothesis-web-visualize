    "title": "Ontology-Enriched LLM for Dynamic Eligibility Criteria Interpretation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Inconsistent interpretations of complex eligibility criteria reduce replicability and generalizability of LLM performance across clinical NLP benchmarks.",
    "Motivation": "Targets internal interpretability gaps and builds on the hidden bridge linking ontology-based clinical knowledge with LLM technical advances to augment model reasoning about eligibility criteria dynamically.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Augment LLMs with domain ontologies representing medical concepts, relationships, and eligibility constraints. Implement a hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning framework to interpret, normalize, and adapt eligibility criteria across varying clinical contexts to improve replicability of NLP benchmark results.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Integrate major biomedical ontologies (e.g., SNOMED CT) into LLM architectures; 2) Fine-tune models on clinical trial eligibility text datasets; 3) Conduct reasoning tests on complex eligibility cases; 4) Evaluate replicability improvements on benchmark tasks with ontology-augmented vs vanilla models; 5) Analyze error cases and ontology coverage; 6) Iterate on ontology mappings and reasoning heuristics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Eligibility statement 'Patients with recent myocardial infarction within 6 months.' Output: LLM outputs normalized interpretation using ontology terms with temporal constraints explicitly represented, improving cohort selection accuracy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If ontology integration introduces complexity or overhead, fallback to embedding ontology-based features as soft constraints or use hybrid pipeline with rule-based filters."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section lacks clarity on how exactly the hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning framework will function within the LLM architecture. The paper should concretely specify the integration strategy—how ontological knowledge bases will interact dynamically with neural components to interpret and normalize eligibility criteria in varied contexts. Details on the reasoning heuristics, adaptability mechanisms, and conflict resolution between symbolic and neural outputs are needed to validate soundness and mechanistic viability of the approach, especially given the complexity of eligibility criteria semantics in clinical texts. Elucidating these points will strengthen the argument for this method’s effectiveness and interpretability enhancements beyond naïve ontology embedding or pure end-to-end learning approaches. This should be addressed first to establish the soundness of the approach's core mechanism and assumptions about model interpretability and reasoning advancements inherent in the hybrid framework, thereby supporting subsequent feasibility and impact claims. Target section: Proposed_Method."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict, the idea’s impact and novelty could be substantially enhanced by exploring integration with related globally linked concepts such as trustworthy machine learning and semantic interoperability. For example, the proposal can extend to dynamically auditing and explaining eligibility criteria interpretations to clinicians or trial designers, improving model transparency and clinical trustworthiness. Leveraging Web intelligence techniques or graph data management could enable richer representation and querying of eligibility constraints as interconnected knowledge graphs. Incorporating technology acceptance models could guide user-centric evaluations of the ontology-enriched LLM system in real-life clinical NLP deployments. This broader framing and integration with these concepts will boost both novelty and practical impact beyond benchmark replicability, positioning it as a more transformative tool for biomedical NLP practice. Addressing this suggestion can create high-leverage gains in the research’s relevance and system adoption potential. Target section: Overall conceptual framing and future work."
