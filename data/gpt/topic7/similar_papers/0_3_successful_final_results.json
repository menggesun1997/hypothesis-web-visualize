        "title": "Hybrid Human-AI Collaborative Framework for Curating Clinical Trial Queries with Explicit RLHF Mechanisms and Rigorous Evaluation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Automated clinical trial eligibility query generation methods often lack adaptability and nuanced contextual understanding, which hinder replicability and generalization of NLP model assessments across diverse and heterogeneous clinical datasets.",
        "Motivation": "To address intrinsic limitations and external gaps in current clinical NLP approaches, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that explicitly integrates expert feedback to iteratively enhance query generation. Our approach improves over prior work by formalizing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) mechanisms with systematic signal encoding, quality control, and update policies. This enables sustained refinement of eligibility queries aligned with complex clinical semantics, improving replicability and robustness of NLP evaluation. Moreover, inspired by natural language processing advances in suicide prevention—where sensitive domain-specific text modeling benefits from human expertise—our framework leverages domain-expert knowledge to curate precise and contextually aware queries for clinical trial cohorts, a key step toward more effective AI-assisted clinical research.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We develop a hybrid eligibility query curation framework composed of three core components: (1) An LLM-based query generator pretrained on diverse clinical trial datasets enriched with clinical ontologies; (2) An interactive expert annotation interface that captures not only edits but also the rationale metadata, enabling differentiated feedback types (validity corrections vs. subjective preferences); (3) A rigorously defined RLHF loop with formal feedback encoding, policy-gradient update algorithms, and a consensus-driven quality control module to reconcile inconsistencies from multiple experts. Specifically, human feedback is categorized into discrete signals: (a) query correctness labels, (b) edit distance vectors, and (c) textual rationale embeddings. These are integrated into a probabilistic reward model guiding policy optimization of the generator. The retraining frequency is scheduled biweekly with incremental fine-tuning using accumulated expert feedback to balance model stability and reactivity. Additionally, the system incorporates ontological constraints and curated domain knowledge in updates to reinforce clinically meaningful query semantics. Privacy-preserving protocols ensure safe handling of sensitive clinical data. To enhance applicability to sensitive health subdomains, the system prototype incorporates lessons from NLP frameworks in suicide prevention, adapting nuanced linguistic cues to clinical trial query formulation. This sophisticated hybrid structure addresses existing novelty and reproducibility challenges by tightly coupling human insight with transparent and methodical reinforcement mechanisms.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Selection: Curate a heterogeneous corpus of 500+ diverse clinical trials spanning multiple diseases, including varied eligibility complexity, with special subsets in sensitive domains like hypertension and mental health (e.g., suicide prevention-related trials). Data governance ensures de-identification and compliance with ethical standards. 2) Baseline Model Training: Train an initial LLM-based query generator fine-tuned on annotated eligibility criteria across these datasets. 3) Expert Annotation Interface Development: Build a user-friendly platform capturing edits, rationale metadata, and feedback confidence scores from 20 domain experts. 4) Formal RLHF Loop Implementation: Define reinforcement signals with a probabilistic reward model incorporating edit correctness, rationale consistency, and agreement metrics. Schedule biweekly policy-gradient updates with rigorous logging and version control. 5) Evaluation Metrics: Quantitatively measure replicability improvements using Jaccard similarity, F1 score of query agreement across datasets, and statistical significance testing (e.g., paired Wilcoxon tests). User satisfaction and efficiency assessed via standardized system usability scales, time-to-task completion, and post-study Likert questionnaires. 6) Ethical and Privacy Assessment: Conduct formal review and implement differential privacy techniques where applicable. 7) Fallback Integration: If RLHF convergence delays occur, bootstrap the model using semi-supervised learning with expanded annotated corpora and reinforce ontological constraints with explicit rule-based modules before resuming RLHF cycles.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Eligibility criterion 'Adult patients with uncontrolled hypertension.' Initial LLM Output: Multiple candidate queries including 'age >18 AND hypertension uncontrolled', 'patients over 18 with poorly managed blood pressure', and exclusion rules for confounding medications. Expert Feedback: Edits correcting ambiguous terms, specifying exclusion of secondary hypertension, and providing rationale emphasizing pharmacological considerations. Encoded Signals: Query validity label = 1, edit distance vector quantifying changes, textual rationale embedding capturing expert explanations. Updated Model Response (post-RLHF update): Refined query integrating domain-specific constraints accurately reflecting the original eligibility while excluding irrelevant cohorts. This process is iterated over multiple criteria including suicide prevention risk assessments with sensitive linguistic nuances.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If RLHF training convergence is protracted or unstable, we will augment the system with a semi-supervised learning stage leveraging a significantly larger set of partially annotated eligibility criteria to pretrain query generation. Ontological constraints from clinical terminologies (e.g., SNOMED CT, MeSH) and rule-based filters will be embedded into the query selection process to impose domain-consistent corrections before RLHF refinement resumes. Continuous monitoring through ablation studies will evaluate the impact of these supplementary methods on final query quality and replicability gains."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an appealing hybrid approach combining LLM-generated candidate queries with human expert refinement and RLHF to improve query generation over time. However, the description lacks sufficient detail on how reinforcement signals will be operationalized and reliably captured from human feedback to guide model updates. It is unclear how the system will differentiate between expert edits that improve query validity versus those reflecting subjective preferences, as well as how it will handle inconsistencies in expert feedback. Clarifying the exact mechanisms of feedback encoding, model retraining frequency, and updating policies would strengthen confidence in the approach's soundness and reproducibility. Consider including formal definitions or algorithms for the RLHF loop and quality control procedures for human input integration within the Proposed_Method section. This will better ensure the system's learning process is well-founded and logically consistent with expert improvements in query curation, thus addressing potential pitfalls in model convergence and performance gains."

Key gaps include absence of explicit criteria for dataset selection and size (e.g., diversity of clinical trials and dataset heterogeneity), metrics for measuring replicability improvements (quantitative benchmarks or statistical tests), and specifics on how user satisfaction and efficiency will be quantitatively assessed (e.g., standardized surveys, time-to-completion measures). The plan also does not address potential ethical considerations or data privacy challenges common in clinical data use, which may impact feasibility. Further, the fallback plan's alternative approaches (semi-supervised learning, ontological constraints) need elaboration on integration with the main system and assessment methods. To improve, the authors should specify concrete measurable outcomes, validation protocols, data governance strategies, and timelines reflecting operational feasibility within realistic clinical NLP settings."
