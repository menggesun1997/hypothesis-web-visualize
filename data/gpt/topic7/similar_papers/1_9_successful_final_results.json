        "title": "Explainability-Driven Prompt Optimization for Replicable LLM Outputs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current prompt engineering practices prioritize performance metrics such as accuracy and fluency but often neglect explainability and replicability, which undermines user trust and the robustness required for production deployment. Without systematic methods to quantitatively integrate explainability feedback, prompt outputs remain inconsistent and their rationales obscure, limiting real-world reliability.",
        "Motivation": "While prompt engineering is established, leveraging explainability metrics to guide prompt generation is nascent. Our approach addresses the internal gap concerning the interplay between model complexity, user perceptions of uncertainty, and replicability by proposing an explainability-informed prompt optimization framework. This framework embeds quantitative explainability feedback—attention alignment and semantic provenance—as objective signals to improve output interpretability and stability, setting a novel standard for user-centric, replicable prompts beyond conventional accuracy-focused methods. This aligns with Opportunity 1 and introduces a fundamentally different mechanism integrating human-centered uncertainty perceptions and explainability into prompt design to surpass competitive baselines.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a mathematically grounded, iterative prompt optimization algorithm that integrates explainability feedback metrics as quantitative guidance within a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Specifically, at each iteration:\n\n1. The system generates prompt candidates.\n2. Each prompt is evaluated on: (a) task accuracy, (b) replicability under defined input perturbations, and (c) explainability metrics comprising:\n   - Attention Alignment Score (AAS): Quantifies overlap between model attention distributions and human-annotated semantic relevance maps.\n   - Semantic Provenance Consistency (SPC): Measures the stability of semantic feature attributions across output variants.\n\n3. These metrics are normalized and combined into a composite reward function: R = w_1 * Accuracy + w_2 * Replicability + w_3 * ExplainabilityScore, where ExplainabilityScore = α*AAS + β*SPC with α, β hyperparameters tunable via ablation.\n\n4. The RL agent updates prompt policies based on gradient ascent on R.\n\nWe formalize the reward and optimization update equations, ensuring transparency and reproducibility. Algorithm pseudocode and mathematical definitions are provided in supplementary materials. This tightly coupled integration of explainability and replicability metrics into prompt optimization represents a substantial advance over prior heuristic or ad hoc methods.\n\nTo further innovate, we incorporate user perceptions of uncertainty by augmenting the explanation feedback to reflect uncertainty verbally expressed through refined prompt templates, grounding explainability in user-centric communication and enhancing trust.\n\nThis method also applies to code generation prompts within integrated development environments (IDEs), demonstrating scalability and utility across diverse large-scale language model applications.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Define and validate explainability metrics:\n   - Collect human attention/relevance annotations on benchmark tasks (e.g., FAQ answering).\n   - Compute correlations between AAS/SPC and replicability measures under systematic perturbations.\n   - Perform statistical tests to confirm explainability metrics as meaningful proxies.\n\n2) Implement the RL-based prompt optimization algorithm with explicit, formal reward functions.\n\n3) Benchmark on standard datasets:\n   - Use large-scale, publicly available datasets for FAQ generation and code generation prompts.\n   - Apply controlled input perturbations (e.g., paraphrasing, noise injection) with predefined perturbation sizes and types.\n\n4) Conduct ablation studies:\n   - Remove or selectively modify explainability components (AAS only, SPC only).\n   - Compare variants with and without user-centric uncertainty expression.\n\n5) Evaluate the optimized prompts on:\n   - Replicability: Measured by output consistency metrics over perturbations.\n   - Task Accuracy: Standard performance metrics.\n   - Explanation Quality: Human evaluation with sample size of 30 experts rating interpretability and clarity; inter-rater agreement to be assessed.\n\n6) Perform robustness checks:\n   - Test alternate explainability metrics.\n   - Analyze sensitivity to reward weighting hyperparameters.\n\n7) Deploy in limited integrated development environment simulations for code generation to validate in realistic user-centric settings.\n\n8) Document all procedures with reproducible code and data splits.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: FAQ Answer Generation\n- Input: Variant forms of a question (e.g., 'What are your privacy policies?' vs. 'Could you explain your data protection measures?')\n- Expected output: Consistent, accurate answers highlighting a clear, human-interpretable rationale that aligns with relevance annotations.\n\nExample 2: Code Generation in IDE Simulation\n- Input: Natural language code requests with varying phrasing.\n- Expected output: Semantically stable and accurate code suggestions with explainability cues about the code logic related to the prompt.\n\nIn all cases, explanations must explicitly communicate uncertainty levels and reasoning pathways articulated in user-friendly language, strengthening user trust.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If explainability metrics (AAS, SPC) prove weakly correlated with replicability or fail to enhance optimization:\n\n- Shift to a multi-objective optimization framework prioritizing replicability and task accuracy explicitly without explainability constraints.\n- Integrate alternative explainability proxies, including model-agnostic techniques (LIME, SHAP) for comparison.\n- Incorporate a zero-shot baseline prompt evaluation to benchmark gains.\n- Augment evaluation with comprehensive user studies focused on perceptions of uncertainty and trust to refine or redefine appropriate feedback signals.\n\nThis adaptive recovery strategy ensures scientific rigor and continuous improvement despite uncertainties in initial assumptions."

Clarify the mechanism of integrating these metrics within the optimization loop, including how feedback signals are computed, weighted, and how they influence prompt modifications. Providing a clear mathematical or algorithmic formulation will strengthen the soundness of the approach and help ensure reproducibility and scientific rigor in this relatively novel integration of explainability into prompt engineering methods. Current description risks being perceived as high-level and conceptual without concrete operationalization, potentially weakening confidence in feasibility and replicability claims relevant to the problem statement and motivation sections.

Consider more detailed experimental design elements such as sample sizes, benchmark datasets, types of perturbations, and criteria for success in human evaluation. Also, integration of ablation studies to isolate contributions of each component (attention alignment, semantic provenance) and robustness checks against alternative explainability metrics would enhance robustness and scientific soundness of validation. These clear, systematic experimental protocols are crucial for demonstrating feasibility and directly address risks mentioned in the fallback plan."
