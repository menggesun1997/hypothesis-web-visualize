    "title": "Hybrid Symbolic-Neural Compression Framework for Explainable Multimodal Clinical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing compression methods for multimodal clinical LLMs focus on numeric parameter reduction with limited explainability and domain adaptation abilities, restricting clinician trust and reproducibility.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the 'heterogeneous medical data' and 'AI tools' gap, this idea proposes combining symbolic knowledge representations with neural compression to preserve interpretability and enable domain-aware replication across clinical settings.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid compression framework where neural compression aggressively reduces LLM weights while a co-trained symbolic module encodes key medical relations and decision paths extracted from knowledge graphs. The symbolic module guides neural pruning decisions and provides an interpretable layer producing human-readable explanations alongside model outputs. The framework adapts to domain shifts by updating symbolic rules, keeping compressed neural parts aligned for replicable performance.",

        "title": "Hybrid Symbolic-Neural Compression Framework with Dynamic Rule-Guided Pruning for Explainable and Adaptable Multimodal Clinical LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current compression methods for multimodal clinical large language models (LLMs) primarily focus on parameter reduction without integrating explicit domain knowledge, resulting in limited transparency, suboptimal domain adaptation, and incompletely trustworthy outputs for clinical stakeholders. This trade-off hampers reproducibility and clinician acceptance of AI tools in heterogeneous healthcare environments.",
        "Motivation": "While existing approaches achieve compression, they neglect dynamic synergy between interpretable symbolic knowledge and neural pruning mechanisms, which could enhance explanation fidelity and domain generalization. Addressing this gap with a rigorously designed hybrid framework can fill the translational chasm between AI research and clinical deployment. Our method advances beyond prior compression models by jointly optimizing neural weights and symbolic domain rules to maintain accuracy while producing clinically meaningful explanations — a key differentiator ensuring competitive novelty and practical impact in real-world health contexts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel Hybrid Symbolic-Neural Compression Framework leveraging dynamic rule-guided pruning and co-training to integrate symbolic medical knowledge and neural compression synergistically. \n\nKey components:\n1. Symbolic Module: Encodes medical relations and decision paths using a formal rule language inspired by process mining and context language models, dynamically represented as differentiable embeddings linked to a medical knowledge graph (e.g., SNOMED CT). Rules are parameterized for joint optimization.\n\n2. Neural Module: Compresses LLM weights through structured pruning guided by scalar gate variables.\n\n3. Joint Optimization Mechanism: Employs a bi-level training algorithm where the symbolic module influences pruning gates via a differentiable attention mechanism. Neural pruning masks are dynamically adjusted based on the symbolic rule activation scores, calibrated by a hybrid loss composed of prediction error, compression sparsity, and explanation fidelity (measured by a symmetric difference metric between symbolic explanations and neural attribution maps).\n\n4. Explanation Generation: Symbolic explanations are generated in real time by tracing active symbolic decision paths aligned with neural outputs, producing human-readable, rule-based rationales. Fidelity guarantees are ensured by minimizing discrepancies between symbolic and neural contribution measures during training.\n\n5. Domain Adaptation: Upon domain shifts, symbolic rules are updated or fine-tuned using incoming clinical guidelines or synthetic datasets generated from generative AI techniques, preserving neural compression alignment and facilitating replicable adaptation without retraining entire networks.\n\nThis framework innovatively blends symbolic knowledge parameterization, differentiable rule-neural interaction, and hybrid optimization schedules, making it reproducible and scalable for clinical applications.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Procurement: Use publicly available multimodal clinical datasets with high-quality annotations and expert-aligned clinical guidelines, such as MIMIC-CXR and the MedNLI dataset, supplemented by synthetic data generation using controlled generative AI to augment symbolic rule coverage as per International Union of Nutritional Sciences standards.\n2. Baseline Models: Train standard compressed clinical LLMs (e.g., MedPaLM) by conventional pruning.\n3. Symbolic Rule Extraction: Derive initial symbolic rules from expert knowledge bases and process mining of clinical workflows, encoded using differentiable parameterizations.\n4. Joint Training: Implement the bi-level optimization with alternating gradient updates — first updating neural pruning gates conditioned on symbolic attentions, then refining symbolic rule embeddings based on neural gradients.\n5. Evaluation Metrics: Measure accuracy (AUC, F1), compression ratio, interpretability metrics (explanation fidelity via symmetric difference and clinician-validated trust scores), and domain generalization (performance retention across shifted clinical datasets).\n6. Usability Studies: Engage clinicians early by iterative feedback cycles via structured interviews and task-based usability testing, defining success criteria such as explanation transparency and clinical decision support efficacy.\n7. Ablation Experiments: Isolate contributions of symbolic guidance and hybrid loss components to dissect impact.\n\nComprehensive documentation of optimization schedules, loss definitions, and dataset standards will be maintained for replication and extension.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multimodal clinical data including patient clinical notes and corresponding medical imaging.\n\nExpected Output: Diagnostic prediction with associated symbolic explanation tracing activated clinical rules (e.g., \"If chest X-ray shows consolidation and patient history indicates fever >38°C, then consider bacterial pneumonia\") aligned with neural outputs.\n\nPerformance Goals: Achieve accuracy comparable or superior to baselines with significantly higher explanation fidelity scores and robust domain transfer performance on external datasets. Clinician participants in usability studies report increased trust and decision-making support due to transparent symbolic rationales integrated with neural outputs.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic rule-guided pruning leads to unstable training or performance degradation, we will modularize the symbolic component as a post-hoc interpreter generating explanations from frozen compressed networks. Additionally, we will explore knowledge distillation techniques to embed symbolic knowledge into neural embeddings to retain interpretability. Hybrid explanation approaches combining statistical attributions and symbolic rules will be experimented to balance interpretability and accuracy, while maintaining compression efficacy. Generative AI-driven synthetic data augmentation will be increased to enhance symbolic rule coverage and facilitate domain adaptations."

The interaction between the symbolic module guiding neural pruning and co-training dynamics needs clearer specification, especially regarding how symbolic rules dynamically influence pruning decisions without causing instability or degraded performance. Detailed algorithmic descriptions, examples of symbolic rule representations, and mechanisms for joint optimization would strengthen soundness and reproducibility of the method. Clarifying how symbolic explanations are generated alongside neural outputs with fidelity guarantees will also enhance trust in the hybrid approach, especially in clinical contexts where explainability is critical. This will mitigate risks that the symbolic component becomes either superficial or overly intrusive on model capacity during compression, preserving both interpretability and accuracy effectively in practice. Please elaborate this mechanism in more technical depth and with preliminary design considerations or theoretical foundations wherever applicable in the \"Proposed_Method\" section to solidify the concept's soundness and clarity of contribution."

First, the plan depends on multimodal clinical datasets with expert-annotated clinical guidelines, which are notoriously hard to procure with sufficient scale and annotation quality — this data dependency should be clarified, including planned datasets and annotation standards. Second, joint optimization of neural compression with symbolic knowledge injection is a novel and complex task; concrete strategies or baseline techniques should be proposed, for instance, specifying optimization schedules, loss functions, or hybrid training algorithms. Third, usability studies with clinicians involve significant logistical challenges — early engagement plans and success criteria should be outlined. Moreover, key evaluation metrics like explanation fidelity and domain generalization, while pertinent, need precise operational definitions and benchmark methods described. Addressing these uncertainties in the \"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\" will improve confidence that the experiments can be realistically conducted and demonstrate the proposed method's claimed benefits effectively in clinical scenarios."
