        "title": "Multimodal Learned Compression and Federated Distillation for Robust Resource-Constrained LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current approaches to federated learning for large language models (LLMs) in clinical settings struggle to effectively integrate heterogeneous multimodal medical data (including images, text, and metadata) while adhering to stringent computational, communication, and privacy constraints. Existing compression and federated distillation methods lack modality-aware mechanisms that preserve cross-modal consistency and robustness against noisy, imbalanced clinical data distributions, limiting replicable LLM performance and fairness across diverse healthcare environments.",
        "Motivation": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE verdict, this work explicitly targets the underexplored intersection of resource-efficient federated learning, modality-specific learned compression, and rigorous knowledge distillation in clinical multimodal contexts. By designing explicit parameter-efficient codecs tailored for each modality and integrating them with a novel modality-consistency-aware federated distillation framework, we aim to advance beyond current state-of-the-art multimodal federated and compression techniques. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art vision-language models and parameter-efficient tuning to achieve robust, lightweight LLMs deployable on resource-constrained edge devices in clinical federated settings, ensuring both generalization and fairness. This is critical for enabling trustworthy intelligent decision-making in healthcare institutions with limited computational resources and heterogeneous data sources.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a federated learning framework consisting of multiple clinical clients, each with heterogeneous multimodal data (e.g., chest X-rays, patient text records, metadata). For each modality, we design and implement parameter-efficient learned codecs: convolutional neural networks with lightweight bottleneck layers for image compression, transformer-based token reducers for text, and embedding quantization for metadata. These codecs are trained locally to compress modality-specific inputs before feeding them into a multimodal student LLM.\n\nKnowledge distillation is performed via communication-efficient logit aggregation: clients compute modality-specific distillation losses combining cross-entropy and consistency regularizers that enforce alignment across modalities and between teacher and student representations. The distillation loss incorporates weighting terms to balance modality contributions and mitigate imbalances due to data heterogeneity and noise.\n\nAt each communication round, clients share averaged logits rather than full model weights to minimize communication overhead while preserving privacy. The central server aggregates these logits via a weighted fusion scheme that accounts for client reliability and modality confidence, then updates the global student LLM parameters using a federated optimization algorithm incorporating differential privacy mechanisms.\n\nTo ensure cross-modal consistency post-distillation, we introduce an auxiliary cross-modal contrastive loss between modality embeddings within the student model, which encourages aligned semantic representations.\n\nThe entire pipeline is systematically depicted via detailed workflow diagrams, and a comprehensive pseudocode algorithm outlines key steps: \n1) modality-specific compression;\n2) local training with distillation and modality-specific losses;\n3) logit aggregation and global update at the server;\n4) privacy-preserving mechanisms.\n\nIncorporation of vision-language model architectures enables advanced multimodal understanding, aligning with recent advances in natural language processing and federated intelligence for resource-constrained clinical edge devices.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset Preparation and Federated Simulation Setup:\n  - Use multiple federated medical datasets with multimodal data (MIMIC-CXR, NIH ChestX-ray, and federated splits of MIMIC-III textual records).\n  - Simulate a realistic federated environment with 20+ clinical clients, diverse data distributions, and varying network constraints (bandwidth, latency) mimicking real hospital settings.\n  \n2. Baseline and Ablation Studies:\n  - Implement and benchmark classical compression (JPEG2000 for images, token pruning for text) and federated learning baselines (FedAvg, FedDistill) without modality-specific losses.\n  - Conduct single-modality compression experiments to validate each codec's efficiency before full multimodal fusion.\n\n3. Proposed Method Implementation:\n  - Develop modality-specific learned codecs with architectural details provided.\n  - Implement federated knowledge distillation with explicit modality-specific and cross-modal consistency losses.\n  - Integrate differential privacy modules for communication privacy during logit sharing.\n\n4. Iterative Training and Evaluation:\n  - Train clients locally, aggregate logits, update global model over 100 communication rounds.\n  - Track model accuracy, compression ratio, communication overhead, privacy budget, and training time.\n\n5. Cross-Site Generalization and Robustness:\n  - Evaluate on held-out hospital data to test domain generalization.\n  - Stress-test under induced noise and modality imbalance scenarios.\n\n6. Fairness and Bias Analysis:\n  - Compute fairness metrics across demographic subgroups to evaluate bias mitigation.\n\n7. Integration and Real-World Validation:\n  - Deploy the global lightweight LLM in a clinical decision support simulation platform for qualitative and quantitative feedback.\n\n8. Success Criteria:\n  - Compression ratio > 60% with <5% drop in diagnostic accuracy compared to centralized models.\n  - Communication overhead reductions > 50% versus existing federated weight-sharing methods.\n  - Differential privacy guarantees with epsilon < 1.0.\n  - Fairness metric improvements over baselines.\n\nDocument all experimental configurations, hyperparameters, and results to ensure reproducibility and transparency.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: At a client hospital, a multimodal patient record consisting of chest X-ray images, free-text clinical notes, and metadata (age, gender, vitals) is locally compressed using the modality-specific learned codecs.\n\nExpected Output:\n- Compressed image embeddings via CNN bottleneck codec;\n- Text embeddings through transformer-based token reduction;\n- Quantized metadata embeddings.\n\nThese compressed embeddings are passed into the local student LLM, which produces modality-wise logits. The distillation loss is computed using:  \n- Cross-entropy against local teacher models;\n- Cross-modal contrastive consistency loss ensuring semantic alignment.\n\nAveraged logits are securely transmitted to the central server, which aggregates them using weighted fusion accounting for client data quality and modality reliability.\n\nThe updated global student LLM after aggregation demonstrates:\n- >60% overall compression relative to full multimodal inputs;\n- Diagnostic accuracy within 95% of centralized (non-federated) oracle performance;\n- Improved fairness metrics across patient subgroups;\n- Preserved cross-modal consistency evidenced by embedding similarity metrics.\n\nThis process repeats across federated clients, iteratively enhancing the lightweight global model suitable for deployment on resource-limited edge devices.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If pure logit-based knowledge distillation induces performance degradation, investigate a hybrid approach combining partial model weight sharing with logit aggregation to capture richer representation updates.\n\nFurther enhance modality-specific compression by integrating adaptive regularization techniques based on client data quality and modality noise levels.\n\nIntroduce server-side data augmentation strategies leveraging synthetic multimodal patient data generated via federated GANs or diffusion models to improve robustness and generalization.\n\nExplore federated reinforcement learning paradigms incorporating reward signals from clinical decision support outcomes to adaptively tune compression-distillation trade-offs.\n\nShould privacy-preserving mechanisms adversely impact model accuracy, consider optimizing privacy budgets via per-client adaptive clipping and noise mechanisms balancing utility and security concerns."

It should explicitly describe the architecture of the parameter-efficient learned codecs for each modality and detail the integration strategy ensuring the student LLM maintains cross-modal consistency post-distillation. Clarifying these mechanisms will strengthen confidence in the method's soundness and reproducibility, particularly under noisy real-world medical data conditions common in federated scenarios, thus mitigating risks of degradation due to heterogeneous client distributions or modality imbalances. Consider providing algorithmic pseudocode or detailed workflow diagrams for key steps such as compression, distillation loss computation, and server aggregation to enhance technical clarity and soundness of the approach in this challenging multimodal federated setting, especially given the complexity of clinical data modalities involved in downstream decision support applications. This will also facilitate solid experimental validation of the core assumptions originally presented in the Problem_Statement section regarding replicable LLM performance under resource constraints with multimodal inputs in federated learning contexts. Targeting this feedback first will improve the proposal’s technical depth and increase its chances of successful implementation and evaluation in experimental phases.

          "feedback_content": "While the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan covers key stages from dataset selection to fairness evaluation, it would benefit from increased practical detail and prioritization to enhance feasibility. For example, the plan should specify the exact federated learning simulation setup (number of clients, communication rounds, realistic network conditions) to realistically capture resource constraints. It should also clarify the selection and design of baselines, emphasizing comparisons with state-of-the-art multimodal federated or learned compression methods. Furthermore, early-stage ablation studies or pilot experiments focusing on single-modality compression before full multimodal fusion could improve developmental feasibility. Explicit consideration of privacy and security measures during federated distillation, especially in clinical data contexts, is critical and currently overlooked. Additionally, the plan should define quantitative success criteria for compression ratio, accuracy retention, communication overhead, and fairness metrics with clear thresholds to guide iterative development. Addressing these points will help ensure the proposed experiments are scientifically rigorous, practically executable, and adequately capture the complex interplay between model compression, multimodal data, and federated learning under clinical deployment constraints. This strengthened experimental plan will substantially increase the proposal’s reliability and demonstrate feasibility to reviewers and potential clinical collaborators.
