        "title": "Bias-Aware Domain Generalization in Compressed LLMs via Fairness-Regularized Knowledge Injection with Explicit Graph-Text Integration and Deployment-Aware Evaluation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Compressed large language models (LLMs) deployed in heterogeneous clinical environments face domain shifts that induce unrecognized biases, jeopardizing fairness, trustworthiness, and safety in critical medical decision-making. Existing bias mitigation methods struggle to integrate heterogeneous fairness knowledge and maintain model capacity under compression constraints, limiting domain generalization and clinical usability.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work explores fairness regularization or knowledge graph injection separately, our approach uniquely bridges the two by explicitly integrating domain-specific fairness knowledge graphs into compressed LLMs using a rigorously defined graph-attention fusion architecture optimized with fairness-regularized loss tailored for clinical domain shifts. Addressing both representational heterogeneity and operational constraints, we enable better bias mitigation in real-world compressed LLM clinical deployments. This method advances beyond strong baselines by combining graph neural network interpretability, fairness metrics, and deployment-aware inference considerations to ensure scalable, stable, and transparent AI tools in healthcare.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel architecture where domain-specific fairness knowledge graphs \u001bencoded as heterogeneous graph embeddings with node type-aware Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\u001b are integrated at multiple layers of a compressed Transformer-based LLM via a graph-text fusion module:\n\n1. Graph Encoding: Construct fairness knowledge graphs where nodes represent protected attributes, clinical features, and outcomes, encoded using a heterogeneous GNN variant (e.g., RGCN) producing embeddings E_G.\n\n2. Graph-Text Fusion: During LLM finetuning, introduce a graph-aware attention module that injects E_G into Transformer layers by computing cross-attention weights between token embeddings E_T and graph embeddings E_G. Specifically, at selected Transformer layers, we compute attention scores A_i = softmax((Q_T K_G^T)/sqrt(d)) where Q_T=E_T W_Q and K_G=E_G W_K are projections; value vectors V_G=E_G W_V modulate token representations via weighted sums, producing fused embeddings E_F used in subsequent layers.\n\n3. Fairness-Regularized Loss: Define the total finetuning objective as L = L_task + \u0003 * L_fairness, where\n  - L_task is standard cross-entropy or clinical task loss,\n  - L_fairness = \u0003 * \u001d_{\text{metric}}(P_{subgroups}) enforces fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity or equalized odds) computed over validation minibatches,\n  with \u0003 a dynamically tuned hyperparameter.\nGradient backpropagation updates both LLM and GNN parameters jointly.\n\n4. Stability & Continual Updates: To prevent instability during online knowledge graph updates, adopt periodic batch updates with moving average smoothing of graph embeddings and adaptively adjust \u0003 based on validation fairness-accuracy trade-offs using multi-objective optimization (e.g., Pareto front search).\n\n5. Interpretability & Monitoring: Generate post-hoc explanations by tracing attention weights between tokens and fairness graph nodes, producing fairness influence scores per prediction for clinician interpretability.\n\n6. Compression Awareness: Incorporate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) style modules in graph-text fusion to minimize additional parameters and inference latency.\n\nThis structured and mathematically explicit integration ensures the model leverages curated fairness knowledge effectively without degrading capacity or stability under compression and domain shifts.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:\n   - Select multiple heterogeneous clinical datasets with annotated demographic variables (age, ethnicity, gender) totaling ~50K records.\n   - Apply consistent demographic annotation schemas and perform missing data imputation.\n   - Document dataset sizes, distributions, and bias characteristics.\n\n2. Fairness Knowledge Graph Construction:\n   - Collaborate with domain experts to build and validate heterogeneous fairness graphs capturing relationships between protected attributes, clinical features, and outcomes.\n   - Assess graph quality using internal metrics (e.g., Davies-Bouldin score, Calinski-Harabasz index) for cluster coherence and coverage.\n   - Contingency: If graph coverage is insufficient, augment with semi-automated knowledge discovery from literature and embeddings.\n\n3. Model Finetuning and Integration:\n   - Implement the graph-text fusion architecture with low-rank injection modules ensuring <10% additional parameters.\n   - Incrementally finetune compressed LLMs (e.g., quantized BERT variants) with and without graph injections.\n   - Monitor training stability metrics (loss curves, gradient norms).\n\n4. Evaluation Protocols:\n   - Evaluate predictive accuracy, calibration (ECE), fairness metrics (demographic parity difference, equalized odds gap) on held-out datasets.\n   - Measure inference latency under deployment-like conditions.\n   - Benchmark interpretability outputs against clinician feedback scores.\n\n5. Deployment Simulation and Integration:\n   - Prototype integration with clinical workflow simulation tools measuring system latency, throughput, and user feedback incorporation.\n   - Test continuous bias monitoring pipeline triggering periodic knowledge graph embedding updates.\n   - Contingency: If latency exceeds threshold (>200ms per query), prune fusion layers or switch to asynchronous knowledge updates.\n\n6. Incremental Validation Milestones:\n   - Milestone 1: Demonstrate improved fairness metrics without accuracy loss on benchmark clinical dataset.\n   - Milestone 2: Validate interpretability reports aligned with clinical fairness concerns.\n   - Milestone 3: Deploy prototype with simulated real-time constraints.\n\n7. Rigorous Documentation and Reproducibility:\n   - Open-source codebase, model checkpoints, graph construction protocols.\n   - Detailed logs of training, validation, and deployment performance.",

Input: De-identified clinical encounter records including demographic info (age, ethnicity), with complex comorbidities.\n   Expected Output: Risk predictions for adverse events with reduced disparate impact (difference <3%) in false positive rates across age and ethnicity subgroups.\n   Interpretability Report: Token-level explanations highlighting graph nodes (e.g., ethnicity node influence) that modulate prediction confidence.\n\n2. Input: Synthetic clinical notes missing some demographic fields.\n   Expected Output: Stable predictions with fallback fairness regularization despite incomplete data.\n\n3. System-level: Simulated clinical tool calls under real-time latency budget (<200ms response time).\n   Expected Output: Inference latency measurements confirming deployment feasibility with fusion modules active.\n\n4. Continuous bias monitoring:\n   Input: Stream of new clinical data exhibiting demographic shifts.\n   Expected Output: Automatic trigger of knowledge graph embedding updates maintaining fairness metrics within specified bounds.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If graph-text fusion modules degrade model capacity or induce training instability, proceed with a two-stage strategy:\n\n1. Fairness Knowledge Distillation:\n   - Train a large teacher model with fairness graph inputs.\n   - Distill knowledge into compressed student LLM without direct graph fusion, retaining fairness properties.\n\n2. Adversarial Debiasing Post-Processing:\n   - Implement adversarial classifiers to minimize protected attribute leakage on LLM outputs.\n   - Incorporate user feedback loops within clinical deployment to iteratively refine bias constraints.\n\n3. System Engineering:\n   - Optimize latency by pruning or quantizing fusion layers.\n   - Explore asynchronous or offline knowledge graph embedding updates to preserve runtime performance.\n\nAll fallback approaches will be rigorously benchmarked against the main method to ensure acceptable trade-offs between fairness, accuracy, and latency in clinical settings."

However, the mechanism details lack clarity on how the attention modules effectively integrate heterogeneous graph structures with textual LLM representations, especially considering compression constraints. The process by which fairness metrics guide the regularization and how continuous graph updates interplay with model stability is also under-specified. To strengthen soundness, concretely define the architectural integration, elaborating how the graph embeddings interact with language model layers, and specify the mathematical formulation for fairness loss regularization and its optimization during finetuning. This clarity is critical to assess whether the approach can truly mitigate biases without impairing model capacity or causing instability in compressed models under domain shifts, particularly in high-stakes clinical contexts. This targeted enhancement will elevate confidence in the methodological rigor and reproducibility of the approach within the compressed LLM fairness domain, which is notably complex and competitive due to existing strong baselines and approaches in graph neural networks and bias mitigation literature.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is comprehensive but ambitious, spanning data collection, graph construction, model finetuning, comprehensive evaluation, workflow integration, and continual bias monitoring. However, it currently lacks detailed plans addressing challenges in feasibility such as annotating demographics consistently across heterogeneous clinical datasets, validating the quality and coverage of fairness knowledge graphs, and examples of concrete evaluation protocols for interpretability reports. Moreover, clinical deployment integration and continuous monitoring imply operational challenges (e.g., latency, user feedback mechanisms) that are underexplored. To improve feasibility, add explicit milestones with contingency strategies for data quality gaps, model capacity issues due to graph injections, and system latency constraints during real-world deployment. Incorporate metrics such as inference latency and consider benchmarking with real-time clinical tool constraints. Clarify dataset sizes and selection criteria, and plan for incremental validations rather than end-to-end immediate deployments. This will make the experiment plan more robust, scientifically credible, and implementable in the complex, regulated clinical environment targeted by the proposal."
