    "title": "Explainable LLM Validation Pipeline with Regulatory Compliance Auditing",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM validation in clinical NLP lacks interpretability and fails to integrate seamlessly into clinical development pipelines under regulatory scrutiny.",
    "Motivation": "Responds to internal gaps in interpretability, reproducibility, and embedding AI validation within clinical research pipelines by creating an explainable validation pipeline aligned with regulatory requirements.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a modular validation pipeline featuring explainability-first architecture that generates human-understandable reports on LLM decision processes. Incorporate traceable provenance logs, automated compliance checks against regulatory standards, and support for incremental model updates to enhance reproducibility across academic NLP benchmarks in clinical domains.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Map regulatory requirements relevant to AI clinical tools; 2) Develop explainability modules (e.g., attention visualization, feature importance); 3) Integrate these within a pipeline supporting standardized clinical NLP benchmarks; 4) Test pipeline on retrospective clinical NLP datasets; 5) Conduct user studies with regulatory and clinical experts; 6) Benchmark improvements in auditability and replicability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prediction of eligibility for a clinical trial based on patient notes. Output: Explainability report detailing which tokens, concepts, and constraints influenced each decision including regulatory compliance check outcomes.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If full automation of regulatory checks is unfeasible, provide semi-automated reporting tools assisted by expert review. Also plan phased rollouts targeting simpler clinical trial types initially."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that an explainability-first validation pipeline can fully satisfy regulatory compliance requirements needs clearer substantiation. Regulatory standards in clinical AI are rapidly evolving and often ambiguous, and the proposal does not clearly discuss handling ambiguities or differences across jurisdictions. It is recommended to explicitly specify which regulatory frameworks are targeted and provide initial evidence of how the explainability modules effectively satisfy those specific requirements to strengthen the assumption's validity and practical relevance in the clinical NLP domain. This will help avoid overpromising compliance without rigorous grounding in regulatory realities and increase the proposal's soundness and credibility across clinical research environments that differ in regulatory expectations. This also aligns with clarifying how the pipeline complements, rather than replaces, expert regulatory review, especially given the fallback plan's semi-automated checks approach. Consider collaboration with regulatory experts early in the design phase and pilot validation to refine assumptions embedded in the pipeline's architecture and compliance checking modules to ensure robustness of the core concept under real-world regulatory stringency and complexity constraints, which are hinted at but not sufficiently detailed today in the Method description and Experiment Plan sections (Step 1 and 5)."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "To enhance both novelty and impact given the pre-screened classification as NOV-COMPETITIVE, integrating domain-relevant concepts such as 'Intensive Care Unit domain' and 'clinical decision support systems' could significantly broaden the proposal's scope and applicability. For example, by adapting the explainable validation pipeline to handle multi-modal clinical data including omics data types and patient notes from ICU settings, the method could address urgent needs for transparent, trustworthy AI under high-stakes conditions. Incorporating bioinformatics tools and rule-based systems alongside LLM outputs may bolster explainability and compliance auditing sophistication, leading to richer, actionable insights for clinicians and regulators alike. This integration would also facilitate benchmarking on a wider set of clinical NLP tasks beyond trial eligibility, thereby elevating the innovation's competitiveness and practical contribution. I propose the team investigate how to embed such modular expansions early in the pipeline design, including mechanisms to visualize or quantify feature importance respecting omics and ICU-specific data characteristics, thus broadening impact and enhancing cross-disciplinary adoption potential as suggested in the global concepts list."
