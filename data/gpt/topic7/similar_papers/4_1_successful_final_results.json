    "title": "Adaptive Learned Video and Image Compression for Multimodal Medical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs integrating medical imaging and textual data face computational bottlenecks due to inefficient handling of high-dimensional multimodal inputs, limiting deployment in low-resource healthcare settings.",
    "Motivation": "Building on the novel external gap linking 'compression approaches' and 'AI tools,' this research introduces a learned, adaptive compression pipeline that jointly optimizes image/video compression tailored to LLM input pipelines, enhancing computational efficiency beyond traditional compression or model pruning alone.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a joint multimodal encoder integrating learned video/image compression modules (e.g., neural codecs with transformer-based predictors) conditioned on LLM attention maps. Employ a differentiable compression-loss tradeoff module dynamically adjusting compression levels per input complexity and model sensitivity. Couple this with transformer pruning to minimize redundant computation while preserving downstream clinical task performance. The pipeline is designed for seamless integration into AI clinical workflow tools for real-time inference.",

        "title": "Federated and Hyperparameter-Optimized Adaptive Compression for Multimodal Medical LLMs with Stable Joint Training",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) integrating high-dimensional medical imaging and textual data suffer from computational inefficiencies and privacy concerns, hindering their deployment in low-resource, privacy-sensitive healthcare settings. Existing compression methods do not simultaneously optimize adaptive, multimodal compression with model pruning in a way that assures training stability and effective privacy preservation across distributed medical institutions.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work explores learned image and video compression or pruning for model acceleration individually, there remains a critical gap in jointly optimizing adaptive compression pipelines tailored for multimodal medical LLM inputs with formal stability guarantees and privacy-preserving training paradigms. By integrating federated learning and hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) into adaptive compression mechanisms conditioned on LLM attentions, our approach elevates beyond existing methods to deliver computationally efficient, clinically reliable, and privacy-conscious inference solutions. This represents a novel convergence of adaptive multimodal compression, stable end-to-end joint training, and federated personalized tuning, ultimately boosting deployability and generalizability in heterogeneous, resource-constrained clinical environments.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular, hierarchical pipeline comprising three key components:  \n\n1. **Adaptive Multimodal Learned Compression Modules:** Neural codecs for video/image streams conditioned on attention maps from the LLM's intermediate transformer layers. Conditioning is realized via cross-modal gating: attention maps modulate the latent feature priors in the codec encoder through learned FiLM layers, enabling compression parameters to dynamically focus on clinically salient regions.  \n\n2. **Differentiable Compression-Loss Tradeoff Module:** We define a composite loss combining reconstruction distortion, downstream diagnostic accuracy, and computational cost, balanced via a learned weighting vector updated through meta-gradients. Gradient clipping, scheduled learning rates, and auxiliary stabilization losses (e.g., feature alignment) are employed to ensure training stability during joint optimization of compression and transformer pruning.  \n\n3. **Transformer Pruning Integration:** Structured pruning masks are jointly learned with the compression modules, coordinated by a multi-objective optimizer that preserves diagnostic accuracy under pruning constraints. Pruning decisions are informed by gradients propagated through the adaptive compression module, enabling end-to-end co-adaptation.  \n\n4. **Federated Learning and Hyper-Parameter Optimization Layer:** The entire pipeline is trained across distributed healthcare sites via federated averaging, ensuring data privacy. Per-site hyper-parameters (e.g., compression bitrate, pruning sparsity) are dynamically tuned using Bayesian optimization in a federated manner to optimize local performance without direct data sharing.  \n\nAlgorithmic sketches will specify operations per mini-batch, attention conditioning computations, joint gradient updates with stability heuristics, and federated parameter aggregation protocols to guarantee reproducibility. This combined design promotes robustness, privacy, and practical deployability in complex clinical AI pipelines.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Acquire comprehensive multimodal clinical datasets spanning radiology videos, dynamic ultrasound, and textual reports from collaborating hospitals.  \n2. Initialize baseline multimodal LLMs with fixed compression and pruning presets to establish benchmarks.  \n3. Implement the detailed adaptive compression modules with attention-conditioned neural codecs and differentiable multi-objective loss.  \n4. Integrate transformer pruning layers with joint training stabilization techniques such as gradient clipping and auxiliary losses.  \n5. Develop federated training infrastructure enabling decentralized optimization across sites with secure aggregation.  \n6. Incorporate federated Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization to tailor compression and pruning parameters per-site.  \n7. Conduct comprehensive evaluations of latency, energy consumption, diagnostic accuracy, and compression quality (PSNR, SSIM) across modalities and deployment sites.  \n8. Perform ablation studies isolating adaptive compression, pruning, federated learning, and HPO impacts to establish contributions.  \n9. Deploy and validate prototype in low-resource hospital environments with real-world clinical usability studies and regulatory compliance assessments.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Ultrasound video sequences and accompanying clinical text reports from multiple privacy-sensitive hospital sites.  \nExpected Output: Adaptive compressed video embeddings modulated by LLM attention, with dynamically pruned transformer layers, yielding:  \n- Diagnostic accuracy within 1% of uncompressed gold standard.  \n- At least 50% reduction in average computation time and energy per inference.  \n- Compression quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM) optimized per site via federated hyper-parameter tuning.  \n- Stable training convergence demonstrated by consistent accuracy across federated rounds.  \n- Usability feedback indicating seamless integration in clinical workflow without latency bottlenecks.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If joint end-to-end training of adaptive compression and pruning destabilizes despite applied safeguards, fallback to a staged training scheme will be adopted: first optimizing fixed compression presets with pruning, then fine-tuning adaptive modules independently. If federated training is impeded by network constraints or convergence issues, a hybrid approach using federated pretraining followed by local fine-tuning per hospital will be tested. Should hyper-parameter optimization slow convergence, manual heuristics or domain-specific compression parameter grids will be explored. Hardware-aware quantization and per-domain customized compression codecs will supplement performance gains if universal models underperform. Comprehensive logging and modular code structure will enable graceful integration of fallback methods ensuring clinical robustness and usability."

However, the mechanism lacks clarity on how compression modules dynamically interact with LLM attention and how the differentiable compression-loss tradeoff will be optimized end-to-end without destabilizing training. Clarify design details, e.g., how conditioning is implemented, stability safeguards, and integration with transformer pruning to ensure a coherent and trainable pipeline. Providing algorithmic sketches or pseudo-code will help improve soundness and reproducibility for reviewers and implementers alike. This clarity is crucial given the complexity of joint optimization involving heterogeneous modules and modalities in medical contexts where stability is paramount for clinical use cases and regulatory considerations. Without these details, the practical viability and correctness of the method remain uncertain, hindering confidence in the proposed approach's validation and eventual deployment potentials. Please elaborate and strengthen the technical description in Proposed_Method accordingly, potentially supported by preliminary ablation insights or theoretical reasoning about convergence/stability guarantees if available.  Targeting clarity here will strongly raise the foundational confidence in the core mechanism's soundness and potential success during experimentation and real-world integration phases, thus meriting priority attention and resolution before progressing too far into implementation phases or claims of expected impact with low risk assumptions.  This will also help peers accurately judge the novelty and technical contribution relative to competitive prior arts noted in the novelty pre-screening stage, reducing risk of overstated claims or unforeseen failure modes in complex multimodal clinical AI pipelines.  Overall, this feedback urges refining the proposed mechanism expository rigor, providing technical specificity, and addressing joint training challenges upfront for soundness assurance and smoother downstream development lifecycle processes, thereby maximizing feasibility and impact chances downstream by design.  \n\n(Section: Proposed_Method)  \n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty pre-assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the core idea involving adaptive compression for multimodal medical LLMs, the project can strategically enhance impact and originality by integrating concepts from 'federated learning' and 'hyper-parameter optimization' within the adaptive compression pipeline. Specifically, exploring federated learning paradigms to collaboratively train compression modules across distributed healthcare sites without sharing sensitive patient data can expand deployment feasibility in privacy-constrained low-resource environments. Concurrently, applying hyper-parameter optimization or even AutoML techniques to dynamically tune compression parameters per site or modality can further boost performance tailoring beyond manually designed adaptive heuristics. This layered approach would differentiate the work from existing learned compression and multimodal fusion pipelines by jointly addressing privacy, adaptability, and computational efficiency in real-world heterogeneous medical settings. Including these globally-linked concepts would deepen the novelty, broaden the translational impact, and better position the research as a flagship contribution at the intersection of compressive multimodal AI and privacy-preserving federated medical ML, aligning with current cutting-edge trends and unmet clinical deployment needs. This strategic augmentation aligns well with the proposed fallback options exploring customized compressors and hardware-aware quantization, consolidating robustness and adaptability advantages. Consider embedding federated training protocols and automated per-site compression tuning into the experiment plan and method design phases to fully realize these synergistic benefits and elevate the project's competitive standing and community relevance.
