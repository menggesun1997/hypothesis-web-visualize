    "title": "Hybrid Multi-Agent Framework Linking Co-Design, Access Control, and Clinician-Patient Interaction for Personalized AI Governance",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a critical absence of integrated frameworks connecting co-design methodologies with access control systems and clinician-patient interaction modalities for holistic AI governance in healthcare.",
    "Motivation": "This idea synthesizes the hidden bridge gap that reveals siloed research clusters, devising a multi-agent system that harmonizes these domains to ensure bias stability and fairness in LLM deployments, moving beyond linear pipelines.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a distributed multi-agent framework where separate agents manage co-design facilitation, attribute-based access control enforcement, and clinician-patient interaction enhancement. These agents communicate in real-time to co-adapt privacy policies, transparency settings, and AI responses individualized per user context. The framework employs decentralized learning with consensus protocols to maintain alignment and fairness across all modules.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Simulate healthcare ecosystem scenarios involving multiple stakeholders; 2. Develop modular agents with clear APIs for co-design inputs, access decisions, and interaction management; 3. Benchmark integrated system against isolated modules on fairness, security, and user satisfaction; 4. Explore scalability on cloud infrastructure; 5. Analyze bias propagation and mitigation effectiveness via synthetic adversarial tests.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient requests restricted data sharing; co-design agent updates preferences; access control agent modifies policies; interaction agent adjusts AI explanations accordingly. Expected Output: Consistent updated policy enforcement, user-aware AI interaction preserving trust and fairness.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If agent coordination is unstable, introduce a central governance controller; if decentralized learning is too slow, opt for periodic synchronization checkpoints."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed multi-agent framework involves complex coordination between agents responsible for co-design, access control, and clinician-patient interaction, using decentralized learning and consensus protocols. However, the mechanism by which real-time communication, consensus, and privacy-preserving learning occur is underspecified. The proposal should detail clear communication protocols, how disagreements among agents get resolved without centralized control, and how privacy and security are guaranteed during decentralized learning, especially given healthcareâ€™s regulatory environment. Clarification on these mechanisms is crucial for assessing soundness and practical viability of the approach, particularly since real-time adaptation under tight constraints is challenging in such multi-agent settings and high-stakes domains like healthcare. Including architectural diagrams or formal algorithm descriptions would improve clarity and confidence in the proposed solution's soundness and novelty beyond incremental integration of existing components in a competitive space (NOV-COMPETITIVE). Targeted improvements here will sharpen theoretical foundation and experimental design robustness as well as ease reproducibility and comparison with the state of the art."

          "feedback_content": "The stepwise experiment plan outlines a logical progression from simulated scenarios to benchmarking and scalability analysis, covering fairness, security, and user satisfaction. However, it currently lacks detail about metrics, baseline references, and validation methodology. To increase feasibility, the plan must explicitly define evaluation metrics for bias stability, fairness, and security in multi-agent healthcare AI contexts; specify relevant baseline systems or ablation variants; and describe the nature and source of synthetic adversarial tests for bias propagation. Moreover, feasibility concerns exist regarding scalability assessment on cloud infrastructure without clarifying resource requirements, data availability, and integration procedures. Including a risk mitigation strategy beyond fallback coordination or synchronization checkpoints (e.g., incremental prototyping and pilot clinical collaboration) would strengthen practical feasibility and enhance experimental credibility critical in healthcare AI governance research."
