    "title": "Adaptive Learned Video and Image Compression for Multimodal Medical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs integrating medical imaging and textual data face computational bottlenecks due to inefficient handling of high-dimensional multimodal inputs, limiting deployment in low-resource healthcare settings.",
    "Motivation": "Building on the novel external gap linking 'compression approaches' and 'AI tools,' this research introduces a learned, adaptive compression pipeline that jointly optimizes image/video compression tailored to LLM input pipelines, enhancing computational efficiency beyond traditional compression or model pruning alone.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct a joint multimodal encoder integrating learned video/image compression modules (e.g., neural codecs with transformer-based predictors) conditioned on LLM attention maps. Employ a differentiable compression-loss tradeoff module dynamically adjusting compression levels per input complexity and model sensitivity. Couple this with transformer pruning to minimize redundant computation while preserving downstream clinical task performance. The pipeline is designed for seamless integration into AI clinical workflow tools for real-time inference.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multimodal datasets (radiology videos, dynamic ultrasounds, clinical notes).\n2. Develop baseline LLM with fixed image/video compression.\n3. Implement the adaptive learned compression pipeline.\n4. Evaluate end-to-end latency, energy use, diagnostic accuracy, and quality of compressed media.\n5. Perform ablation to assess impact of adaptive compression vs static.\n6. Deploy prototype in low-resource hospital environment with clinician usability study.\n7. Metrics include PSNR, SSIM for images, diagnostic classification scores, compute cost, and throughput.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Ultrasound video frames and corresponding textual report.\nExpected output: Compressed video embeddings passed to LLM with minimized latency.\nFinal diagnostic suggestion matches original accuracy within 1% margin with 50% computing time savings.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive compression introduces instability, fallback to a hybrid approach combining fixed compression presets with dynamic quality selection. Investigate per-domain custom compressors if universal model underperforms. Alternatively, leverage hardware-aware model quantization complementary to compression."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an ambitious joint multimodal encoder combining adaptive learned video/image compression conditioned on LLM attention maps and transformer pruning. However, the mechanism lacks clarity on how compression modules dynamically interact with LLM attention and how the differentiable compression-loss tradeoff will be optimized end-to-end without destabilizing training. Clarify design details, e.g., how conditioning is implemented, stability safeguards, and integration with transformer pruning to ensure a coherent and trainable pipeline. Providing algorithmic sketches or pseudo-code will help improve soundness and reproducibility for reviewers and implementers alike. This clarity is crucial given the complexity of joint optimization involving heterogeneous modules and modalities in medical contexts where stability is paramount for clinical use cases and regulatory considerations. Without these details, the practical viability and correctness of the method remain uncertain, hindering confidence in the proposed approach's validation and eventual deployment potentials. Please elaborate and strengthen the technical description in Proposed_Method accordingly, potentially supported by preliminary ablation insights or theoretical reasoning about convergence/stability guarantees if available.  Targeting clarity here will strongly raise the foundational confidence in the core mechanism's soundness and potential success during experimentation and real-world integration phases, thus meriting priority attention and resolution before progressing too far into implementation phases or claims of expected impact with low risk assumptions.  This will also help peers accurately judge the novelty and technical contribution relative to competitive prior arts noted in the novelty pre-screening stage, reducing risk of overstated claims or unforeseen failure modes in complex multimodal clinical AI pipelines.  Overall, this feedback urges refining the proposed mechanism expository rigor, providing technical specificity, and addressing joint training challenges upfront for soundness assurance and smoother downstream development lifecycle processes, thereby maximizing feasibility and impact chances downstream by design.  \n\n(Section: Proposed_Method)  \n"

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty pre-assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the core idea involving adaptive compression for multimodal medical LLMs, the project can strategically enhance impact and originality by integrating concepts from 'federated learning' and 'hyper-parameter optimization' within the adaptive compression pipeline. Specifically, exploring federated learning paradigms to collaboratively train compression modules across distributed healthcare sites without sharing sensitive patient data can expand deployment feasibility in privacy-constrained low-resource environments. Concurrently, applying hyper-parameter optimization or even AutoML techniques to dynamically tune compression parameters per site or modality can further boost performance tailoring beyond manually designed adaptive heuristics. This layered approach would differentiate the work from existing learned compression and multimodal fusion pipelines by jointly addressing privacy, adaptability, and computational efficiency in real-world heterogeneous medical settings. Including these globally-linked concepts would deepen the novelty, broaden the translational impact, and better position the research as a flagship contribution at the intersection of compressive multimodal AI and privacy-preserving federated medical ML, aligning with current cutting-edge trends and unmet clinical deployment needs. This strategic augmentation aligns well with the proposed fallback options exploring customized compressors and hardware-aware quantization, consolidating robustness and adaptability advantages. Consider embedding federated training protocols and automated per-site compression tuning into the experiment plan and method design phases to fully realize these synergistic benefits and elevate the project's competitive standing and community relevance.
