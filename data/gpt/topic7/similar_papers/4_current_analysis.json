However, their high computational demands result in significant environmental impacts, particularly in terms of energy and water consumption. This paper addresses these issues by proposing an innovative compression approach to reducing LLM sizes. We focus on compressing the internal transformer layers, which are critical contributors to LLMs’ computational complexity. Our approach combines new mathematical and structural key methods for model compression. We begin by applying Forward Propagation Pruning (FPP) to compress the embedding and feed-forward layers, utilizing a weight freezing and zeroing technique for suspected unused parameters. This reduces the number of trainable parameters, accelerating the overall training process and enabling faster convergence. Second, the Weight Matrix Folding method is introduced to efficiently prune the self-attention layer matrices in a simple and efficient mathematical model. This method integrates Identical Row Compression (IRC) to optimize the compression of the Query and Key matrices, alongside Diagonal Weight Compression (DWC), which reformulates the Value matrix into a diagonal structure. Consequently, this technique significantly diminishes parameter variability across the three metrics, enhancing consistency and performance while simplifying complexity. The compression approach is evaluated on three language modeling datasets and eight widely used classification datasets, comparing it to various pruning methods. Our method successfully compresses transformer layers by 99% and linear layers by 70%, resulting in an overall model compression of around 70%, while maintaining nearly the same accuracy. Notably, with moderate compression rates of 20% to 40%, model performance not only remained stable but even improved. This leads to substantial reductions in memory usage and computational demands, making LLMs more resource-efficient and highlighting the potential to optimize them for a more sustainable AI future.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Building Flexible, Scalable, and Machine Learning-Ready Multimodal Oncology Datasets', 'abstract': \"The advancements in data acquisition, storage, and processing techniques have resulted in the rapid growth of heterogeneous medical data. Integrating radiological scans, histopathology images, and molecular information with clinical data is essential for developing a holistic understanding of the disease and optimizing treatment. The need for integrating data from multiple sources is further pronounced in complex diseases such as cancer for enabling precision medicine and personalized treatments. This work proposes Multimodal Integration of Oncology Data System (MINDS)-a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective metadata framework for efficiently fusing disparate data from public sources such as the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) into an interconnected, patient-centric framework. MINDS consolidates over 41,000 cases from across repositories while achieving a high compression ratio relative to the 3.78 PB source data size. It offers sub-5-s query response times for interactive exploration. MINDS offers an interface for exploring relationships across data types and building cohorts for developing large-scale multimodal machine learning models. By harmonizing multimodal data, MINDS aims to potentially empower researchers with greater analytical ability to uncover diagnostic and prognostic insights and enable evidence-based personalized care. MINDS tracks granular end-to-end data provenance, ensuring reproducibility and transparency. The cloud-native architecture of MINDS can handle exponential data growth in a secure, cost-optimized manner while ensuring substantial storage optimization, replication avoidance, and dynamic access capabilities. Auto-scaling, access controls, and other mechanisms guarantee pipelines' scalability and security. MINDS overcomes the limitations of existing biomedical data silos via an interoperable metadata-driven approach that represents a pivotal step toward the future of oncology data integration.\"}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Generative AI and LLMs for Critical Infrastructure Protection: Evaluation Benchmarks, Agentic AI, Challenges, and Opportunities', 'abstract': 'Critical National Infrastructures (CNIs)-including energy grids, water systems, transportation networks, and communication frameworks-are essential to modern society yet face escalating cybersecurity threats.
