    "title": "Collaborative Bias Auditing and Transparency Toolkits for Clinician-Patient Co-Designed LLM Interfaces",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM clinical support systems lack transparency mechanisms co-designed with both clinicians and patients to effectively mitigate bias and foster equitable healthcare AI usage.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical siloing identified between co-design and clinician-patient interactions (Internal Gaps) and targets Opportunity 2 to collaboratively develop bias mitigation and transparency tools that are context-aware and aligned with stakeholder needs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an interactive bias auditing toolkit within clinical LLM interfaces co-designed via multi-stakeholder workshops. The toolkit visualizes AI decision rationales, surfaces provenance of outputs, and highlights potential bias flags contextualized to patient demographics. This interface is augmented by explainable AI modules customized to clinician and patient literacy levels, enabling co-learning and bias reduction in real-time support scenarios.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multi-modal datasets including clinician notes, patient demographics, and AI output rationales; 2. Develop baseline LLM clinical support without transparency aids; 3. Conduct co-design workshops to shape toolkit functionalities and UI/UX; 4. Integrate explainability and bias detection modules into LLM APIs; 5. Evaluate impact through controlled user studies measuring bias perception, trust, and decision accuracy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM suggests medication alternative for Patient C who belongs to an underserved minority group. Toolkit highlights bias flags indicating underrepresentation in training data and shows explanation for suggestion. Expected Output: Clinician identifies potential bias, adjusts recommendation accordingly, and patient is more informed and trusts the AI support.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time bias detection is challenging, implement post-hoc transparency reports; if user studies indicate UI complexity is a barrier, apply iterative simplifications focusing on core bias insights."

        "title": "Privacy-Preserving, Role-Aware Collaborative Bias Auditing Toolkits for Clinician-Patient Co-Designed LLM Interfaces in Healthcare",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM-based clinical support systems often lack transparent, privacy-conscious mechanisms co-designed with clinicians and patients to mitigate bias and foster equitable, trustworthy AI usage. Additionally, existing tools insufficiently integrate role-based access controls and human-AI interaction design principles to tailor transparency and explanations according to diverse user roles and patient consent constraints, limiting usability and ethical compliance across varied healthcare settings.",
        "Motivation": "Building upon prior work in bias auditing in clinical AI, this project addresses the NOV-COMPETITIVE landscape by innovatively integrating privacy-preserving, role-based access control (RBAC) methods and advanced human-AI interaction design into co-designed LLM interfaces. By explicitly aligning with international health system standards and involving diverse clinical environments, this research advances the state-of-the-art in clinical AI transparency toolkits. It moves beyond generic explainability to a context-aware, ethically-grounded solution that manages sensitive information and adapts transparency dynamically based on user trust levels and regulatory requirements, enhancing adoption, equity, and practical impact.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a modular, interactive bias auditing and transparency toolkit embedded within clinical LLM interfaces, co-designed through multi-stakeholder workshops involving clinicians, patients, ethicists, and system administrators. Key innovations include: (1) integration of attribute-based and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanisms to customize bias visualizations, AI decision rationales, and explanations according to clinician roles, patient consents, and trust levels; (2) incorporation of privacy-preserving methods to safeguard sensitive data during bias detection and explanation generation; (3) embedding Named Entity Recognition (NER) for sensitive information identification and dynamic masking aligned with privacy policies; (4) adherence to international health system standards and piloting across diverse clinical settings, including underserved sites such as the University Clinics of Kinshasa, to ensure global applicability; (5) rigorous application of human-AI interaction design principles to optimize UI/UX tailored for clinician and patient literacy and cultural contexts. This approach fosters equitable co-learning and bias mitigation while proactively managing ethical and privacy challenges.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Secure Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals and data sharing agreements with diverse clinical partners, including international sites (e.g., University Clinics of Kinshasa), emphasizing privacy and ethical compliance. Timeline: Months 0-3.\n2. Collect and preprocess multimodal datasets (clinician notes, patient demographics, AI output rationales) with privacy-preserving transformations and NER-based sensitive information tagging. Timeline: Months 2-6.\n3. Develop a baseline LLM clinical support interface without bias auditing or transparency features. Timeline: Months 4-7.\n4. Conduct iterative multi-stakeholder co-design workshops to identify role-specific transparency needs, consent preferences, and interface requirements, incorporating human-AI interaction design insights. Timeline: Months 5-9.\n5. Architect and implement the bias auditing toolkit integrated with modular RBAC and privacy-preserving mechanisms, coupled with explainability modules customized per user role and literacy level. Timeline: Months 8-12.\n6. Pilot deployment with a narrow clinical domain focused on specific biases (e.g., medication recommendations for underserved populations) in selected sites to verify workflow integration and system usability. Timeline: Months 12-15.\n7. Execute controlled user studies measuring impact on bias perception, trust, decision accuracy, and privacy compliance; collect feedback for iterative refinement. Timeline: Months 15-18.\n8. Develop fallback protocols including post-hoc privacy-respecting transparency reports and alternative UI simplifications to address integration or acceptance barriers.\nThroughout, include detailed risk mitigation for data access, privacy challenges, and ethical concerns, with clear milestones and contingency plans to ensure scientific rigor and operational feasibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: An LLM recommends a medication alternative for Patient C, an underserved minority with specific comorbidities. The toolkit, respecting patient consent and clinician role (e.g., attending physician vs. nurse), dynamically reveals bias flags indicating potential underrepresentation in training data and provides explanations tailored to the clinician's expertise level.\n\nExpected Output: The clinician, alerted by role-specific bias visualizations and privacy-preserving transparency disclosures, identifies possible bias impacts, adjusts the recommendation accordingly, and effectively communicates with Patient C, who receives explanations respecting their consent and literacy level, thereby increasing trust in AI assistance.\n\nAdditional Test: Validating that sensitive information (e.g., patient identifiers) is automatically detected and masked via NER modules, ensuring privacy preservation across all user interfaces.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time role-based bias detection and privacy mechanisms prove too complex or resource-intensive, implement a tiered fallback comprising scheduled, privacy-compliant post-hoc transparency and bias audit reports accessible according to RBAC policies. If pilot user studies reveal interface complexity or usability hurdles, iterate UI simplifications focusing on core bias insights personalized by user role, and enhance training materials based on feedback. Contingency plans include narrowing clinical domains further or focusing on synthetic data for early-stage testing to mitigate data access barriers, ensuring continuous progress towards deployment readiness and rigorous evaluation."

Moreover, co-design workshops with multiple stakeholders and controlled user studies involving sensitive clinical environments require extensive ethical review and recruitment efforts which should be explicitly acknowledged and planned for. To improve feasibility, the plan should include clear milestones, risk mitigation strategies for data access and privacy concerns, and contingency protocols if initial modules fail to integrate as expected in clinical workflows. Additionally, consider piloting with a narrower clinical domain or specific biases before scaling up to ensure iterative refinement and practical deployment readiness. This will strengthen confidence in the stepwise approach and eventual impact evaluation outcomes within realistic resource constraints and regulatory landscapes, increasing overall project feasibility and scientific rigor in execution planning.\n\nSuggested Action: Include detailed timelines, data privacy and IRB considerations, incremental deployment phases, and fallback mechanisms beyond UI simplifications to anticipate implementation challenges early on, enhancing operational feasibility and scientific soundness of the experiment plan.  \n\n [FEA-EXPERIMENT]  (Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)  "

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating, the project could gain substantial value and increased impact by integrating related concepts like 'medical AI systems', 'human-AI interaction design', and 'privacy-preserving methods' explicitly into the toolkit design. For example, incorporating attribute-based or role-based access controls (e.g., RBAC) could enrich the transparency toolkit by tailoring bias audit visualizations and explanations based on clinician roles or patient consent preferences, enhancing privacy and ethical safeguards. Aligning the toolkit development with international health system standards and involving diverse clinical settings (e.g., University Clinics of Kinshasa) could broaden applicability and global relevance. Additionally, embedding mechanisms to manage sensitive information while accommodating variable user trust levels can improve real-world acceptance and adoption. By proactively connecting with these globally linked themes, the research could differentiate itself with system-level integration that addresses complexity and privacy in healthcare AI, thereby elevating both novelty and potential impact substantially.\n\nSuggested Action: Augment the research scope to explicitly explore and prototype privacy-preserving bias auditing through access control mechanisms and expand user experience customization via human-AI interaction design principles drawn from the referenced global domains.\n\n [SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION]  (Sections: Proposed_Method & Experiment_Plan)"
