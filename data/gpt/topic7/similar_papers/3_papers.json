    "abstract": "Healthcare organizations have realized that Artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a competitive edge through personalized patient experiences, improved patient outcomes, early diagnosis, augmented clinician capabilities, enhanced operational efficiencies, or improved medical service accessibility. However, deploying AI-driven tools in the healthcare ecosystem could be challenging. This paper categorizes AI applications in healthcare and comprehensively examines the challenges associated with deploying AI in medical practices at scale. As AI continues to make strides in healthcare, its integration presents various challenges, including production timelines, trust generation, privacy concerns, algorithmic biases, and data scarcity. The paper highlights that flawed business models and wrong workflows in healthcare practices cannot be rectified merely by deploying AI-driven tools. Healthcare organizations should re-evaluate root problems such as misaligned financial incentives (e.g., fee-for-service models), dysfunctional medical workflows (e.g., high rates of patient readmissions), poor care coordination between different providers, fragmented electronic health records systems, and inadequate patient education and engagement models in tandem with AI adoption. This study also explores the need for a cultural shift in viewing AI not as a threat but as an enabler that can enhance healthcare delivery and create new employment opportunities while emphasizing the importance of addressing underlying operational issues. The necessity of investments beyond finance is discussed, emphasizing the importance of human capital, continuous learning, and a supportive environment for AI integration. The paper also highlights the crucial role of clear regulations in building trust, ensuring safety, and guiding the ethical use of AI, calling for coherent frameworks addressing transparency, model accuracy, data quality control, liability, and ethics. Furthermore, this paper underscores the importance of advancing AI literacy within academia to prepare future healthcare professionals for an AI-driven landscape. Through careful navigation and proactive measures addressing these challenges, the healthcare community can harness AI's transformative power responsibly and effectively, revolutionizing healthcare delivery and patient care. The paper concludes with a vision and strategic suggestions for the future of healthcare with AI, emphasizing thoughtful, responsible, and innovative engagement as the pathway to realizing its full potential to unlock immense benefits for healthcare organizations, physicians, nurses, and patients while proactively mitigating risks.",

    "abstract": "Foundation Models (FMs) are gaining increasing attention in the biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem due to their ability to represent and contextualize multimodal biomedical data. These capabilities make FMs a valuable tool for a variety of tasks, including biomedical reasoning, hypothesis generation, and interpreting complex imaging data. In this review paper, we address the unique challenges associated with establishing an ethical and trustworthy biomedical AI ecosystem, with a particular focus on the development of FMs and their downstream applications. We explore strategies that can be implemented throughout the biomedical AI pipeline to effectively tackle these challenges, ensuring that these FMs are translated responsibly into clinical and translational settings. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of key stewardship and co-design principles that not only ensure robust regulation but also guarantee that the interests of all stakeholders-especially those involved in or affected by these clinical and translational applications-are adequately represented. We aim to empower the biomedical AI community to harness these models responsibly and effectively. As we navigate this exciting frontier, our collective commitment to ethical stewardship, co-design, and responsible translation will be instrumental in ensuring that the evolution of FMs truly enhances patient care and medical decision-making, ultimately leading to a more equitable and trustworthy biomedical AI ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study presents a comprehensive review of the clinical applications, technical challenges, and ethical considerations associated with using large language models (LLMs) in medicine.\nMETHODS: A literature survey of peer-reviewed articles, technical reports, and expert commentary from relevant medical and artificial intelligence journals was conducted. Key clinical application areas, technical limitations (e.g., accuracy, validation, transparency), and ethical issues (e.g., bias, safety, accountability, privacy) were identified and analyzed.\nRESULTS: LLMs have potential in clinical documentation assistance, decision support, patient communication, and workflow optimization. The level of supporting evidence varies; documentation support applications are relatively mature, whereas autonomous diagnostics continue to face notable limitations regarding accuracy and validation. Key technical challenges include model hallucination, lack of robust clinical validation, integration issues, and limited transparency. Ethical concerns involve algorithmic bias risking health inequities, threats to patient safety from inaccuracies, unclear accountability, data privacy, and impacts on clinician-patient interactions.\nCONCLUSIONS: LLMs possess transformative potential for clinical medicine, particularly by augmenting clinician capabilities. However, substantial technical and ethical hurdles necessitate rigorous research, validation, clearly defined guidelines, and human oversight. Existing evidence supports an assistive rather than autonomous role, mandating careful, evidence-based integration that prioritizes patient safety and equity.",

    "abstract": "As digital healthcare evolves, the security of electronic health records (EHR) becomes increasingly crucial. This study presents the GPT-Onto-CAABAC framework, integrating Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT), medical-legal ontologies and Context-Aware Attribute-Based Access Control (CAABAC) to enhance EHR access security. Unlike traditional models, GPT-Onto-CAABAC dynamically interprets policies and adapts to changing healthcare and legal environments, offering customized access control solutions. Through empirical evaluation, this framework is shown to be effective in improving EHR security by accurately aligning access decisions with complex regulatory and situational requirements. The findings suggest its broader applicability in sectors where access control must meet stringent compliance and adaptability standards.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects cognitive abilities including memory, reasoning, and communication skills, leading to gradual decline in daily activities and social engagement. In light of the recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, this paper aims to thoroughly analyse their potential applications and usefulness in dementia care and research.\nMethod: To this end, we offer an introduction into LLMs, outlining the key features, capabilities, limitations, potential risks, and practical considerations for deployment as easy-to-use software (e.g., smartphone apps). We then explore various domains related to dementia, identifying opportunities for LLMs to enhance understanding, diagnostics, and treatment, with a broader emphasis on improving patient care. For each domain, the specific contributions of LLMs are examined, such as their ability to engage users in meaningful conversations, deliver personalized support, and offer cognitive enrichment. Potential benefits encompass improved social interaction, enhanced cognitive functioning, increased emotional well-being, and reduced caregiver burden. The deployment of LLMs in caregiving frameworks also raises a number of concerns and considerations. These include privacy and safety concerns, the need for empirical validation, user-centered design, adaptation to the user's unique needs, and the integration of multimodal inputs to create more immersive and personalized experiences. Additionally, ethical guidelines and privacy protocols must be established to ensure responsible and ethical deployment of LLMs.\nResults: We report the results on a questionnaire filled in by people with dementia (PwD) and their supporters wherein we surveyed the usefulness of different application scenarios of LLMs as well as the features that LLM-powered apps should have. Both PwD and supporters were largely positive regarding the prospect of LLMs in care, although concerns were raised regarding bias, data privacy and transparency.\nDiscussion: Overall, this review corroborates the promising utilization of LLMs to positively impact dementia care by boosting cognitive abilities, enriching social interaction, and supporting caregivers. The findings underscore the importance of further research and development in this field to fully harness the benefits of LLMs and maximize their potential for improving the lives of individuals living with dementia.",

    "abstract": "A large language model (LLM), in the context of natural language processing and artificial intelligence, refers to a sophisticated neural network that has been trained on a massive amount of text data to understand and generate human-like language. These models are typically built on architectures like transformers. The term “large” indicates that the neural network has a significant number of parameters, making it more powerful and capable of capturing complex patterns in language. One notable example of a large language model is ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like text. It can be trained on a variety of tasks, such as language translation, question answering, and text completion. One of the key features of ChatGPT is its ability to understand and respond to natural language inputs. This makes it a powerful tool for generating a wide range of text, including medical reports, surgical notes, and even poetry. Additionally, the model has been trained on a large corpus of text, which allows it to generate text that is both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. In terms of applications in neurosurgery, ChatGPT can be used to generate detailed and accurate surgical reports, which can be very useful for sharing information about a patient’s case with other members of the medical team. Additionally, the model can be used to generate detailed surgical notes, which can be very useful for training and educating residents and medical students. Overall, LLMs have the potential to be a valuable tool in the field of neurosurgery. Indeed, this abstract has been generated by ChatGPT within few seconds. Potential applications and pitfalls of the applications of LLMs are discussed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) continue to exhibit noteworthy capabilities across a spectrum of areas, including emerging proficiencies across the health care continuum. Successful LLM implementation and adoption depend on digital readiness, modern infrastructure, a trained workforce, privacy, and an ethical regulatory landscape. These factors can vary significantly across health care ecosystems, dictating the choice of a particular LLM implementation pathway. This perspective discusses 3 LLM implementation pathways-training from scratch pathway (TSP), fine-tuned pathway (FTP), and out-of-the-box pathway (OBP)-as potential onboarding points for health systems while facilitating equitable adoption. The choice of a particular pathway is governed by needs as well as affordability. Therefore, the risks, benefits, and economics of these pathways across 4 major cloud service providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle) are presented. While cost comparisons, such as on-demand and spot pricing across the cloud service providers for the 3 pathways, are presented for completeness, the usefulness of managed services and cloud enterprise tools is elucidated. Managed services can complement the traditional workforce and expertise, while enterprise tools, such as federated learning, can overcome sample size challenges when implementing LLMs using health care data. Of the 3 pathways, TSP is expected to be the most resource-intensive regarding infrastructure and workforce while providing maximum customization, enhanced transparency, and performance. Because TSP trains the LLM using enterprise health care data, it is expected to harness the digital signatures of the population served by the health care system with the potential to impact outcomes. The use of pretrained models in FTP is a limitation. It may impact its performance because the training data used in the pretrained model may have hidden bias and may not necessarily be health care-related. However, FTP provides a balance between customization, cost, and performance. While OBP can be rapidly deployed, it provides minimal customization and transparency without guaranteeing long-term availability. OBP may also present challenges in interfacing seamlessly with downstream applications in health care settings with variations in pricing and use over time. Lack of customization in OBP can significantly limit its ability to impact outcomes. Finally, potential applications of LLMs in health care, including conversational artificial intelligence, chatbots, summarization, and machine translation, are highlighted. While the 3 implementation pathways discussed in this perspective have the potential to facilitate equitable adoption and democratization of LLMs, transitions between them may be necessary as the needs of health systems evolve. Understanding the economics and trade-offs of these onboarding pathways can guide their strategic adoption and demonstrate value while impacting health care outcomes favorably.",

    "abstract": "Our interdisciplinary study examines the effectiveness of US law in addressing the complex challenges posed by generative AI systems to fundamental human values, including physical and mental well-being, privacy, autonomy, diversity, and equity. Through the analysis of diverse hypothetical scenarios developed in collaboration with experts, we identified significant shortcomings and ambiguities within the existing legal protections. Constitutional and civil rights law currently struggles to hold AI companies responsible for AI-assisted discriminatory outputs. Moreover, even without considering the liability shield provided by Section 230, existing liability laws may not effectively remedy unintentional and intangible harms caused by AI systems. Demonstrating causal links for liability claims such as defamation or product liability proves exceptionally difficult due to the intricate and opaque nature of these systems. To effectively address these unique and evolving risks posed by generative AI, we propose a “Responsible AI Legal Framework”  that adapts to recognize new threats and utilizes a multi-pronged approach. This framework would enshrine fundamental values in legal frameworks, establish comprehensive safety guidelines, and implement liability models tailored to the complexities of human-AI interactions. By proactively mitigating unforeseen harms like mental health impacts and privacy breaches, this framework aims to create a legal landscape capable of navigating the exciting yet precarious future brought forth by generative AI technologies.",

    "abstract": "Upon a diagnosis, the clinical team faces two main questions: what treatment, and at what dose? Clinical trials' results provide the basis for guidance and support for official protocols that clinicians use to base their decisions. However, individuals do not consistently demonstrate the reported response from relevant clinical trials. The decision complexity increases with combination treatments where drugs administered together can interact with each other, which is often the case. Additionally, the individual's response to the treatment varies with the changes in their condition. In practice, the drug and the dose selection depend significantly on the medical protocol and the medical team's experience. As such, the results are inherently varied and often suboptimal. Big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have emerged as excellent decision-making tools, but multiple challenges limit their application. AI is a rapidly evolving and dynamic field with the potential to revolutionize various aspects of human life. AI has become increasingly crucial in drug discovery and development. AI enhances decision-making across different disciplines, such as medicinal chemistry, molecular and cell biology, pharmacology, pathology, and clinical practice. In addition to these, AI contributes to patient population selection and stratification. The need for AI in healthcare is evident as it aids in enhancing data accuracy and ensuring the quality care necessary for effective patient treatment. AI is pivotal in improving success rates in clinical practice. The increasing significance of AI in drug discovery, development, and clinical trials is underscored by many scientific publications. Despite the numerous advantages of AI, such as enhancing and advancing Precision Medicine (PM) and remote patient monitoring, unlocking its full potential in healthcare requires addressing fundamental concerns. These concerns include data quality, the lack of well-annotated large datasets, data privacy and safety issues, biases in AI algorithms, legal and ethical challenges, and obstacles related to cost and implementation. Nevertheless, integrating AI in clinical medicine will improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes, contribute to more efficient healthcare delivery, reduce costs, and facilitate better patient experiences, making healthcare more sustainable. This article reviews AI applications in drug development and clinical practice, making healthcare more sustainable, and highlights concerns and limitations in applying AI.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of artificial-intelligence (AI), as applied to dermatology. We focus our discussion on methodology, AI applications for various skin diseases, limitations, and future opportunities. We review how the current image-based models are being implemented in dermatology across disease subsets, and highlight the challenges facing widespread adoption. Additionally, we discuss how the future of AI in dermatology might evolve and the emerging paradigm of large language, and multi-modal models to emphasize the importance of developing responsible, fair, and equitable models in dermatology.",
