          "feedback_content": "While the proposed method outlines domain adaptation and adversarial training to align academic clinical NLP models with regulatory text corpora, the mechanism for how adversarial loss concretely enforces regulatory compliance in benchmark evaluation is insufficiently detailed. Clarify how the adversarial training objectives will capture regulatory standards and constraints beyond mere distribution alignment, and outline how evaluation criteria explicitly model regulatory expectations to ensure soundness of compliance claims. Without this, the mechanism risks being a domain alignment heuristic without strong grounding in regulatory validation needs, which is central to the problem statement's claim of regulatory compliance benchmarking validity and replicability, so strengthening this link is critical to the research soundness and high-impact relevance of the approach. This should also be reflected in the evaluation metrics design and the experiment plan's validation stages to demonstrate compliance explicitly, not just improved domain distribution matching or benchmark scoring improvements on regulatory text datasets alone. Thus, the method's soundness and eventual impact hinge on clarifying and operationalizing these mechanisms in depth, beyond a high-level outline currently provided in the Proposed_Method section and Experiment_Plan.  \n\nRecommendation: Provide detailed algorithmic design or pseudo-code snippets, example loss terms explicitly encoding regulatory criteria, and a clear description of how compliance-focused benchmark validation is measured and enforced through model adaptation steps including adversarial objectives. This will strengthen the rationale and technical feasibility of the claimed contributions and ensure positive reviewer confidence in the method's soundness and application to regulatory contexts in clinical NLP benchmarking, which is the core innovation focus of the study. This is foundational to justify follow-up experimental and impact claims and validate the design choices in adapting LLM benchmarks from academic to regulatory domains robustly and reproducibly as stated in the Problem_Statement and Motivation sections.  \n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the globally-linked concepts available, the research idea could be significantly enhanced by integrating privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy or federated learning (FL) systems into the cross-domain transfer learning pipeline. Clinical and regulatory data are privacy-sensitive, and embedding differential privacy mechanisms or adopting federated learning frameworks would address real-world constraints around data access and sharing, which are often critical in clinical pipelines and regulatory environments. This integration would provide a competitive edge by tackling both regulatory compliance and privacy concerns in one cohesive frameworkâ€”expanding the impact and novelty scope substantially beyond domain adaptation alone. \n\nConcrete suggestions include:  \n- Adapting adversarial domain adaptation methods to operate under differential privacy guarantees, ensuring model updates and evaluations do not leak sensitive information from regulatory or clinical corpora.  \n- Exploring multi-task learning that jointly optimizes for regulatory compliance and privacy preservation metrics, potentially through federated learning over multi-institutional regulatory datasets.  \n- Incorporating privacy-accuracy trade-off analysis as part of benchmark evaluations to quantify compliance and utility simultaneously.\n\nThis integration will directly strengthen the feasibility and impact of the approach on clinical NLP pipelines where privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) are as important as regulatory compliance, aligning with both academic novelty and practical deployment constraints. It may also open pathways for downstream decision support system use cases and broaden clinical trial NLP validations, addressing the IMP-BROADEN_IMPACT dimension as well. \n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"
