    "title": "Digital Twin-based Synthetic Data Generation for LLM Training and Evaluation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Lack of realistic, dynamic data representing real-world production complexities impairs LLM training and replicability evaluations.",
    "Motivation": "Builds on external gap of integrating urban digital twin systems (Opportunity 2) by proposing synthetic data generation guided by digital twin simulations, to improve model generalization and replicability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Utilize urban digital twin simulations to generate synthetic multimodal textual and sensor data reflecting realistic environmental and user interactions. This synthetic data augments standard training sets, and is used to rigorously evaluate LLM replicability across evolving and complex scenarios not covered by static benchmarks.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop synthetic data pipelines interfacing with digital twin simulation outputs. 2) Train LLMs with augmented datasets including synthetic scenarios. 3) Design replicability evaluation tests on synthetic and real-world mixed inputs. 4) Compare performance to baseline training without synthetic data. 5) Study effects on downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and context-aware reasoning.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Synthetic emergency communication streams generated from a simulated urban disaster scenario. Expected output: LLM reliably interprets and prioritizes information with replicable accuracy across repeated simulation runs.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If synthetic data quality limits improvements, fallback includes refinement of simulation parameters or semi-synthetic data blending real and synthetic inputs to smooth distribution gaps."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method suggests using urban digital twin simulations to generate synthetic multimodal data for LLM training and evaluation, but it lacks detail on how textual data and sensor data will be coherently integrated and represented for effective LLM consumption. Clarify the pipeline translating simulation outputs into LLM training examples, detailing modalities, annotation procedures, and alignment with LLM input formats to ensure this method is actionable and reproducible. Without this clarity, the mechanism risks being underspecified, threatening both soundness and practical implementation success, especially given the complexity of urban digital twin outputs and LLM tokenization needs. This should be addressed by including concrete data generation and integration workflows and sample schemas for multimodal input representation targeting LLM architectures, which will also ease later evaluation steps and increase confidence in the approach's feasibility and validity. This issue is central to validating core assumptions of effective synthetic data enrichment for LLM training and evaluation, thus highly critical to address first in revision efforts.  Target Section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty verdict and the existing integration of digital twins and LLM development, the proposal could significantly strengthen its impact and differentiate itself by integrating concepts from graph neural networks and edge-cloud collaborative computing. Specifically, modeling urban entities and interactions as dynamic graphs processed via graph neural networks could enhance the fidelity and expressiveness of synthetic data generated from digital twins. Further, leveraging edge-cloud collaborative infrastructures to distribute synthetic data generation and LLM fine-tuning in real-time can simulate realistic latency and resource constraints seen in production environments, improving replicability evaluation. This integration would augment the scientific novelty and practical relevance, addressing complex dependencies and deployment scenarios in urban contexts and making the contribution more competitive compared to current baseline approaches limited to static or isolated data modalities. Hence, a focused extension incorporating these linked concepts is recommended to escalate the work’s novelty and broaden impact. Target Section: Proposed_Method"
