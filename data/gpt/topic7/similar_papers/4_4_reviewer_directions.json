    "title": "Multimodal Learned Compression and Federated Distillation for Robust Resource-Constrained LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current compression methods and federated learning frameworks inadequately address the challenge of integrating multimodal medical data while ensuring replicable LLM performance under tight computational and communication constraints.",
    "Motivation": "This work synthesizes the gaps on federated learning with heterogeneous data and image/video compression by proposing a federated knowledge distillation framework with learned multimodal compression, enabling robust, lightweight LLMs for cross-domain clinical deployment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a federation of client models that locally compress multimodal inputs (images, text, metadata) through parameter-efficient learned codecs. Clients then perform knowledge distillation to a compact student LLM trained via communication-efficient averaged logits rather than full weights. Introduce modality-specific distillation losses ensuring consistency. The central server aggregates distilled knowledge to update a global lightweight LLM, facilitating deployment in low-resource clinical environments while preserving domain-generalization and fairness.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use federated datasets with multimodal medical data (e.g., MIMIC III, NIH Chest X-rays).\n2. Establish compression baselines.\n3. Train client models with learned compression.\n4. Implement logit-based federated distillation.\n5. Measure model accuracy, size reduction, communication overhead, and cross-site generalization.\n6. Evaluate fairness and bias metrics.\n7. Test integration with real-world clinical decision support tools.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient textual history and X-ray images from multiple hospitals.\nExpected output: Compressed multimodal embeddings locally analyzed, distilled outputs shared with central server.\nGlobal distilled model achieves >60% compression with preserved diagnostic accuracy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If distillation causes performance degradation, explore hybrid weight-logit aggregation. Enhance modality-specific compression with additional modality-aware regularizers. Introduce server-side augmentation for robustness."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines federated knowledge distillation using learned multimodal compression but lacks clarity on how modality-specific distillation losses are formulated and optimized. It should explicitly describe the architecture of the parameter-efficient learned codecs for each modality and detail the integration strategy ensuring the student LLM maintains cross-modal consistency post-distillation. Clarifying these mechanisms will strengthen confidence in the method's soundness and reproducibility, particularly under noisy real-world medical data conditions common in federated scenarios, thus mitigating risks of degradation due to heterogeneous client distributions or modality imbalances. Consider providing algorithmic pseudocode or detailed workflow diagrams for key steps such as compression, distillation loss computation, and server aggregation to enhance technical clarity and soundness of the approach in this challenging multimodal federated setting, especially given the complexity of clinical data modalities involved in downstream decision support applications. This will also facilitate solid experimental validation of the core assumptions originally presented in the Problem_Statement section regarding replicable LLM performance under resource constraints with multimodal inputs in federated learning contexts. Targeting this feedback first will improve the proposal’s technical depth and increase its chances of successful implementation and evaluation in experimental phases.

          "feedback_content": "While the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan covers key stages from dataset selection to fairness evaluation, it would benefit from increased practical detail and prioritization to enhance feasibility. For example, the plan should specify the exact federated learning simulation setup (number of clients, communication rounds, realistic network conditions) to realistically capture resource constraints. It should also clarify the selection and design of baselines, emphasizing comparisons with state-of-the-art multimodal federated or learned compression methods. Furthermore, early-stage ablation studies or pilot experiments focusing on single-modality compression before full multimodal fusion could improve developmental feasibility. Explicit consideration of privacy and security measures during federated distillation, especially in clinical data contexts, is critical and currently overlooked. Additionally, the plan should define quantitative success criteria for compression ratio, accuracy retention, communication overhead, and fairness metrics with clear thresholds to guide iterative development. Addressing these points will help ensure the proposed experiments are scientifically rigorous, practically executable, and adequately capture the complex interplay between model compression, multimodal data, and federated learning under clinical deployment constraints. This strengthened experimental plan will substantially increase the proposal’s reliability and demonstrate feasibility to reviewers and potential clinical collaborators.
