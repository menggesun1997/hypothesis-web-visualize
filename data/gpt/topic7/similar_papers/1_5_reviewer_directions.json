    "title": "Prompt Engineering-based Defensive Framework to Harden LLM Replicability",
    "Problem_Statement": "Adversarial users can exploit prompt vulnerabilities, causing inconsistent or erroneous LLM behavior in production, yet systematic defenses are lacking.",
    "Motivation": "Directly leverages prompt engineering advances (Opportunity 1) to construct a defensive prompt framework that secures replicability against prompt-based adversarial exploitation, filling an internal-external gap.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create a suite of adaptive defensive prompt rewriters that detect and neutralize adversarial intents or malformed prompts. The system applies prompt perturbation invariance checks, semantic consistency validations, and input sanitization layers dynamically before model invocation, ensuring stable and replicable outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate adversarial prompt datasets from social and malicious use cases. 2) Develop prompt rewriting and sanitization algorithms. 3) Evaluate defense effectiveness on LLM benchmarks measuring output stability pre- and post-defense. 4) Assess trade-offs in latency and usability. 5) Extend testing to cross-domain LLM deployments.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A subtle prompt injection aiming to trigger biased or harmful LLM output. Expected output: Defensive framework rewrites the prompt to neutralize adversarial payload, producing consistent and safe LLM responses.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If automatic rewriting impairs legitimate prompt functionality, fallback mechanisms include human-in-the-loop verification or layered trust scoring for prompts guiding selective rewriting."

          "feedback_content": "While the Proposed_Method outlines the use of adaptive prompt rewriters with perturbation invariance checks, semantic consistency validations, and input sanitization, the explanation lacks clear detail on how adversarial intents will be effectively detected and neutralized in diverse prompt contexts. Clarify the underlying detection algorithms and how the dynamic application ensures both robustness and minimal degradation of benign prompt functionality to strengthen the method’s soundness and reproducibility potential. Specific mechanisms or illustrative technical workflows would greatly improve clarity and confidence in the approach's feasibility and effectiveness (e.g., how semantic consistency scores are computed and thresholded). This clarity is essential as prompt rewriting in adversarial settings can be nuanced and error-prone, impacting replicability outcomes significantly, thus addressing [SOU-MECHANISM]. The fallback plan hints at complexity in managing erroneous rewrites but doesn't fully compensate for this ambiguity in the main method description, heightening the need for clearer articulation here in Proposed_Method.  \n\nAdditionally, discuss how the framework adapts to evolving attack techniques and if there are mechanisms to update or learn from new adversarial prompt patterns over time, avoiding static defense limitations."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating and to substantially increase the idea’s impact and novelty, consider integrating taxonomy of security and state-of-the-art defense mechanisms from related domains such as communication networks and cognitive computing. This could include modeling prompt adversarial attacks using attack simulations frameworks traditionally applied in network security or privacy leakage studies to create a principled evaluation taxonomy and facilitate standardized benchmark design. \n\nMoreover, situating the defense framework within the deployment of intelligent agents, especially those operating in multi-agent or continuous learning environments, would broaden impact by addressing not only one-shot replicability but ongoing security in dynamic settings. Incorporating insights from AI-generated content authenticity and artificial general intelligence safety could position the research as foundational for robust LLM deployment in broader AI ecosystems, enhancing both scientific and practical relevance. \n\nExplicitly linking this work with these global concepts and leveraging cross-disciplinary methodologies would help differentiate it from competitive existing solutions and unlock new avenues for scholarly contributions and industrial deployment."
