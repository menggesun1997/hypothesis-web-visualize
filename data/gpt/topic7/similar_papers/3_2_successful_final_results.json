    "Problem_Statement": "LLM training pipelines on large healthcare corpora seldom incorporate continuous feedback from stakeholders, limiting fairness, replicability, and relevance of deployed models.",
    "Motivation": "This project answers the External Gap related to co-evolving health data and LLM training through co-design frameworks (Opportunity 3), introducing a paradigm where model training and stakeholder insights evolve in tandem.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a co-evolutionary training pipeline that integrates iterative feedback loops from clinicians and patients into data curation, model fine-tuning, and evaluation stages. Using active learning and dynamic data augmentation powered by co-design insights, the pipeline adjusts both training corpora and model parameters continuously. Cloud infrastructure facilitates scalable, transparent retraining cycles to maintain bias-aware and clinically valid LLM deployment.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Deploy baseline LLM trained on standard biomedical corpora; 2. Establish interfaces for clinicians/patients to provide qualitative and quantitative feedback; 3. Implement active learning modules to reweight or augment training data; 4. Periodically retrain/fine-tune LLM and evaluate via fairness metrics, clinical validity, and replicability benchmarks; 5. Compare iterative pipeline with static training approach.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient group feedback indicates LLM underperforms in representing symptoms common in their demographics; pipeline augments corpus with targeted documents and re-trains to reduce bias. Expected Output: Post-retraining evaluation shows improved fairness scores and symptom representation accuracy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If continuous retraining is computationally infeasible, employ proxy update cycles or distillation methods; if stakeholder feedback lacks consistency, supplement with synthetic bias correction techniques."

        "title": "Federated Co-Evolutionary Training Pipelines Incorporating Dynamic Stakeholder Feedback to Mitigate LLM Bias in Healthcare",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large language model (LLM) training pipelines utilizing extensive healthcare corpora rarely incorporate continuous, real-time feedback from diverse stakeholders, limiting fairness, replicability, clinical relevance, and generalizability across institutions. Additionally, centralized data aggregation for model refinement imposes privacy risks and regulatory challenges.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the External Gap in co-evolving health datasets and LLM training through collaborative design, this project pioneers a federated co-evolutionary training framework that balances privacy, scalability, and bias mitigation. By integrating federated learning techniques with iterative stakeholder feedback loops from clinicians and patients across distributed clinical sites, the approach advances beyond static centralized pipelines and enables adaptive, privacy-preserving model refinement. This novel combination promotes heterogeneous bias awareness, regulatory alignment (e.g., AI Act), and broad applicability, marking a significant progression in responsible healthcare LLM deployment (Opportunity 3).",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a federated co-evolutionary training pipeline where multiple healthcare institutions independently collect and curate domain-specific data and stakeholder feedback while collaboratively refining LLMs without exposing sensitive data. The system integrates federated active learning modules that ingest qualitative and quantitative clinician and patient inputs locally to inform dynamic data augmentation and model fine-tuning. Periodic aggregation via secure federated averaging reconciles local model updates to maintain a globally bias-aware, clinically valid model. Additionally, federated evaluation metrics assess fairness, clinical validity, and replicability across diverse sites. Noise-robust feedback filtering strategies and retraining frequency protocols maintain computational feasibility and stakeholder input quality. Cloud-based orchestration facilitates scalable, transparent retraining cycles under privacy and regulatory constraints, ensuring continuous bias mitigation while respecting heterogeneous clinical requirements.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Deploy baseline LLM independently at multiple participating healthcare sites, each using standard biomedical corpora localized to their patient populations.\n2. Implement federated interfaces enabling clinicians and patients at each site to provide structured qualitative and quantitative feedback on LLM outputs.\n3. Incorporate noise-robust filtering algorithms locally to manage variability and inconsistencies in stakeholder feedback.\n4. Establish clear retraining schedules balancing resource constraints and clinical urgency, e.g., monthly retraining cycles with fallback proxy updates as needed.\n5. Integrate federated active learning modules to adaptively reweight or augment training data and update local model parameters.\n6. Perform secure federated aggregation of model updates and federated evaluation of fairness, replicability, and clinical relevance metrics.\n7. Compare the federated co-evolutionary pipelineâ€™s bias mitigation effectiveness, scalability, and resource efficiency against a centralized static training baseline.\n8. Conduct ablation studies on retraining frequency policies, noise-handling strategies, and federated architectural components.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Across several hospitals, patient advocacy groups report that the LLM insufficiently represents symptoms prevalent in specific demographic groups unique to each institution. Locally, the pipeline augments corpora with targeted documents and adjusts model parameters through federated updates.\nExpected Output: Post-federated retraining evaluations show statistically significant improvements in fairness scores and symptom representation accuracy at each site, while preserving overall model performance and complying with data privacy norms.\nAdditional Scenario: When stakeholder feedback quality at one site degrades (e.g., becomes noisy or sparse), the noise-robust filtering triggers fallback proxy updates, maintaining stable performance without overfitting to spurious signals.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If continuous federated retraining cycles become computationally infeasible, implement proxy periodic updates using distilled models shared across sites to reduce communication costs. If federated stakeholder feedback lacks consistency or volume at certain institutions, supplement local data with synthetic bias correction methods or simulate representative feedback to maintain robustness. In cases where privacy or regulatory constraints intensify, explore hybrid architectures combining federated learning with secure multiparty computation or differential privacy guarantees to ensure compliance without sacrificing model adaptability."

The plan should elaborate on how often retraining cycles will occur, how feedback quality and variability will be managed, and provide more detailed metrics or validation strategies to ensure consistent improvements. Clarifying these points will strengthen the feasibility assessment and increase confidence in practical deployment in clinical environments where computational resources and time are constrained, and stakeholder input can be noisy or sparse.\n\nSuggested improvements include defining clear retraining frequency policies, robust noise-handling methods for feedback, and fallback thresholds for pipeline intervention to maintain feasibility without compromising clinical relevance or bias mitigation goals.\n\nThis enhancement targets improving the scientific soundness and operational practicality of the experiment plan, a critical foundation for the success of the entire pipeline approach (Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)."

Federated learning can enable secure and privacy-preserving aggregation of distributed clinician and patient feedback across multiple institutions without centralizing sensitive data. This would enhance the impact and novelty by addressing realistic constraints in healthcare data sharing and expanding the pipeline's applicability across diverse clinical sites.\n\nIncorporating federated learning into the co-evolutionary pipeline could advance bias mitigation by capturing heterogeneous feedback patterns and training adaptations across decentralized data silos. This integration also aligns with evolving regulations like the AI Act that emphasize data privacy and ethical AI deployment.\n\nConcretely, the proposal could extend the architecture to include federated active learning modules, federated evaluation metrics, and develop protocols for iterative stakeholder feedback under federated constraints, thereby broadening its relevance and leading edge in the competitive LLM fairness research landscape (Suggested enhancement to Proposed_Method and Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)."
