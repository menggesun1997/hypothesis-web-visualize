We synthesize results from existing works to illustrate how diverse knowledge graph structures behave in different data availability settings with distinct application targets in AD research. By comparative analysis, we define the best methodology practices by data type (literature, structured databases, neuroimaging, and clinical records) and application of interest (drug repurposing, disease classification, mechanism discovery, and clinical decision support). From this analysis, we recommend AD-KG 2.0, which is a new framework that coalesces best practices into a unifying architecture with well-defined decision pathways for implementation. Our key contributions are as follows: (1) a dynamic adaptation mechanism that adapts methodological elements automatically according to both data availability and application objectives, (2) a specialized semantic alignment layer that harmonizes terminologies across biological scales, and (3) a multi-constraint optimization approach for knowledge graph building. The framework accommodates a variety of applications, including drug repurposing, patient stratification for precision medicine, disease progression modeling, and clinical decision support. Our system, with a decision tree structured and pipeline layered architecture, offers research precise directions on how to use knowledge graphs in AD research by aligning methodological choice decisions with respective data availability and application goals. We provide precise component designs and adaptation processes that deliver optimal performance across varying research and clinical settings. We conclude by addressing implementation challenges and future directions for translating knowledge graph technologies from research tool to clinical use, with a specific focus on interpretability, workflow integration, and regulatory matters.\"}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Progress in the application of artificial intelligence in molecular generation models based on protein structure', 'abstract': 'The molecular generation models based on protein structures represent a cutting-edge research direction in artificial intelligence-assisted drug discovery.

Data-driven local feature learning methods need to rely on pixel-level correspondence for training. However, a vast number of existing approaches ignored the semantic information on which humans rely to describe image pixels. In addition, it is not feasible to enhance generic scene keypoints detection and description simply by using traditional common semantic segmentation models because they can only recognize a limited number of coarse-grained object classes. In this paper, we propose SAMFeat to introduce SAM (segment anything model), a foundation model trained on 11 million images, as a teacher to guide local feature learning. SAMFeat learns additional semantic information brought by SAM and thus is inspired by higher performance even with limited training samples. To do so, first, we construct an auxiliary task of Attention-weighted Semantic Relation Distillation (ASRD), which adaptively distillates feature relations with category-agnostic semantic information learned by the SAM encoder into a local feature learning network, to improve local feature description using semantic discrimination. Second, we develop a technique called Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning Based on Semantic Grouping (WSC), which utilizes semantic groupings derived from SAM as weakly supervised signals, to optimize the metric space of local descriptors. Third, we design an Edge Attention Guidance (EAG) to further improve the accuracy of local feature detection and description by prompting the network to pay more attention to the edge region guided by SAM. SAMFeat's performance on various tasks, such as image matching on HPatches, and long-term visual localization on Aachen Day-Night showcases its superiority over previous local features.

Finding eligible patients involves comparing the patient's information with the CT eligibility criteria. Automated patient matching offers the promise of improving the process, yet the main difficulties of CT retrieval lie in the semantic complexity of matching unstructured patient descriptions with semi-structured, multi-field CT documents and in capturing the meaning of negation coming from the eligibility criteria.\\nOBJECTIVES: This paper tackles the challenges of CT retrieval by presenting an approach that addresses the patient-to-trials paradigm. Our approach involves two key components in a pipeline-based model: (i) a data enrichment technique for enhancing both queries and documents during the first retrieval stage, and (ii) a novel re-ranking schema that uses a Transformer network in a setup adapted to this task by leveraging the structure of the CT documents.\\nMETHODS: We use named entity recognition and negation detection in both patient description and the eligibility section of CTs. We further classify patient descriptions and CT eligibility criteria into current, past, and family medical conditions. This extracted information is used to boost the importance of disease and drug mentions in both query and index for lexical retrieval. Furthermore, we propose a two-step training schema for the Transformer network used to re-rank the results from the lexical retrieval. The first step focuses on matching patient information with the descriptive sections of trials, while the second step aims to determine eligibility by matching patient information with the criteria section.\\nRESULTS: Our findings indicate that the inclusion criteria section of the CT has a great influence on the relevance score in lexical models, and that the enrichment techniques for queries and documents improve the retrieval of relevant trials. The re-ranking strategy, based on our training schema, consistently enhances CT retrieval and shows improved performance by 15% in terms of precision at retrieving eligible trials.\\nCONCLUSION: The results of our experiments suggest the benefit of making use of extracted entities. Moreover, our proposed re-ranking schema shows promising effectiveness compared to larger neural models, even with limited training data. These findings offer valuable insights for improving methods for retrieval of clinical documents.\"}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Challenging large language models’ “intelligence” with human tools: A neuropsychological investigation in Italian language on prefrontal functioning', 'abstract': 'The Artificial Intelligence (AI) research community has used ad-hoc benchmarks to measure the \"<i>intelligence</i>\" level of Large Language Models (LLMs). In humans, intelligence is closely linked to the functional integrity of the prefrontal lobes, which are essential for higher-order cognitive processes. Previous research has found that LLMs struggle with cognitive tasks that rely on these prefrontal functions, highlighting a significant challenge in replicating human-like intelligence. In December 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT, a new chatbot based on the GPT-3.5 model that quickly gained popularity for its impressive ability to understand and respond to human instructions, suggesting a significant step towards intelligent behaviour in AI. Therefore, to rigorously investigate LLMs\\' level of \"<i>intelligence</i>,\" we evaluated the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 versions through a neuropsychological assessment using tests in the Italian language routinely employed to assess prefrontal functioning in humans. The same tests were also administered to Claude2 and Llama2 to verify whether similar language models perform similarly in prefrontal tests. When using human performance as a reference, GPT-3.5 showed inhomogeneous results on prefrontal tests, with some tests well above average, others in the lower range, and others frankly impaired. Specifically, we have identified poor planning abilities and difficulty in recognising semantic absurdities and understanding others\\' intentions and mental states. Claude2 exhibited a similar pattern to GPT-3.5, while Llama2 performed poorly in almost all tests. These inconsistent profiles highlight how LLMs\\' emergent abilities do not yet mimic human cognitive functioning. The sole exception was GPT-4, which performed within the normative range for all the tasks except planning. Furthermore, we showed how standardised neuropsychological batteries developed to assess human cognitive functions may be suitable for challenging LLMs\\' performance.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'A phenotype-based AI pipeline outperforms human experts in differentially diagnosing rare diseases using EHRs', 'abstract': 'Rare diseases, affecting ~350 million people worldwide, pose significant challenges in clinical diagnosis due to the lack of experienced physicians and the complexity of differentiating between numerous rare diseases. To address these challenges, we introduce PhenoBrain, a fully automated artificial intelligence pipeline. PhenoBrain utilizes a BERT-based natural language processing model to extract phenotypes from clinical texts in EHRs and employs five new diagnostic models for differential diagnoses of rare diseases. The AI system was developed and evaluated on diverse, multi-country rare disease datasets, comprising 2271 cases with 431 rare diseases. In 1936 test cases, PhenoBrain achieved an average predicted top-3 recall of 0.513 and a top-10 recall of 0.654, surpassing 13 leading prediction methods. In a human-computer study with 75 cases, PhenoBrain exhibited exceptional performance with a top-3 recall of 0.613 and a top-10 recall of 0.813, surpassing the performance of 50 specialist physicians and large language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4. Combining PhenoBrain’s predictions with specialists increased the top-3 recall to 0.768, demonstrating its potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy in clinical workflows.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'On the Analyses of Medical Images Using Traditional Machine Learning Techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks', 'abstract': 'Convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown dissuasive accomplishment on different areas especially Object Detection, Segmentation, Reconstruction (2D and 3D), Information Retrieval, Medical Image Registration, Multi-lingual translation, Local language Processing, Anomaly Detection on video and Speech Recognition.

Here, we attempt to combine machine learning methods and neurobiological frameworks to propose a computational model of brain systems potentially responsible for wordform representation. We tested the hypothesis that the functional specialization of word representation in the brain is driven partly by computational optimization. This hypothesis directly addresses the unique problem of mapping sound and articulation vs. mapping sound and meaning.\\nResults: We found that artificial neural networks trained on the mapping between sound and articulation performed poorly in recognizing the mapping between sound and meaning and vice versa. Moreover, a network trained on both tasks simultaneously could not discover the features required for efficient mapping between sound and higher-level cognitive states compared to the other two models. Furthermore, these networks developed internal representations reflecting specialized task-optimized functions without explicit training.\\nDiscussion: Together, these findings demonstrate that different task-directed representations lead to more focused responses and better performance of a machine or algorithm and, hypothetically, the brain. Thus, we imply that the functional specialization of word representation mirrors a computational optimization strategy given the nature of the tasks that the human brain faces.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Evidence synthesis, digital scribes, and translational challenges for artificial intelligence in healthcare', 'abstract': 'Healthcare has well-known challenges with safety, quality, and effectiveness, and many see artificial intelligence (AI) as essential to any solution. Emerging applications include the automated synthesis of best-practice research evidence including systematic reviews, which would ultimately see all clinical trial data published in a computational form for immediate synthesis. Digital scribes embed themselves in the process of care to detect, record, and summarize events and conversations for the electronic record. However, three persistent translational challenges must be addressed before AI is widely deployed. First, little effort is spent replicating AI trials, exposing patients to risks of methodological error and biases. Next, there is little reporting of patient harms from trials. Finally, AI built using machine learning may perform less effectively in different clinical settings.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem this research cluster is addressing is the enhancement and evaluation of local feature learning and detection methods, particularly incorporating semantic information, to improve downstream tasks such as patient information retrieval and entity extraction in complex, multi-modal datasets. Central nodes such as 'local feature learning', 'semantic information', and 'transformer network' underscore the focus on combining semantic understanding with advanced model architectures. Thematically, the landscape bifurcates into (1) learning semantic-rich feature representations and (2) applying these representations in specialized contexts such as clinical patient-trial matching enhanced by re-ranking approaches. Dominant paradigms include the use of attention-based Transformer networks, semantic distillation techniques, and multi-stage training schemas that leverage entity extraction to enrich input features for re-ranking models.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps stem from fragmented integration between semantic feature learning and application-specific re-ranking models. Despite the centrality of transformer architectures as bridges, existing approaches do not fully unify semantic local feature learning with domain-specific re-ranking, resulting in suboptimal replicability and transferability across different datasets and tasks. Moreover, limitations highlighted in the foundational papers—including challenges in handling complex semantic negation, limited training data scenarios, and inconsistent performance across heterogeneous clinical settings—point to methodological robustness issues. External gaps identified via global GPS analysis indicate an underexploited opportunity to merge insights from advanced image-based feature learning and person re-identification—domains rich with innovations in semi-supervised classification, flow embeddings, and Vision Transformer-based models—with clinical re-ranking tasks. For instance, the concept of 'person re-identification' in computer vision as a robust form of feature learning and re-ranking could transfer to clinical patient matching, enabling more robust representation and ranking despite noisy or limited labeled data.",
