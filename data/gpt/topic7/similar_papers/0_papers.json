    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted various aspects of healthcare, particularly in the medical imaging field. This review focuses on recent developments in the application of deep learning (DL) techniques to breast cancer imaging. DL models, a subset of AI algorithms inspired by human brain architecture, have demonstrated remarkable success in analyzing complex medical images, enhancing diagnostic precision, and streamlining workflows. DL models have been applied to breast cancer diagnosis via mammography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, DL-based radiomic approaches may play a role in breast cancer risk assessment, prognosis prediction, and therapeutic response monitoring. Nevertheless, several challenges have limited the widespread adoption of AI techniques in clinical practice, emphasizing the importance of rigorous validation, interpretability, and technical considerations when implementing DL solutions. By examining fundamental concepts in DL techniques applied to medical imaging and synthesizing the latest advancements and trends, this narrative review aims to provide valuable and up-to-date insights for radiologists seeking to harness the power of AI in breast cancer care.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have shown promising accuracy in analysis of medical images. Alzeheimer Disease (AD), a prevalent form of dementia, uses Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, which is then analysed via DL models. To address the model computational constraints, Cloud Computing (CC) is integrated to operate with the DL models. Recent articles on DL-based MRI have not discussed datasets specific to different diseases, which makes it difficult to build the specific DL model. Thus, the article systematically explores a tutorial approach, where we first discuss a classification taxonomy of medical imaging datasets. Next, we present a case-study on AD MRI classification using the DL methods. We analyse three distinct models-Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16), and an ensemble approach-for classification and predictive outcomes. In addition, we designed a novel framework that offers insight into how various layers interact with the dataset. Our architecture comprises an input layer, a cloud-based layer responsible for preprocessing and model execution, and a diagnostic layer that issues alerts after successful classification and prediction. According to our simulations, CNN outperformed other models with a test accuracy of 99.285%, followed by VGG-16 with 85.113%, while the ensemble model lagged with a disappointing test accuracy of 79.192%. Our cloud Computing framework serves as an efficient mechanism for medical image processing while safeguarding patient confidentiality and data privacy.",

    "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders are now responsible for the largest proportion of the global burden of disease, and even more challenges have been seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Artificial intelligence (AI) is commonly used to facilitate the early detection of disease, understand disease progression, and discover new treatments in the fields of both physical and mental health. The present review provides a broad overview of AI methodology and its applications in data acquisition and processing, feature extraction and characterization, psychiatric disorder classification, potential biomarker detection, real-time monitoring, and interventions in psychiatric disorders. We also comprehensively summarize AI applications with regard to the early warning, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of specific psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, addiction, sleep disorders, and Alzheimer's disease. The advantages and disadvantages of AI in psychiatry are clarified. We foresee a new wave of research opportunities to facilitate and improve AI technology and its long-term implications in psychiatry during and after the COVID-19 era.",

    "citationCount": 103,
    "fieldCitationRatio": 37.89,
    "abstract": "Interest in real-world data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE) to expedite and enrich the development of new biopharmaceutical products has proliferated in recent years, spurred by the 21st Century Cures Act in the United States and similar policy efforts in other countries, willingness by regulators to consider RWE in their decisions, demands from third-party payers, and growing concerns about the limitations of traditional clinical trials. Although much of the recent literature on RWE has focused on potential regulatory uses (e.g., product approvals in oncology or rare diseases based on single-arm trials with external control arms), this article reviews how biopharmaceutical companies can leverage RWE to inform internal decisions made throughout the product development process. Specifically, this article will review use of RWD to guide pipeline and portfolio strategy; use of novel sources of RWD to inform product development, use of RWD to inform clinical development, use of advanced analytics to harness \"big\" RWD, and considerations when using RWD to inform internal decisions. Topics discussed will include the use of molecular, clinicogenomic, medical imaging, radiomic, and patient-derived xenograft data to augment traditional sources of RWE, the use of RWD to inform clinical trial eligibility criteria, enrich trial population based on predicted response, select endpoints, estimate sample size, understand disease progression, and enhance diversity of participants, the growing use of data tokenization and advanced analytical techniques based on artificial intelligence in RWE, as well as the importance of data quality and methodological transparency in RWE.",

    "abstract": "There is an evolution and increasing need for the utilization of emerging cellular, molecular and <i>in silico</i> technologies and novel approaches for safety assessment of food, drugs, and personal care products. Convergence of these emerging technologies is also enabling rapid advances and approaches that may impact regulatory decisions and approvals. Although the development of emerging technologies may allow rapid advances in regulatory decision making, there is concern that these new technologies have not been thoroughly evaluated to determine if they are ready for regulatory application, singularly or in combinations. The magnitude of these combined technical advances may outpace the ability to assess fit for purpose and to allow routine application of these new methods for regulatory purposes. There is a need to develop strategies to evaluate the new technologies to determine which ones are ready for regulatory use. The opportunity to apply these potentially faster, more accurate, and cost-effective approaches remains an important goal to facilitate their incorporation into regulatory use. However, without a clear strategy to evaluate emerging technologies rapidly and appropriately, the value of these efforts may go unrecognized or may take longer. It is important for the regulatory science field to keep up with the research in these technically advanced areas and to understand the science behind these new approaches. The regulatory field must understand the critical quality attributes of these novel approaches and learn from each other's experience so that workforces can be trained to prepare for emerging global regulatory challenges. Moreover, it is essential that the regulatory community must work with the technology developers to harness collective capabilities towards developing a strategy for evaluation of these new and novel assessment tools.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian cell is a complex entity, with membrane-bound and membrane-less organelles playing vital roles in regulating cellular homeostasis. Organellar protein niches drive discrete biological processes and cell functions, thus maintaining cell equilibrium. Cellular processes such as signaling, growth, proliferation, motility, and programmed cell death require dynamic protein movements between cell compartments. Aberrant protein localization is associated with a wide range of diseases. Therefore, analyzing the subcellular proteome of the cell can provide a comprehensive overview of cellular biology. With recent advancements in mass spectrometry, imaging technology, computational tools, and deep machine learning algorithms, studies pertaining to subcellular protein localization and their dynamic distributions are gaining momentum. These studies reveal changing interaction networks because of \"moonlighting proteins\" and serve as a discovery tool for disease network mechanisms. Consequently, this review aims to provide a comprehensive repository for recent advancements in subcellular proteomics subcontexting methods, challenges, and future perspectives for method developers. In summary, subcellular proteomics is crucial to the understanding of the fundamental cellular mechanisms and the associated diseases.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in data science in general and machine learning in particular have transformed the way experts envision the future of surgery. Surgical Data Science (SDS) is a new research field that aims to improve the quality of interventional healthcare through the capture, organization, analysis and modeling of data. While an increasing number of data-driven approaches and clinical applications have been studied in the fields of radiological and clinical data science, translational success stories are still lacking in surgery. In this publication, we shed light on the underlying reasons and provide a roadmap for future advances in the field. Based on an international workshop involving leading researchers in the field of SDS, we review current practice, key achievements and initiatives as well as available standards and tools for a number of topics relevant to the field, namely (1) infrastructure for data acquisition, storage and access in the presence of regulatory constraints, (2) data annotation and sharing and (3) data analytics. We further complement this technical perspective with (4) a review of currently available SDS products and the translational progress from academia and (5) a roadmap for faster clinical translation and exploitation of the full potential of SDS, based on an international multi-round Delphi process.",

    "abstract": "This conceptual paper describes the current state of mental health services, identifies critical problems, and suggests how to solve them. I focus on the potential contributions of artificial intelligence and precision mental health to improving mental health services. Toward that end, I draw upon my own research, which has changed over the last half century, to highlight the need to transform the way we conduct mental health services research. I identify exemplars from the emerging literature on artificial intelligence and precision approaches to treatment in which there is an attempt to personalize or fit the treatment to the client in order to produce more effective interventions.",

    "abstract": "Translational research in vision prosthetics, gene therapy, optogenetics, stem cell and other forms of transplantation, and sensory substitution is creating new therapeutic options for patients with neural forms of blindness. The technical challenges faced by each of these disciplines differ considerably, but they all face the same challenge of how to assess vision in patients with ultra-low vision (ULV), who will be the earliest subjects to receive new therapies. Historically, there were few tests to assess vision in ULV patients. In the 1990s, the field of visual prosthetics expanded rapidly, and this activity led to a heightened need to develop better tests to quantify end points for clinical studies. Each group tended to develop novel tests, which made it difficult to compare outcomes across groups. The common lack of validation of the tests and the variable use of controls added to the challenge of interpreting the outcomes of these clinical studies. In 2014, at the bi-annual International \"Eye and the Chip\" meeting of experts in the field of visual prosthetics, a group of interested leaders agreed to work cooperatively to develop the International Harmonization of Outcomes and Vision Endpoints in Vision Restoration Trials (HOVER) Taskforce. Under this banner, more than 80 specialists across seven topic areas joined an effort to formulate guidelines for performing and reporting psychophysical tests in humans who participate in clinical trials for visual restoration. This document provides the complete version of the consensus opinions from the HOVER taskforce, which, together with its rules of governance, will be posted on the website of the Henry Ford Department of Ophthalmology (www.artificialvision.org). Research groups or companies that choose to follow these guidelines are encouraged to include a specific statement to that effect in their communications to the public. The Executive Committee of the HOVER Taskforce will maintain a list of all human psychophysical research in the relevant fields of research on the same website to provide an overview of methods and outcomes of all clinical work being performed in an attempt to restore vision to the blind. This website will also specify which scientific publications contain the statement of certification. The website will be updated every 2 years and continue to exist as a living document of worldwide efforts to restore vision to the blind. The HOVER consensus document has been written by over 80 of the world's experts in vision restoration and low vision and provides recommendations on the measurement and reporting of patient outcomes in vision restoration trials.",
