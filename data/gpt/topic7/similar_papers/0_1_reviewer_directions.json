    "title": "Cloud-Native Privacy-Preserving Multi-Center LLM Benchmarking Platform",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current replication studies in NLP benchmarks fail to scale across decentralized clinical data sources due to privacy concerns and lack of secure, scalable infrastructure accommodating regulatory constraints.",
    "Motivation": "Fills the external gap on combining cloud computing with AI adoption by building a privacy-preserving multi-institutional benchmarking platform. Inspired by Opportunity 2, this addresses model validation scalability with respect to strict privacy and governance constraints.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design and implement a federated learning platform with cloud-native infrastructure supporting secure multiparty computation and differential privacy. The system federates LLM inference and evaluation on institutional clinical datasets without raw data exchange, providing unified replicability assessments across decentralized benchmarks with fully auditable pipelines and compliance enforcement.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collaborate with multiple clinical institutions to access local datasets; 2) Implement privacy-preserving LLM benchmarking modules within federated learning frameworks; 3) Conduct benchmark evaluations on de-identified clinical NLP tasks; 4) Compare replicability metrics versus centralized approaches; 5) Assess scalability, communication overhead, and compliance adherence; 6) Iterate platform based on regulatory feedback and institutional audits.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM evaluation task for named entity recognition on patient pathology reports distributed across three hospitals. Expected Output: Unified benchmark results reflecting combined but privacy-preserved performance metrics, showing consistent replicability without data leakage or regulatory violations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If federated infrastructure constraints arise, pivot to hybrid approaches using synthetic data generation and secured cloud enclaves for evaluation. Alternatively, modularize platform components for adaptation to less restrictive environments."

For instance, steps involving collaboration with multiple clinical institutions should explicitly address data access approvals, heterogeneous data schemas, and potential institutional resistance due to legal or resource constraints. Additionally, communication overhead and system latency should be quantitatively estimated early in the plan to confirm feasibility at scale. Including concrete evaluation metrics for compliance adherence and security auditing will strengthen the experimental design and provide clearer success criteria. Providing contingency plans or risk mitigation strategies within each experimental step will enhance robustness and practical viability of this federated benchmarking approach, especially given the complexity of integrating secure multiparty computation with cloud-native infrastructure in sensitive clinical environments. It is recommended to refine the experiment plan by adding such operational and metric-level specifics to ensure the research can move smoothly from prototype to realistic institutional adoption phases starting from the initial experiments stage, thereby improving practical feasibility and impact confidence in the proposal's outcomes.\",\"target_section\":\"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\"},{"
