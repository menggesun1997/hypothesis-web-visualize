    "abstract": "Intelligent decision-making (IDM) is a cornerstone of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to automate or augment decision processes. Modern IDM paradigms integrate advanced frameworks to enable intelligent agents to make effective and adaptive choices and decompose complex tasks into manageable steps, such as AI agents and high-level reinforcement learning. Recent advances in multimodal foundation-based approaches unify diverse input modalities-such as vision, language, and sensory data-into a cohesive decision-making process. Foundation models (FMs) have become pivotal in science and industry, transforming decision-making and research capabilities. Their large-scale, multimodal data-processing abilities foster adaptability and interdisciplinary breakthroughs across fields such as healthcare, life sciences, and education. This survey examines IDM's evolution, advanced paradigms with FMs and their transformative impact on decision-making across diverse scientific and industrial domains, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in building efficient, adaptive, and ethical decision systems.",

    "year": 2025,
    "citationCount": 13,

    "abstract": "Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies-such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks-to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows-namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity-critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.",

    "title": "Larger models yield better results? Streamlined severity classification of ADHD-related concerns using BERT-based knowledge distillation",
    "year": 2025,
    "citationCount": 1,
    "fieldCitationRatio": 0.0,
    "abstract": "This work focuses on the efficiency of the knowledge distillation approach in generating a lightweight yet powerful BERT-based model for natural language processing (NLP) applications. After the model creation, we applied the resulting model, LastBERT, to a real-world task-classifying severity levels of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)-related concerns from social media text data. Referring to LastBERT, a customized student BERT model, we significantly lowered model parameters from 110 million BERT base to 29 million-resulting in a model approximately 73.64% smaller. On the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark, comprising paraphrase identification, sentiment analysis, and text classification, the student model maintained strong performance across many tasks despite this reduction. The model was also used on a real-world ADHD dataset with an accuracy of 85%, F1 score of 85%, precision of 85%, and recall of 85%. When compared to DistilBERT (66 million parameters) and ClinicalBERT (110 million parameters), LastBERT demonstrated comparable performance, with DistilBERT slightly outperforming it at 87%, and ClinicalBERT achieving 86% across the same metrics. These findings highlight the LastBERT model's capacity to classify degrees of ADHD severity properly, so it offers a useful tool for mental health professionals to assess and comprehend material produced by users on social networking platforms. The study emphasizes the possibilities of knowledge distillation to produce effective models fit for use in resource-limited conditions, hence advancing NLP and mental health diagnosis. Furthermore underlined by the considerable decrease in model size without appreciable performance loss is the lower computational resources needed for training and deployment, hence facilitating greater applicability. Especially using readily available computational tools like Google Colab and Kaggle Notebooks. This study shows the accessibility and usefulness of advanced NLP methods in pragmatic world applications.",

    "abstract": "As financial institutions want openness and accountability in their automated systems, the task of understanding model choices has become more crucial in the field of financial text analysis. In this study, we propose xFiTRNN, a hybrid model that integrates self-attention mechanisms, linearized phrase structure, and a contextualized transformer-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to enhance both model performance and explainability in financial sentence prediction. The model captures subtle contextual information from financial texts while maintaining explainability. xFiTRNN provides transparent, sentence-level insights into predictions by incorporating advanced explainability techniques such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and Anchors. Extensive evaluations on benchmark financial datasets demonstrate that xFiTRNN not only achieves a remarkable prediction performance but also enhances explainability in the financial sector. This work highlights the potential of hybrid transformer-based RNN architectures for fostering more accountable and understandable Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in finance.",

    "abstract": "This review explores the role of prompt engineering in unleashing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Prompt engineering is the process of structuring inputs, and it has emerged as a crucial technique for maximizing the utility and accuracy of these models. Both foundational and advanced prompt engineering methodologies-including techniques such as self-consistency, chain of thought, and generated knowledge, which can significantly enhance the performance of models-are explored in this paper. Additionally, the prompt methods for vision language models (VLMs) are examined in detail. Prompt methods are evaluated with subjective and objective metrics, ensuring a robust analysis of their efficacy. Critical to this discussion is the role of prompt engineering in artificial intelligence (AI) security, particularly in terms of defending against adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs. Strategies for minimizing these risks and improving the robustness of models are thoroughly reviewed. Finally, we provide a perspective for future research and applications.",
