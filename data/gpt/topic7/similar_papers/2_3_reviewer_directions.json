    "title": "Self-paced Contrastive Learning for Robust Clinical Re-ranking under Data Scarcity",
    "Problem_Statement": "Re-ranking models for clinical patient-trial matching degrade when labeled data is scarce and clinical descriptions vary widely, limiting replicability and practical deployment.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing methodological robustness under limited data scenarios highlighted in the critical gaps by adopting self-paced learning principles combined with contrastive learning adapted from person re-identification research.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a self-paced curriculum learning framework that gradually incorporates harder-to-classify unlabeled clinical samples into contrastive training for re-ranking models. Use semantic similarity metrics derived from entity extraction to guide pseudo-label confidence and sample weighting, thereby enhancing feature representation without excessive labeled data.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Use public clinical datasets with annotated and unlabeled patient-trial matching data. 2) Train baseline fully-supervised re-ranking models. 3) Implement contrastive learning with self-paced sample selection and semantic similarity weighting. 4) Evaluate ranking improvements, sample efficiency, and generalization across heterogeneous clinical sites.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Partial patient clinical summaries with no trial labels; Output: Improved ranking of potentially eligible trials with confidence scores derived from self-paced contrastive embeddings reflecting semantic matches.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If self-paced scheduling harms convergence, revert to fixed curriculum schedules or employ data augmentation. Alternatively, incorporate domain adaptation techniques to leverage external related datasets."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method proposes a self-paced curriculum learning framework combined with contrastive learning guided by semantic similarity from entity extraction. However, the mechanism for how harder samples are identified, weighted, and integrated convincingly into contrastive loss remains underspecified. It would be beneficial to clarify the specific metrics, thresholds, and scheduling strategies that govern sample difficulty and pseudo-label confidence, as well as how semantic similarity scores quantitatively influence sample weighting. Providing a formalized description or pseudocode of this self-paced contrastive learning pipeline will strengthen the method's conceptual rigor and reproducibility potential. Additionally, consider discussing potential failure modes where inaccurate semantic extraction could propagate noise in pseudo-labels and how this is mitigated, enhancing the justification of the mechanism's soundness and robustness under clinical data variability and scarcity conditions. This refinement is critical before proceeding to experiments, to avoid ambiguous method implementation and incomplete evaluation interpretation in a complex clinical setting. It addresses a core aspect of soundness: clarity and reasoning of the proposed learning mechanism is pivotal for reviewers and implementers alike to trust and reproduce the findings effectively and for the research impact to materialize convincingly in this challenging domain context (clinical trial re-ranking)."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is appropriately structured across baseline establishment, method implementation, and evaluation stages. However, feasibility concerns exist regarding the broadness and complexity of evaluation criteria: ranking improvements, sample efficiency, and cross-site generalization on heterogeneous clinical datasets. Given data scarcity and variability, the proposed plan should explicitly specify: (i) concrete dataset selections with size, label distributions, and known clinical heterogeneity; (ii) quantitative metrics for ranking (e.g., NDCG, MAP), sample efficiency curves, and generalization (statistical tests across sites); (iii) the process for integrating unlabeled clinical samples, including data preprocessing and semantic entity extraction tools to be used; and (iv) computational resources and runtime considerations given iterative self-paced training. Furthermore, an ablation study isolating effects of curriculum scheduling versus semantic similarity weighting would be crucial for interpretability. Outline contingency measures within experiments beyond fallback plans, such as micro-experiments validating pseudo-label confidence calibration. These clarifications will enhance scientific rigor and practical reproducibility, ensuring the experiments can convincingly validate both soundness and method efficacy under realistic resource constraints and clinical variability scenarios."
