    "Problem_Statement": "Scaling federated training of large transformer models on heterogeneous multimodal medical data suffers from high communication costs and unstable performance across domains due to inefficient parameter updates and metadata representation mismatch.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the critical internal and external gaps, this research proposes a novel approach combining transformer pruning with dynamic, metadata-driven encoding in federated learning to optimize communication and maintain replicability in LLM performance across domains.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement a federated learning system where each client applies dynamic transformer head and feed-forward layer pruning guided by locally encoded, compressed multimodal metadata representing domain characteristics. Develop a metadata embedding network that evolves during training to effectively summarize domain shifts and sparsity needs.

        "title": "Communication-Efficient Federated Transformer Pruning with Adaptive Multimodal Metadata Embedding and Weighted Aggregation for Clinical AI",
        "Problem_Statement": "Scaling federated training of large transformer models on heterogeneous multimodal medical data remains challenged by excessive communication overhead and unstable cross-domain performance caused by naïve parameter updates and insufficient modeling of domain-specific distributional shifts through metadata. Existing federated pruning and metadata encoding approaches lack precise mechanisms connecting metadata to pruning decisions and reliable aggregation schemes that preserve performance under domain heterogeneity and privacy constraints.",
        "Motivation": "While prior works explore federated learning with pruning or static metadata embeddings, this proposal pioneers an integrated, adaptive framework where dynamic multimodal metadata embeddings directly inform localized transformer pruning strategies, combined with metadata similarity-weighted aggregation to improve communication efficiency and domain generalization. This framework leverages insights from model-agnostic meta-learning and vision-language models to establish a robust, privacy-conscious clinical AI pipeline adaptable to evolving, diverse medical environments — addressing competitive gaps in internal pruning dynamics and cross-site generalizability with clear operational rigor and theoretical grounding.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We design a federated learning system operating on multimodal medical datasets (e.g., MRI images and corresponding diagnostic notes) across multiple clients (hospitals). Each client maintains a metadata embedding network architected as a lightweight multimodal transformer encoder combining convolutional and self-attention layers, producing a compact domain state vector (embedding dimension ~128). These embeddings evolve every federated round capturing domain shifts. Dynamic pruning is performed locally using a heuristic metric: transformer heads and feed-forward network (FFN) neurons with low saliency scores weighted by the similarity between the current metadata embedding and a learned sparsity profile vector are pruned. Saliency is computed via magnitude-based scores combined with second-order gradient approximations reflecting neuron importance in the local domain. To ensure pruning mask consistency, pruning schedules apply gradual, layer-wise sparsity increments synchronized every fixed number of rounds, blending local adaptations with global pruning masks aggregated on the server. Server-side aggregation employs a novel metadata similarity-weighted averaging algorithm where client updates are weighted proportionally to the cosine similarity between their metadata embeddings. This biases aggregation toward clients with similar domain states, mitigating negative transfer and enhancing domain-specific performance. The overall protocol integrates privacy-preserving secure aggregation protocols to maintain client confidentiality. Theoretically, we outline convergence properties showing that weighted aggregation under bounded metadata embedding deviations from a true domain manifold yields stable federated updates with provable communication savings. The fallback strategy involves switching to cluster-based domain grouping and static pruning masks if metadata embedding drift exceeds a threshold or pruning induces unstable convergence, with fallback triggers integrated into the aggregation protocol to allow seamless transitions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset Selection: Choose publicly available federated multimodal clinical datasets such as the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) and integrating EHR notes to reflect realistic domain heterogeneity — including variation in data modalities (MRI-T1, T2, FLAIR, diagnostic texts), dataset sizes (ranging 100-1000 patients per client), and demographic variability. Apply privacy constraints by simulating local-only data access.\n2. Baseline Modeling: Train a federated vanilla transformer model across clients without pruning to establish performance and communication cost baselines; model architecture details include multimodal transformer with 12 layers, hidden size 768.\n3. Metadata Encoder Design: Implement and pretrain the metadata embedding networks per client using modality-specific encoders fused by transformer layers; embedding dimension fixed at 128. Update embeddings every federated round using local batch normalization statistics and domain-specific auxiliary loss to capture distribution drift.\n4. Dynamic Pruning Deployment: Define pruning schedules with gradual sparsity increase of 5% every 3 federated rounds up to 50% sparsity. Compute saliency scores incorporating magnitude pruning with Hessian-based sensitivity metrics to determine pruning masks dynamically per client influenced by metadata embeddings.\n5. Weighted Aggregation Procedure: Compute cosine similarity between client metadata embeddings at each aggregation round to weight parameter updates. Validate similarity metrics through ablation comparing to uniform averaging.\n6. Evaluation Metrics: Assess communication cost in bits communicated, accuracy and F1 score per client, variance of accuracy across clients over training rounds, convergence speed measured by rounds to reach 90% baseline accuracy, and computational resource usage (CPU/GPU cycles, memory).\n7. Simulation Environment: Setup federated simulation with 10 clients mimicking hospital networks with variable network latency between 50-200 ms, randomly dropping 5% of clients per round to simulate failure, and implement differential privacy noise to client updates to assess compliance.\n8. Fallback Integration: Monitor embedding drift and pruning convergence metrics; trigger fallback to static cluster-based pruning masks whenever a client’s embedding cosine similarity to cluster centroid falls below 0.7 or pruning-induced accuracy drops >10% within 5 rounds.\n9. Pilot Experiments & Robustness Checks: Run preliminary rounds to calibrate pruning thresholds and validate embedding stability; iterate to optimize pruning heuristics and aggregation weights.\n10. Comparative Analysis: Benchmark against state-of-the-art federated pruning and metadata encoding baselines.\n11. Report detailed reproducibility documentation and open-source code for community validation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multiparametric MRI sequences and associated clinical diagnostic notes from 10 simulated hospital sites with heterogeneous data distributions.\nExpected Outputs:\n- Per-client pruning masks adapting dynamically each round, pruning ~50% of heads and neurons without degrading accuracy.\n- Metadata embeddings reflecting client domain variations, used to weight updates in aggregation.\n- Final aggregated model achieving stable and improved accuracy (e.g., 3-5% improvement in F1 score over baseline) with >50% reduction in communication bandwidth.\n- Consistent accuracy variance below 2% across clients demonstrating enhanced domain generalization.\n- Robustness in presence of client dropouts and slight domain drifts.\nAll pruning and aggregation mechanisms fully reproducible and traceable through detailed logs.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the dynamic multimodal metadata embedding fails to reliably capture domain shifts or introduces instability, switch to a clustering approach grouping clients by static domain characteristics (derived from pretraining metadata embeddings) and assign fixed pruning masks per cluster. If localized pruning leads to convergence issues causing accuracy degradation, implement a gradual pruning schedule with enforced global synchronization of pruning masks every certain number of rounds to stabilize model sparsity. These fallback mechanisms are monitored through embedding drift measurements and validation accuracy trends, integrated seamlessly within the federated protocol to ensure robustness without manual intervention. Their triggers and execution paths are explicitly coded in the system for transparency and repeatability."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method's mechanism for dynamic pruning guided by metadata encoding is conceptually strong, yet lacks detailed clarification on how metadata embeddings directly influence pruning decisions and how pruning at local clients interfaces with server aggregation reliably. Clarify the specific architecture of the metadata embedding network, the metrics or heuristics used to determine pruning masks dynamically, and the exact algorithm for weighted aggregation by metadata similarity. Without these, the method's operational flow and rationale remain abstract, reducing confidence in its soundness and reproducibility for peer validation and application in complex multimodal federated settings like medical data scenarios. Provide a more detailed algorithmic or architectural specification and theoretical justification of how these components interplay to achieve stable communication-efficient federated training across heterogeneous domains. This will strengthen the core technical narrative and ensure reviewers understand why the approach should work as intended beyond conceptual novelty and initial intuitions, addressing potential skepticism about practical implementability and domain generalization claims in the federated multimodal transformer context. This is crucial since federated pruning and dynamic metadata encoding are each complex and their interaction is non-trivial, especially when targeting clinical AI pipelines with heterogeneity and privacy constraints. It is recommended to explicitly outline how metadata similarity metrics are computed and used to weight parameter aggregation, how pruning masks are kept consistent or synchronized, and how local domain shifts are captured by evolving embeddings to inform pruning in a seamless federated protocol, possibly integrating some theoretical convergence or error bound insights if available or planned for later work stages. This will solidify the framework's soundness and transparency, key to impactful contributions in strong competition settings. See also clarifying fallback plans' integration to the main pruning dynamics for robustness assurances, reinforcing the core mechanism's practicality and fallback adoption criteria in the manuscript or final design proposal for reviewer thoroughness and trustworthiness assessment clarity in an ACL/NeurIPS review context.

          "feedback_content": "While the Experiment_Plan outlines a sensible sequence from baseline training through design, pruning application, and evaluation, it omits critical details that could risk feasibility, reproducibility, and result interpretability. Specifically, the plan should elaborate on the choice criteria and characteristics of federated multimodal medical datasets, including domain heterogeneity degree, data modalities and sizes, privacy constraints, and baseline model architecture specifics. It should more concretely specify how metadata encoders will be trained, validated, and adapted across clients, including embedding dimension, update frequency, and integration with federated aggregation rounds. The pruning approach requires operational details on pruning schedules, thresholds, and how dynamic pruning metrics adapt per domain state during federated rounds. Evaluation metrics must extend to measures of convergence speed, model utility degradation post-pruning, consistency across clients over time, and system resource usage beyond communication bandwidth to paint a convincing picture of comprehensive feasibility and efficiency trade-offs. The hospital network simulation environment needs explicit design parameters: number of simulated clients, network latency, client failure scenarios, and privacy compliance testing frameworks if possible. This level of experiment clarity and operational detail is essential to secure confidence that the proposed methodological contributions are practically testable and replicably demonstrable. Including piloting phases or fallback plan triggers during experimentation would also enhance robustness and contingency preparations. Without these, there is a risk reviewers or practitioners will perceive the feasibility claim as underdeveloped, weakening the paper’s practical contribution, especially as federated multimodal pruning is ambitious and technically complex.
