        "title": "Adaptive Patient-Centric Attribute-Based Access Control via Co-Design",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current attribute-based access control models in healthcare are static and often fail to dynamically reflect individual patient privacy preferences, leading to trust deficits and potential data misuse especially when integrated with LLM systems.",
        "Motivation": "This research addresses the External/Novel Gap of integrating co-design with attribute-based access control (Opportunity 1) to create adaptive models that personalize access control in real-time, enhancing patient trust and data security beyond existing static frameworks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a co-design driven adaptive attribute-based access control (CA-ABAC) framework that incorporates patient and clinician feedback through interactive interfaces to dynamically adjust access policies. The framework utilizes a reinforcement learning agent that personalizes access rules by learning from ongoing preference signals and clinician-patient interaction patterns, integrated directly with LLM-powered EHR query and generation modules.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate a dataset combining EHR access logs, simulated patient privacy preferences, and clinician-patient interaction transcripts; 2. Implement baseline static ABAC systems for comparison; 3. Develop the CA-ABAC prototype with RL-driven policy adaptation informed by co-design session data; 4. Evaluate privacy preservation, patient satisfaction (via surveys), access granularity, and trust metrics across simulated clinical scenarios; 5. Perform ablations to isolate co-design feedback impact.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient A prefers family members to access only summary health info but allows full data to designated clinicians; Clinician B requests access for treatment. The system dynamically updates access rights so Clinician B accesses full data while family gets summaries, reflecting patient preferences in real-time. Expected Output: Access logs show selective data exposure per updated policies; Patient surveys indicate increased trust.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If RL adaptation proves unstable, fallback to a rule-based system incorporating preference clusters derived from co-design workshops; if user feedback integration lags, simulate preference updates via synthetic user modeling and iterate from there."

        "title": "Collaborative Bias Auditing and Transparency Toolkits for Clinician-Patient Co-Designed LLM Interfaces",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM clinical support systems lack transparency mechanisms co-designed with both clinicians and patients to effectively mitigate bias and foster equitable healthcare AI usage.",
        "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical siloing identified between co-design and clinician-patient interactions (Internal Gaps) and targets Opportunity 2 to collaboratively develop bias mitigation and transparency tools that are context-aware and aligned with stakeholder needs.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an interactive bias auditing toolkit within clinical LLM interfaces co-designed via multi-stakeholder workshops. The toolkit visualizes AI decision rationales, surfaces provenance of outputs, and highlights potential bias flags contextualized to patient demographics. This interface is augmented by explainable AI modules customized to clinician and patient literacy levels, enabling co-learning and bias reduction in real-time support scenarios.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multi-modal datasets including clinician notes, patient demographics, and AI output rationales; 2. Develop baseline LLM clinical support without transparency aids; 3. Conduct co-design workshops to shape toolkit functionalities and UI/UX; 4. Integrate explainability and bias detection modules into LLM APIs; 5. Evaluate impact through controlled user studies measuring bias perception, trust, and decision accuracy.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM suggests medication alternative for Patient C who belongs to an underserved minority group. Toolkit highlights bias flags indicating underrepresentation in training data and shows explanation for suggestion. Expected Output: Clinician identifies potential bias, adjusts recommendation accordingly, and patient is more informed and trusts the AI support.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time bias detection is challenging, implement post-hoc transparency reports; if user studies indicate UI complexity is a barrier, apply iterative simplifications focusing on core bias insights."

        "title": "Co-Evolutionary Training Pipelines Incorporating Dynamic Stakeholder Feedback to Mitigate LLM Bias",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLM training pipelines on large healthcare corpora seldom incorporate continuous feedback from stakeholders, limiting fairness, replicability, and relevance of deployed models.",
        "Motivation": "This project answers the External Gap related to co-evolving health data and LLM training through co-design frameworks (Opportunity 3), introducing a paradigm where model training and stakeholder insights evolve in tandem.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a co-evolutionary training pipeline that integrates iterative feedback loops from clinicians and patients into data curation, model fine-tuning, and evaluation stages. Using active learning and dynamic data augmentation powered by co-design insights, the pipeline adjusts both training corpora and model parameters continuously. Cloud infrastructure facilitates scalable, transparent retraining cycles to maintain bias-aware and clinically valid LLM deployment.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Deploy baseline LLM trained on standard biomedical corpora; 2. Establish interfaces for clinicians/patients to provide qualitative and quantitative feedback; 3. Implement active learning modules to reweight or augment training data; 4. Periodically retrain/fine-tune LLM and evaluate via fairness metrics, clinical validity, and replicability benchmarks; 5. Compare iterative pipeline with static training approach.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient group feedback indicates LLM underperforms in representing symptoms common in their demographics; pipeline augments corpus with targeted documents and re-trains to reduce bias. Expected Output: Post-retraining evaluation shows improved fairness scores and symptom representation accuracy.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If continuous retraining is computationally infeasible, employ proxy update cycles or distillation methods; if stakeholder feedback lacks consistency, supplement with synthetic bias correction techniques."

        "title": "Hybrid Multi-Agent Framework Linking Co-Design, Access Control, and Clinician-Patient Interaction for Personalized AI Governance",
        "Problem_Statement": "There is a critical absence of integrated frameworks connecting co-design methodologies with access control systems and clinician-patient interaction modalities for holistic AI governance in healthcare.",
        "Motivation": "This idea synthesizes the hidden bridge gap that reveals siloed research clusters, devising a multi-agent system that harmonizes these domains to ensure bias stability and fairness in LLM deployments, moving beyond linear pipelines.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a distributed multi-agent framework where separate agents manage co-design facilitation, attribute-based access control enforcement, and clinician-patient interaction enhancement. These agents communicate in real-time to co-adapt privacy policies, transparency settings, and AI responses individualized per user context. The framework employs decentralized learning with consensus protocols to maintain alignment and fairness across all modules.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Simulate healthcare ecosystem scenarios involving multiple stakeholders; 2. Develop modular agents with clear APIs for co-design inputs, access decisions, and interaction management; 3. Benchmark integrated system against isolated modules on fairness, security, and user satisfaction; 4. Explore scalability on cloud infrastructure; 5. Analyze bias propagation and mitigation effectiveness via synthetic adversarial tests.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient requests restricted data sharing; co-design agent updates preferences; access control agent modifies policies; interaction agent adjusts AI explanations accordingly. Expected Output: Consistent updated policy enforcement, user-aware AI interaction preserving trust and fairness.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If agent coordination is unstable, introduce a central governance controller; if decentralized learning is too slow, opt for periodic synchronization checkpoints."

        "title": "Explainable AI Co-Design Framework for Context-Aware, Patient-Preference Aligned LLM Outputs",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLM outputs in healthcare often lack context-awareness and alignment with nuanced patient preferences, impairing trust and introducing bias.",
        "Motivation": "This approach targets the Novel Gap of linking co-design with clinician-patient interactions to produce transparency and alignment tools (Opportunity 2) by creating a co-designed explainability framework that ensures LLM outputs reflect individual patient contexts and values.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a context embedding layer that incorporates co-design elicited patient preference vectors and clinician contextual signals into the LLM decoding process. An explainability module generates natural language rationales aligned with these preferences, providing interpretable and trustworthy AI-assisted dialogues. The framework supports adaptive transparency levels controlled during interactions by stakeholders.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets pairing clinical dialogues with patient preference profiles; 2. Train LLMs augmented with context embedding modules; 3. Implement explainability modules producing preference-aligned rationales; 4. Run user studies with clinicians and patients evaluating trust and clarity; 5. Benchmark against LLMs without co-designed alignment.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient prefers minimal pharmacological intervention; LLM suggests lifestyle changes with rationale linked to preferences. Expected Output: AI responses include transparent reasoning tailored to the patient’s expressed values, improving satisfaction.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If preference embeddings degrade language quality, explore attention-based integration or multi-task learning; if explainability is weak, incorporate post-hoc interpretability techniques."
