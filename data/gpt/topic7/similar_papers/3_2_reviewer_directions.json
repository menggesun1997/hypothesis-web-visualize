    "title": "Co-Evolutionary Training Pipelines Incorporating Dynamic Stakeholder Feedback to Mitigate LLM Bias",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM training pipelines on large healthcare corpora seldom incorporate continuous feedback from stakeholders, limiting fairness, replicability, and relevance of deployed models.",
    "Motivation": "This project answers the External Gap related to co-evolving health data and LLM training through co-design frameworks (Opportunity 3), introducing a paradigm where model training and stakeholder insights evolve in tandem.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a co-evolutionary training pipeline that integrates iterative feedback loops from clinicians and patients into data curation, model fine-tuning, and evaluation stages. Using active learning and dynamic data augmentation powered by co-design insights, the pipeline adjusts both training corpora and model parameters continuously. Cloud infrastructure facilitates scalable, transparent retraining cycles to maintain bias-aware and clinically valid LLM deployment.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Deploy baseline LLM trained on standard biomedical corpora; 2. Establish interfaces for clinicians/patients to provide qualitative and quantitative feedback; 3. Implement active learning modules to reweight or augment training data; 4. Periodically retrain/fine-tune LLM and evaluate via fairness metrics, clinical validity, and replicability benchmarks; 5. Compare iterative pipeline with static training approach.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient group feedback indicates LLM underperforms in representing symptoms common in their demographics; pipeline augments corpus with targeted documents and re-trains to reduce bias. Expected Output: Post-retraining evaluation shows improved fairness scores and symptom representation accuracy.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If continuous retraining is computationally infeasible, employ proxy update cycles or distillation methods; if stakeholder feedback lacks consistency, supplement with synthetic bias correction techniques."

          "feedback_content": "While the experiment plan outlines reasonable steps, it lacks specifics regarding the scalability and resource demands of continuous retraining with real stakeholder feedback, which could present practical challenges. The plan should elaborate on how often retraining cycles will occur, how feedback quality and variability will be managed, and provide more detailed metrics or validation strategies to ensure consistent improvements. Clarifying these points will strengthen the feasibility assessment and increase confidence in practical deployment in clinical environments where computational resources and time are constrained, and stakeholder input can be noisy or sparse.\n\nSuggested improvements include defining clear retraining frequency policies, robust noise-handling methods for feedback, and fallback thresholds for pipeline intervention to maintain feasibility without compromising clinical relevance or bias mitigation goals.\n\nThis enhancement targets improving the scientific soundness and operational practicality of the experiment plan, a critical foundation for the success of the entire pipeline approach (Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the health domain focus, the proposal would significantly benefit from integrating federated learning techniques. Federated learning can enable secure and privacy-preserving aggregation of distributed clinician and patient feedback across multiple institutions without centralizing sensitive data. This would enhance the impact and novelty by addressing realistic constraints in healthcare data sharing and expanding the pipeline's applicability across diverse clinical sites.\n\nIncorporating federated learning into the co-evolutionary pipeline could advance bias mitigation by capturing heterogeneous feedback patterns and training adaptations across decentralized data silos. This integration also aligns with evolving regulations like the AI Act that emphasize data privacy and ethical AI deployment.\n\nConcretely, the proposal could extend the architecture to include federated active learning modules, federated evaluation metrics, and develop protocols for iterative stakeholder feedback under federated constraints, thereby broadening its relevance and leading edge in the competitive LLM fairness research landscape (Suggested enhancement to Proposed_Method and Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)."
