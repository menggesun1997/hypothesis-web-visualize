    "title": "Explainability-Driven Prompt Optimization for Replicable LLM Outputs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current prompt engineering focuses on performance but often neglects explainability and replicability, weakening trust in production model outputs.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses internal gap concerning model complexity and explainability trade-offs by proposing explainability-informed prompt design to enhance replicability, aligning with Opportunity 1.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an iterative prompt optimization algorithm guided by explainability feedback metrics, such as attention alignment and semantic provenance. The system generates prompts that maximize output interpretability and stabilize response variability under input perturbations, advancing replicable real-world use.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement explainability metrics integrated into prompt scoring. 2) Use evolutionary or reinforcement learning approaches to optimize prompts on standard benchmarks. 3) Evaluate replicability on perturbed inputs compared to baseline prompts. 4) Conduct human evaluation for explanation quality. 5) Deploy optimized prompts in limited production simulations for real-world validation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: FAQ answer generation with optimized explainability-aware prompt. Expected output: Consistent, interpretable answers robust to minor input changes, with clear highlighted rationale.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If explainability metrics poorly correlate with replicability gains, fallback includes multi-objective prompt optimization combining replicability and task accuracy directly, excluding explainability constraints."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks sufficient detail on how exactly explainability feedback metrics (e.g., attention alignment and semantic provenance) will quantitatively guide the prompt optimization algorithm. Clarify the mechanism of integrating these metrics within the optimization loop, including how feedback signals are computed, weighted, and how they influence prompt modifications. Providing a clear mathematical or algorithmic formulation will strengthen the soundness of the approach and help ensure reproducibility and scientific rigor in this relatively novel integration of explainability into prompt engineering methods. Current description risks being perceived as high-level and conceptual without concrete operationalization, potentially weakening confidence in feasibility and replicability claims relevant to the problem statement and motivation sections. Consider providing a formal or pseudocode description in a full paper or supplementary material to add clarity and precision to the method's mechanism."

Specifically, clarify how explainability metrics will be validated as meaningful proxies for replicability before using them to guide optimization (e.g., correlation analysis between metrics and replicability outcomes). Consider more detailed experimental design elements such as sample sizes, benchmark datasets, types of perturbations, and criteria for success in human evaluation. Also, integration of ablation studies to isolate contributions of each component (attention alignment, semantic provenance) and robustness checks against alternative explainability metrics would enhance robustness and scientific soundness of validation. These clear, systematic experimental protocols are crucial for demonstrating feasibility and directly address risks mentioned in the fallback plan."
