          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method section outlines leveraging hardware-based secure enclaves combined with federated multi-modal model training and evaluation, but it lacks sufficient technical detail on how secure enclaves will interact across decentralized datasets, particularly with diverse modalities like images and biosignals. The mechanism for encrypted data flow integration across modalities, and how privacy, scalability, and replicability guarantees are concretely ensured, requires clearer elaboration. Strengthening this aspect with explicit protocol designs, threat models, and interoperability considerations will enhance foundational soundness and trust in the proposed solution's practicality and security properties. Consider providing algorithmic overview or pseudo-code to clarify operations inside enclaves and cross-site coordination steps to better justify the soundness of this federated multi-modal approach under strict privacy constraints, especially given the complexity of combining multi-modal clinical data securely at scale and across institutions with heterogeneous environments and policies, which is non-trivial and a common pitfall in similar prior works. Without these details, the feasibility and security assumptions remain under-specified and vulnerable to critical questions during peer review or real-world deployment evaluation stages, hindering confidence in the methodology's robustness and safety guarantees for sensitive clinical data handling environments, thereby limiting the idea's readiness for adoption and impact realization in clinical AI research and practice contexts as framed by the proposal's motivation and objectives. This foundational clarity is essential to advance beyond conceptual novelty to convincing implementation and replicable benchmarking outcomes under strong privacy assurances as emphasized in the motivation and experiment plan sections, which currently may appear aspirational rather than fully grounded in executable designs and security validations intrinsically tied to enclave capabilities integrated with federated learning platforms handling multi-modal clinical information streams across institutions. Enhancing this aspect directly addresses the core scientific innovation gap exposed by the novelty screening (NOV-COMPETITIVE) since detailed trust assumptions and data flow mechanisms govern the claimed federated benchmarking advancements in academic clinical NLP and imaging applications, effectively bridging the innovation navigation challenge toward impactful contributions on replicability and privacy compliant generalizability in clinical large language model evaluation settings suggested by the proposal's context and goals. A clearer and more concrete methodological outline with precise enclave usage, encrypted data protocols, and federated workflow details will markedly strengthen the proposal's credibility and soundness during expert assessment and increase its potential for broader acceptance and real-world influence in multidisciplinary clinical AI benchmarking research infrastructures involving highly sensitive and heterogeneous clinical data modalities as targeted by this promising preliminary research idea fit for premier AI and NLP conferences' stringent evaluation and impact expectations currently signaled by the NOV-COMPETITIVE rating and highlighted global community priorities for trustworthy and privacy-preserving federated learning solutions in complex clinical domains involving text and imaging data integration tasks and beyond as reflected in the linked concepts list and domain trends. I strongly recommend elaborating this mechanism with specific technical components, threat model assumptions, stepwise enclave federated interaction flows, and data encryption/decryption integration logistics to solidify the proposal's foundation and increase reviewer confidence in its conceptual and operational soundness for intended novel federated clinical LLM benchmarking advances using secure enclaves focused on critical privacy and replicability challenges across multimodal decentralized clinical data environments, which is the core promise underlying the title, problem statement and experiment plan sections while connecting tightly to the feasibility dimensions tagged as next priority after mechanism clarity is improved for proportional impact realization and reviewer score uplift potential at prestigious venues like ACL or NeurIPS where mechanism transparency and technical depth are decisive factors during review phases, particularly in a highly competitive area where marginal innovation gains hinge on precise novel system designs and security guarantees described in methodological components at submission time to optimize acceptance likelihood and scholarly impact trajectory effective immediately and downstream in community reproducibility and adoption efforts. Please address this critical mechanism detail gap before proceeding to large-scale experimentation or broader impact claims to solidify your contribution confidence and research community trust, and hence maximize the proposal's scientific rigor and practical relevance to the federated clinical AI benchmarking field and beyond as intended and highlighted across multiple sections of your research idea description currently presented in an abridged conceptual form requiring augmentation to meet the high standards and expectation scope demanded at top conferences and in real-world clinical AI privacy-sensitive collaborative environments where this work is positioned to make a difference with the right additional technical substance and clarity around mechanism-level innovation and operationalization of secure enclave-based federated multi-modal clinical benchmark evaluation frameworks integrating textual and imaging data securely and scalably across institution boundaries under strict privacy constraints necessary for responsible and trustworthy clinical AI ecosystem maturation in research and practice alike, which remains a key requirement and concern from the broader federated learning and trustworthy AI communities as well captured in the globally linked concepts list provided alongside your idea for enhanced contextual integration baseline as suggested in the review protocol for further refinement and novelty strengthening strategies post clearing foundational soundness issues identified here first for maximal downstream success and impact potential aligned with the venue's rigor and innovation standards expectations indicated by your pre-screening results and topical competition scenario.

          "feedback_content": "To increase the novelty and impact of the proposed federated multi-modal clinical LLM benchmarking framework with secure enclaves, I suggest incorporating concepts from 'edge AI systems' and 'trustworthy AI' listed in the provided globally-linked concepts. Specifically, your approach could be enhanced by integrating lightweight, resource-efficient edge intelligence techniques at partner sites (e.g., hospitals) to preprocess or locally compress multi-modal data securely before encrypted data transmission into enclaves, thereby alleviating communication bottlenecks and improving scalability in resource-constrained environments common in clinical settings. Additionally, embedding formal trustworthy AI principles such as explainability and auditability into your benchmarking protocols can increase transparency and acceptance by clinical domain experts. Combining these edge AI methods and trustworthy AI frameworks could elevate your solution beyond standard enclave-based federated learning by addressing practical deployment challenges and stakeholder trust issues more comprehensively. This integration can help delineate your approach in the highly competitive space, enhance feasibility, and broaden impact by facilitating real-world deployment in complex, resource-constrained clinical ecosystems, thereby increasing both the novelty and practical value of your research idea as aligned to relevant current trends in the field and the linked concepts suggested for inspiration. Explicitly mentioning this expansion and possibly planning experimental evaluations of such edge-trusted federated frameworks in your Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan could also improve reviewer perception of feasibility and impact, helping your work stand out and achieve higher acceptance prospects at top-tier conferences and real-world applicability in sensitive clinical trial contexts your idea targets, ultimately contributing to trustworthy, scalable multi-modal clinical AI systems that comply with stringent privacy requirements while maintaining replicability and performance robustness across institutions and modalities."
