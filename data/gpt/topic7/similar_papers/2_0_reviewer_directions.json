    "title": "Cross-domain Semi-supervised Semantic Re-ranking for Clinical Trial Matching",
    "Problem_Statement": "Patient-to-trial matching in clinical contexts suffers from limited labeled data and heterogeneous semantic descriptions, leading to suboptimal ranking models and poor replicability.",
    "Motivation": "This addresses the internal gap of fragmented integration between semantic feature learning and re-ranking models and the external gap identified from advanced semi-supervised person re-identification methods. By synthesizing semi-supervised learning techniques from video-based person re-identification with clinical re-ranking, we target improved performance with minimal labeled data.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid transformer-based re-ranking framework that incorporates semi-supervised representation learning inspired by person re-identification pipelines. Use contrastive learning with pseudo-label generation on clinical patient data, integrating semantic entity embeddings to refine patient-trial matching scores. Implement a self-paced learning curriculum to gradually increase model complexity and incorporate unlabeled samples.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect multi-modal clinical datasets for patient-trial matching (e.g., n2c2, MIMIC with trial annotations). 2) Benchmark with baseline re-ranking models without semi-supervised learning. 3) Develop semi-supervised transformer model incorporating contrastive learning and entity embeddings. 4) Evaluate using ranking metrics such as MAP, NDCG, and AUC under varying labeled data fractions. 5) Perform ablations on learning curricula and embedding configurations.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient records with sparse annotations for trial suitability; Output: Ranked list of clinical trials prioritized with improved robustness and interpretability, e.g., top-ranked trial matching patient with rare conditions verified by semantic alignment of symptoms.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If semi-supervised signals are weak, fallback to fully supervised fine-tuning with data augmentation leveraging synonym expansions and clinical ontologies. Alternatively, incorporate domain-adaptive pretraining to improve initial representations."
