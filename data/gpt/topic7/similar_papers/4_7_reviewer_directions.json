    "title": "Hybrid Symbolic-Neural Compression Framework for Explainable Multimodal Clinical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing compression methods for multimodal clinical LLMs focus on numeric parameter reduction with limited explainability and domain adaptation abilities, restricting clinician trust and reproducibility.",
    "Motivation": "Addressing the 'heterogeneous medical data' and 'AI tools' gap, this idea proposes combining symbolic knowledge representations with neural compression to preserve interpretability and enable domain-aware replication across clinical settings.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid compression framework where neural compression aggressively reduces LLM weights while a co-trained symbolic module encodes key medical relations and decision paths extracted from knowledge graphs. The symbolic module guides neural pruning decisions and provides an interpretable layer producing human-readable explanations alongside model outputs. The framework adapts to domain shifts by updating symbolic rules, keeping compressed neural parts aligned for replicable performance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Utilize multimodal medical datasets with expert-annotated clinical guidelines.\n2. Train baseline compressed LLMs.\n3. Extract symbolic rules and encode them in the framework.\n4. Jointly optimize neural compression with symbolic knowledge injection.\n5. Evaluate model accuracy, compression ratio, interpretability, and domain adaptation.\n6. Conduct clinician usability studies.\n7. Metrics include explanation fidelity, domain generalization, and compression efficiency.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient clinical notes and images.\nExpected output: Diagnosis accompanied by symbolic explanation (e.g., rule-based reasoning).\nModel achieves competitive accuracy with significantly improved interpretability scores, assisting clinical decision-making.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If integrating symbolic components degrades performance, isolate explanation modules as post-hoc interpreters. Alternatively, employ distillation of symbolic knowledge into neural embeddings. Use hybrid explanations blending statistical and rule-based insights."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed hybrid compression framework's core mechanism combining symbolic knowledge and neural pruning is promising but currently presented at a high level. The interaction between the symbolic module guiding neural pruning and co-training dynamics needs clearer specification, especially regarding how symbolic rules dynamically influence pruning decisions without causing instability or degraded performance. Detailed algorithmic descriptions, examples of symbolic rule representations, and mechanisms for joint optimization would strengthen soundness and reproducibility of the method. Clarifying how symbolic explanations are generated alongside neural outputs with fidelity guarantees will also enhance trust in the hybrid approach, especially in clinical contexts where explainability is critical. This will mitigate risks that the symbolic component becomes either superficial or overly intrusive on model capacity during compression, preserving both interpretability and accuracy effectively in practice. Please elaborate this mechanism in more technical depth and with preliminary design considerations or theoretical foundations wherever applicable in the \"Proposed_Method\" section to solidify the concept's soundness and clarity of contribution."

          "feedback_content": "The experimental plan outlines an ambitious and comprehensive set of steps, but several practical feasibility considerations require attention to make it achievable. First, the plan depends on multimodal clinical datasets with expert-annotated clinical guidelines, which are notoriously hard to procure with sufficient scale and annotation quality — this data dependency should be clarified, including planned datasets and annotation standards. Second, joint optimization of neural compression with symbolic knowledge injection is a novel and complex task; concrete strategies or baseline techniques should be proposed, for instance, specifying optimization schedules, loss functions, or hybrid training algorithms. Third, usability studies with clinicians involve significant logistical challenges — early engagement plans and success criteria should be outlined. Moreover, key evaluation metrics like explanation fidelity and domain generalization, while pertinent, need precise operational definitions and benchmark methods described. Addressing these uncertainties in the \"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\" will improve confidence that the experiments can be realistically conducted and demonstrate the proposed method's claimed benefits effectively in clinical scenarios."
