    "title": "Hybrid Human-AI Collaborative Framework for Curating Clinical Trial Queries",
    "Problem_Statement": "Automated methods for clinical trial eligibility query creation lack adaptability and contextual awareness, reducing replicability of NLP model assessments across heterogeneous datasets.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal limitations and external novel gap by coupling human-expert curation with NLP-driven query generation, leveraging human-in-the-loop query refinement from the hidden bridge between trial eligibility criteria and technical advances (Opportunity 1).",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a hybrid curation framework combining LLM-generated candidate eligibility queries with an interactive expert annotation interface. Utilize reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to optimize future query generation, enabling continuous improvement in replicability and contextual performance evaluation within clinical NLP benchmarks.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect clinical trial eligibility criteria and associated datasets; 2) Train an initial LLM-based query generator; 3) Build a user interface for expert review and feedback; 4) Implement RLHF loop for system improvement; 5) Measure replicability improvement on benchmark NLP tasks; 6) Assess user satisfaction and efficiency in query curation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Eligibility criterion 'Adult patients with uncontrolled hypertension.' Output: Initial query suggestions including synonyms and exclusion rules, refined through expert edits to yield final precise participant selection queries.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "Should RLHF convergence be slow, incorporate semi-supervised learning with larger annotated corpora or ontological constraints to bootstrap query refinement."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines an appealing hybrid approach combining LLM-generated candidate queries with human expert refinement and RLHF to improve query generation over time. However, the description lacks sufficient detail on how reinforcement signals will be operationalized and reliably captured from human feedback to guide model updates. It is unclear how the system will differentiate between expert edits that improve query validity versus those reflecting subjective preferences, as well as how it will handle inconsistencies in expert feedback. Clarifying the exact mechanisms of feedback encoding, model retraining frequency, and updating policies would strengthen confidence in the approach's soundness and reproducibility. Consider including formal definitions or algorithms for the RLHF loop and quality control procedures for human input integration within the Proposed_Method section. This will better ensure the system's learning process is well-founded and logically consistent with expert improvements in query curation, thus addressing potential pitfalls in model convergence and performance gains."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan provides a reasonable high-level workflow but lacks critical scientific rigor and practical details necessary to evaluate feasibility thoroughly. Key gaps include absence of explicit criteria for dataset selection and size (e.g., diversity of clinical trials and dataset heterogeneity), metrics for measuring replicability improvements (quantitative benchmarks or statistical tests), and specifics on how user satisfaction and efficiency will be quantitatively assessed (e.g., standardized surveys, time-to-completion measures). The plan also does not address potential ethical considerations or data privacy challenges common in clinical data use, which may impact feasibility. Further, the fallback plan's alternative approaches (semi-supervised learning, ontological constraints) need elaboration on integration with the main system and assessment methods. To improve, the authors should specify concrete measurable outcomes, validation protocols, data governance strategies, and timelines reflecting operational feasibility within realistic clinical NLP settings."
