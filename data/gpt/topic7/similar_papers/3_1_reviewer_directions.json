    "title": "Collaborative Bias Auditing and Transparency Toolkits for Clinician-Patient Co-Designed LLM Interfaces",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM clinical support systems lack transparency mechanisms co-designed with both clinicians and patients to effectively mitigate bias and foster equitable healthcare AI usage.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the critical siloing identified between co-design and clinician-patient interactions (Internal Gaps) and targets Opportunity 2 to collaboratively develop bias mitigation and transparency tools that are context-aware and aligned with stakeholder needs.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an interactive bias auditing toolkit within clinical LLM interfaces co-designed via multi-stakeholder workshops. The toolkit visualizes AI decision rationales, surfaces provenance of outputs, and highlights potential bias flags contextualized to patient demographics. This interface is augmented by explainable AI modules customized to clinician and patient literacy levels, enabling co-learning and bias reduction in real-time support scenarios.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multi-modal datasets including clinician notes, patient demographics, and AI output rationales; 2. Develop baseline LLM clinical support without transparency aids; 3. Conduct co-design workshops to shape toolkit functionalities and UI/UX; 4. Integrate explainability and bias detection modules into LLM APIs; 5. Evaluate impact through controlled user studies measuring bias perception, trust, and decision accuracy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM suggests medication alternative for Patient C who belongs to an underserved minority group. Toolkit highlights bias flags indicating underrepresentation in training data and shows explanation for suggestion. Expected Output: Clinician identifies potential bias, adjusts recommendation accordingly, and patient is more informed and trusts the AI support.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time bias detection is challenging, implement post-hoc transparency reports; if user studies indicate UI complexity is a barrier, apply iterative simplifications focusing on core bias insights."

          "feedback_content": "The Experiment Plan is comprehensive but may underestimate the complexity and resource demands of several key steps, such as collecting sufficiently diverse, multimodal datasets that accurately capture patient demographics and clinician notes, as well as integrating explainability and bias detection modules effectively into LLM APIs. Moreover, co-design workshops with multiple stakeholders and controlled user studies involving sensitive clinical environments require extensive ethical review and recruitment efforts which should be explicitly acknowledged and planned for. To improve feasibility, the plan should include clear milestones, risk mitigation strategies for data access and privacy concerns, and contingency protocols if initial modules fail to integrate as expected in clinical workflows. Additionally, consider piloting with a narrower clinical domain or specific biases before scaling up to ensure iterative refinement and practical deployment readiness. This will strengthen confidence in the stepwise approach and eventual impact evaluation outcomes within realistic resource constraints and regulatory landscapes, increasing overall project feasibility and scientific rigor in execution planning.\n\nSuggested Action: Include detailed timelines, data privacy and IRB considerations, incremental deployment phases, and fallback mechanisms beyond UI simplifications to anticipate implementation challenges early on, enhancing operational feasibility and scientific soundness of the experiment plan.  \n\n [FEA-EXPERIMENT]  (Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)  "

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating, the project could gain substantial value and increased impact by integrating related concepts like 'medical AI systems', 'human-AI interaction design', and 'privacy-preserving methods' explicitly into the toolkit design. For example, incorporating attribute-based or role-based access controls (e.g., RBAC) could enrich the transparency toolkit by tailoring bias audit visualizations and explanations based on clinician roles or patient consent preferences, enhancing privacy and ethical safeguards. Aligning the toolkit development with international health system standards and involving diverse clinical settings (e.g., University Clinics of Kinshasa) could broaden applicability and global relevance. Additionally, embedding mechanisms to manage sensitive information while accommodating variable user trust levels can improve real-world acceptance and adoption. By proactively connecting with these globally linked themes, the research could differentiate itself with system-level integration that addresses complexity and privacy in healthcare AI, thereby elevating both novelty and potential impact substantially.\n\nSuggested Action: Augment the research scope to explicitly explore and prototype privacy-preserving bias auditing through access control mechanisms and expand user experience customization via human-AI interaction design principles drawn from the referenced global domains.\n\n [SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION]  (Sections: Proposed_Method & Experiment_Plan)"
