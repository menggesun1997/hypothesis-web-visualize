These models are typically built on architectures like transformers. The term “large” indicates that the neural network has a significant number of parameters, making it more powerful and capable of capturing complex patterns in language. One notable example of a large language model is ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like text. It can be trained on a variety of tasks, such as language translation, question answering, and text completion. One of the key features of ChatGPT is its ability to understand and respond to natural language inputs. This makes it a powerful tool for generating a wide range of text, including medical reports, surgical notes, and even poetry. Additionally, the model has been trained on a large corpus of text, which allows it to generate text that is both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. In terms of applications in neurosurgery, ChatGPT can be used to generate detailed and accurate surgical reports, which can be very useful for sharing information about a patient’s case with other members of the medical team. Additionally, the model can be used to generate detailed surgical notes, which can be very useful for training and educating residents and medical students. Overall, LLMs have the potential to be a valuable tool in the field of neurosurgery. Indeed, this abstract has been generated by ChatGPT within few seconds. Potential applications and pitfalls of the applications of LLMs are discussed in this paper.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Economics and Equity of Large Language Models: Health Care Perspective', 'abstract': 'Large language models (LLMs) continue to exhibit noteworthy capabilities across a spectrum of areas, including emerging proficiencies across the health care continuum. Successful LLM implementation and adoption depend on digital readiness, modern infrastructure, a trained workforce, privacy, and an ethical regulatory landscape. These factors can vary significantly across health care ecosystems, dictating the choice of a particular LLM implementation pathway. This perspective discusses 3 LLM implementation pathways-training from scratch pathway (TSP), fine-tuned pathway (FTP), and out-of-the-box pathway (OBP)-as potential onboarding points for health systems while facilitating equitable adoption. The choice of a particular pathway is governed by needs as well as affordability. Therefore, the risks, benefits, and economics of these pathways across 4 major cloud service providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle) are presented. While cost comparisons, such as on-demand and spot pricing across the cloud service providers for the 3 pathways, are presented for completeness, the usefulness of managed services and cloud enterprise tools is elucidated. Managed services can complement the traditional workforce and expertise, while enterprise tools, such as federated learning, can overcome sample size challenges when implementing LLMs using health care data. Of the 3 pathways, TSP is expected to be the most resource-intensive regarding infrastructure and workforce while providing maximum customization, enhanced transparency, and performance. Because TSP trains the LLM using enterprise health care data, it is expected to harness the digital signatures of the population served by the health care system with the potential to impact outcomes. The use of pretrained models in FTP is a limitation. It may impact its performance because the training data used in the pretrained model may have hidden bias and may not necessarily be health care-related. However, FTP provides a balance between customization, cost, and performance. While OBP can be rapidly deployed, it provides minimal customization and transparency without guaranteeing long-term availability. OBP may also present challenges in interfacing seamlessly with downstream applications in health care settings with variations in pricing and use over time. Lack of customization in OBP can significantly limit its ability to impact outcomes. Finally, potential applications of LLMs in health care, including conversational artificial intelligence, chatbots, summarization, and machine translation, are highlighted. While the 3 implementation pathways discussed in this perspective have the potential to facilitate equitable adoption and democratization of LLMs, transitions between them may be necessary as the needs of health systems evolve. Understanding the economics and trade-offs of these onboarding pathways can guide their strategic adoption and demonstrate value while impacting health care outcomes favorably.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Safeguarding human values: rethinking US law for generative AI’s societal impacts', 'abstract': 'Our interdisciplinary study examines the effectiveness of US law in addressing the complex challenges posed by generative AI systems to fundamental human values, including physical and mental well-being, privacy, autonomy, diversity, and equity. Through the analysis of diverse hypothetical scenarios developed in collaboration with experts, we identified significant shortcomings and ambiguities within the existing legal protections. Constitutional and civil rights law currently struggles to hold AI companies responsible for AI-assisted discriminatory outputs. Moreover, even without considering the liability shield provided by Section 230, existing liability laws may not effectively remedy unintentional and intangible harms caused by AI systems. Demonstrating causal links for liability claims such as defamation or product liability proves exceptionally difficult due to the intricate and opaque nature of these systems. To effectively address these unique and evolving risks posed by generative AI, we propose a “Responsible AI Legal Framework”  that adapts to recognize new threats and utilizes a multi-pronged approach. This framework would\\xa0enshrine fundamental values in legal frameworks, establish comprehensive safety guidelines, and implement liability models tailored to the complexities of human-AI interactions. By proactively mitigating unforeseen harms like mental health impacts and privacy breaches, this framework aims to create a legal landscape capable of navigating the exciting\\xa0yet precarious future brought forth by generative AI technologies.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'Tribulations and future opportunities for artificial intelligence in precision medicine', 'abstract': \"Upon a diagnosis, the clinical team faces two main questions: what treatment, and at what dose? Clinical trials' results provide the basis for guidance and support for official protocols that clinicians use to base their decisions. However, individuals do not consistently demonstrate the reported response from relevant clinical trials. The decision complexity increases with combination treatments where drugs administered together can interact with each other, which is often the case. Additionally, the individual's response to the treatment varies with the changes in their condition. In practice, the drug and the dose selection depend significantly on the medical protocol and the medical team's experience. As such, the results are inherently varied and often suboptimal. Big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have emerged as excellent decision-making tools, but multiple challenges limit their application. AI is a rapidly evolving and dynamic field with the potential to revolutionize various aspects of human life. AI has become increasingly crucial in drug discovery and development. AI enhances decision-making across different disciplines, such as medicinal chemistry, molecular and cell biology, pharmacology, pathology, and clinical practice. In addition to these, AI contributes to patient population selection and stratification. The need for AI in healthcare is evident as it aids in enhancing data accuracy and ensuring the quality care necessary for effective patient treatment. AI is pivotal in improving success rates in clinical practice. The increasing significance of AI in drug discovery, development, and clinical trials is underscored by many scientific publications. Despite the numerous advantages of AI, such as enhancing and advancing Precision Medicine (PM) and remote patient monitoring, unlocking its full potential in healthcare requires addressing fundamental concerns. These concerns include data quality, the lack of well-annotated large datasets, data privacy and safety issues, biases in AI algorithms, legal and ethical challenges, and obstacles related to cost and implementation. Nevertheless, integrating AI in clinical medicine will improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes, contribute to more efficient healthcare delivery, reduce costs, and facilitate better patient experiences, making healthcare more sustainable. This article reviews AI applications in drug development and clinical practice, making healthcare more sustainable, and highlights concerns and limitations in applying AI.\"}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Principles, applications, and future of artificial intelligence in dermatology', 'abstract': 'This paper provides an overview of artificial-intelligence (AI), as applied to dermatology.
