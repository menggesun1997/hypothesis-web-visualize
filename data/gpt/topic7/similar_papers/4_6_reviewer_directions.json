    "title": "Bias-Aware Domain Generalization in Compressed LLMs via Fairness-Regularized Knowledge Injection",
    "Problem_Statement": "Compressed LLMs deployed in clinical domains often exhibit unrecognized biases due to domain shifts, reducing fairness and trustworthiness in heterogeneous medical data environments.",
    "Motivation": "This proposal addresses the gap combining heterogeneous medical data, AI tools, and fairness by injecting fairness-aware knowledge derived from curated domain graphs into compressed LLMs for better domain generalization and bias mitigation.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct domain-specific fairness knowledge graphs encoding relationships between protected attributes and clinical outcomes. Inject these during compressed LLM finetuning via graph-aware attention modules regularized to minimize predicted biases. Introduce fairness metrics into loss functions to calibrate model outputs uniformly across subgroups. Continuous monitoring with automated bias detection triggers knowledge graph updates embedded within AI tool pipelines for transparency and adaptability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multi-domain datasets with annotated demographics.\n2. Build fairness knowledge graphs per domain.\n3. Finetune compressed LLMs with graph injections.\n4. Measure fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds), accuracy, and calibration.\n5. Compare with standard compressed LLMs.\n6. Validate deployment integration with clinical workflows.\n7. Test continual bias monitoring and correction.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical records with demographic fields.\nExpected output: LLM predictions exhibit reduced disparate impact and balanced error rates across age and ethnicity.\nModel outputs include interpretability reports citing fairness graph influence.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If graph injection limits model capacity, explore knowledge distillation from fairness-enhanced teacher models. Alternatively, use adversarial debiasing post-processing layers. Develop user feedback loops to fine-tune fairness constraints."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines injecting fairness knowledge graphs into compressed LLMs via graph-aware attention modules and fairness-regularized loss functions. However, the mechanism details lack clarity on how the attention modules effectively integrate heterogeneous graph structures with textual LLM representations, especially considering compression constraints. The process by which fairness metrics guide the regularization and how continuous graph updates interplay with model stability is also under-specified. To strengthen soundness, concretely define the architectural integration, elaborating how the graph embeddings interact with language model layers, and specify the mathematical formulation for fairness loss regularization and its optimization during finetuning. This clarity is critical to assess whether the approach can truly mitigate biases without impairing model capacity or causing instability in compressed models under domain shifts, particularly in high-stakes clinical contexts. This targeted enhancement will elevate confidence in the methodological rigor and reproducibility of the approach within the compressed LLM fairness domain, which is notably complex and competitive due to existing strong baselines and approaches in graph neural networks and bias mitigation literature.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is comprehensive but ambitious, spanning data collection, graph construction, model finetuning, comprehensive evaluation, workflow integration, and continual bias monitoring. However, it currently lacks detailed plans addressing challenges in feasibility such as annotating demographics consistently across heterogeneous clinical datasets, validating the quality and coverage of fairness knowledge graphs, and examples of concrete evaluation protocols for interpretability reports. Moreover, clinical deployment integration and continuous monitoring imply operational challenges (e.g., latency, user feedback mechanisms) that are underexplored. To improve feasibility, add explicit milestones with contingency strategies for data quality gaps, model capacity issues due to graph injections, and system latency constraints during real-world deployment. Incorporate metrics such as inference latency and consider benchmarking with real-time clinical tool constraints. Clarify dataset sizes and selection criteria, and plan for incremental validations rather than end-to-end immediate deployments. This will make the experiment plan more robust, scientifically credible, and implementable in the complex, regulated clinical environment targeted by the proposal."
