        "title": "Explainable Multi-Modal LLM Validation Pipeline with ICU Domain Adaptation and Regulatory Compliance Auditing",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM validation approaches in clinical NLP often lack transparent explainability and fail to robustly address complex regulatory compliance requirements, particularly across diverse jurisdictions. Moreover, these approaches largely omit high-stakes clinical environments such as the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where multi-modal data integration and explainability are critical for trustworthy AI-supported clinical decisions.",
        "Motivation": "This proposal responds to critical gaps in interpretable, reproducible LLM validation by designing an explainability-first validation pipeline tailored for clinical NLP that explicitly supports regulatory compliance auditing with jurisdictional nuance. By incorporating multi-modal clinical data—including ICU-specific notes, omics data, and bioinformatics-derived features—and adapting to clinical decision support system contexts, this work aims to enhance trustworthiness and auditability of AI models under stringent, evolving regulatory frameworks. The inclusion of modular, expert-informed compliance checks and collaboration with regulatory specialists sets this pipeline apart from previous work, addressing NOV-COMPETITIVE concerns and aiming to elevate clinical AI validation in high-impact, real-world settings.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular, extensible validation pipeline architecture that: (1) explicitly targets primary regulatory frameworks (e.g., FDA AI/ML-Based Software as a Medical Device guidelines, EU MDR, and HIPAA), with mechanisms to incorporate jurisdiction-specific compliance rules; (2) integrates explainability modules including attention visualization, feature importance scoring, and rule-based diagnostics applied to multi-modal data streams (clinical notes, omics datasets, bioinformatics features) particularly from ICU domains; (3) embeds traceable provenance and audit trails supporting incremental model updates and validation steps; (4) synergizes large language model outputs with rule-based systems and bioinformatics tools to improve interpretability and regulatory audit readiness; (5) facilitates direct collaboration workflows with regulatory experts for semi-automated compliance assessment; and (6) supports benchmarking on a suite of clinical decision support tasks including ICU patient risk stratification and clinical trial eligibility. This approach explicitly complements—rather than replaces—expert regulatory review, emphasizing transparency and adaptability under real-world regulatory complexity and evolving standards.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Conduct comprehensive survey and mapping of relevant regulatory frameworks (FDA, EU MDR, HIPAA) including jurisdictional variances and expert consultations to define concrete compliance criteria. 2) Develop advanced explainability modules focusing on multi-modal data, incorporating LLM attention analysis, omics-informed feature importance, and rule-based system outputs with ICU domain customization. 3) Construct the modular pipeline integrating these explainability components alongside provenance logging and compliance checking mechanisms. 4) Validate the pipeline on retrospective multi-modal ICU clinical NLP datasets (patient notes, omics data), focusing on clinical decision support scenarios including trial eligibility and patient risk evaluation. 5) Engage regulatory and clinical experts in iterative user studies and pilot audits to refine compliance checks and usability, explicitly accounting for ambiguities and jurisdiction-specific expectations. 6) Benchmark auditability, reproducibility, and clinical utility improvements against existing validation frameworks to demonstrate methodological superiority and real-world applicability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: ICU patient multi-modal data including clinical notes, genomics profiles, and bioinformatics annotations for clinical trial eligibility prediction or patient deterioration risk assessment. Output: Comprehensive explainability and compliance report detailing key influential tokens and features, rule-based system corroborations, visualizations of multi-modal feature importance, traceable audit logs, and clear regulatory compliance outcomes contextualized by jurisdiction. The report includes flags or notes where expert review remains necessary, ensuring transparency and practical regulatory alignment.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full automation of regulatory compliance checks proves infeasible given complex and evolving standards, we will emphasize semi-automated audit reporting tools integrated into the pipeline, supported by structured expert review workflows. A phased implementation strategy will prioritize simpler regulatory domains and clinical tasks before extending to the full ICU and multi-modal settings. Continuous collaboration with regulatory partners will guide iterative enhancement and adoption."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that an explainability-first validation pipeline can fully satisfy regulatory compliance requirements needs clearer substantiation. Regulatory standards in clinical AI are rapidly evolving and often ambiguous, and the proposal does not clearly discuss handling ambiguities or differences across jurisdictions. It is recommended to explicitly specify which regulatory frameworks are targeted and provide initial evidence of how the explainability modules effectively satisfy those specific requirements to strengthen the assumption's validity and practical relevance in the clinical NLP domain. This will help avoid overpromising compliance without rigorous grounding in regulatory realities and increase the proposal's soundness and credibility across clinical research environments that differ in regulatory expectations. This also aligns with clarifying how the pipeline complements, rather than replaces, expert regulatory review, especially given the fallback plan's semi-automated checks approach. Consider collaboration with regulatory experts early in the design phase and pilot validation to refine assumptions embedded in the pipeline's architecture and compliance checking modules to ensure robustness of the core concept under real-world regulatory stringency and complexity constraints, which are hinted at but not sufficiently detailed today in the Method description and Experiment Plan sections (Step 1 and 5)."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "To enhance both novelty and impact given the pre-screened classification as NOV-COMPETITIVE, integrating domain-relevant concepts such as 'Intensive Care Unit domain' and 'clinical decision support systems' could significantly broaden the proposal's scope and applicability. For example, by adapting the explainable validation pipeline to handle multi-modal clinical data including omics data types and patient notes from ICU settings, the method could address urgent needs for transparent, trustworthy AI under high-stakes conditions. Incorporating bioinformatics tools and rule-based systems alongside LLM outputs may bolster explainability and compliance auditing sophistication, leading to richer, actionable insights for clinicians and regulators alike. This integration would also facilitate benchmarking on a wider set of clinical NLP tasks beyond trial eligibility, thereby elevating the innovation's competitiveness and practical contribution. I propose the team investigate how to embed such modular expansions early in the pipeline design, including mechanisms to visualize or quantify feature importance respecting omics and ICU-specific data characteristics, thus broadening impact and enhancing cross-disciplinary adoption potential as suggested in the global concepts list."
