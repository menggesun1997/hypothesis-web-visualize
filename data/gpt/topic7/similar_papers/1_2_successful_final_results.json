        "title": "Adaptive Hybrid Explainable Compression for Context-Aware Lightweight LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current models struggle to simultaneously achieve lightweight deployment, high interpretability, and replicable performance in diverse, resource-constrained environments. Existing explainable compression approaches lack adaptive mechanisms that tailor explanations according to deployment context and user expertise, limiting practical usability and trustworthiness across intelligent agent scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "While hybrid architectures combining knowledge distillation with explainability have been explored, their interaction mechanisms and optimization strategies are often underspecified, hindering reproducibility and adoption. To surpass the NOV-COMPETITIVE baseline, this proposal introduces a novel adaptive framework that dynamically modulates explanation granularity and modality based on deployment conditions and user roles. By integrating meta-learning-driven explanation policies, the approach advances the state of deployable, explainable AI agents, addressing an internal gap at the intersection of Explainable AI, AI application, and intelligent agent deployment.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a hybrid architecture combining a distilled LLM backbone with an adaptive explainability layer governed by a meta-learned explanation policy. The iterative joint optimization pipeline proceeds as follows:\n\n1) Distillation Phase: Compress large LLMs into compact models optimized for semantic retention via a multi-objective loss balancing cross-entropy with a semantic similarity regularizer.\n\n2) Explainability Module Integration: Incorporate a transparent, modular explanation layer providing feature attribution, attention visualizations, and symbolic explanations. This layer's parameters and logic are dynamically modulated by an explanation policy network trained via meta-learning to optimize explanation fidelity, relevance, and resource-awareness.\n\n3) Explanation Policy Learning: Employ meta-learning with deployment context features (e.g., device capability, user expertise level) as inputs to learn adaptable explanation granularity and modality, ensuring that the explanations are as informative as possible under varying constraints.\n\n4) Joint Training Loop: Alternate optimization steps between the distilled model (for accuracy and size), explainability modules (for interpretability metrics like feature attribution fidelity), and the explanation policy network (for adaptation performance), ensuring balanced trade-offs without sacrificing reasoning capacity.\n\n5) Deployment-aware Evaluation: Benchmark on real-world resource-constrained devices and diverse user profiles using metrics spanning replicability, interpretability, latency, and user satisfaction.\n\nThis architecture is supplemented by architectural diagrams and pseudo-code describing data flow between components and optimization routines, ensuring reproducibility and clarity. The integration of meta-learning-driven adaptive explanation policies and multi-objective optimization distinguishes this approach from existing works, fundamentally enhancing deployability and user alignment.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Develop distilled LLM variants using multi-objective distillation loss balancing accuracy and semantic retention.\n2) Design modular explainability components: attention heatmaps, symbolic rule extractor, and feature attribution methods compatible with the distilled backbone.\n3) Implement an explanation policy network trained via meta-learning, taking deployment context as input and outputting explanation configuration parameters.\n4) Establish an iterative joint training procedure that cycles between optimizing the LLM, explainability modules, and explanation policy network, carefully monitoring metrics to avoid degradation.\n5) Conduct extensive benchmarking on multiple edge hardware platforms with varied computational budgets and user expertise classes.\n6) Execute user studies with participants of different backgrounds to assess explanation effectiveness, trust, and usability.\n7) Analyze trade-offs between model compactness, replicability, interpretability, and adaptability of explanations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Short diagnostic medical notes processed on an edge device with limited resources.\nExpected output: Accurate, replicable diagnostic prediction.\nAdaptive explanation: For expert users, detailed symbolic rules combined with attention visualization highlighting critical text spans; for novices, simplified, natural language explanations emphasizing key clinical features.\nAll explanations remain consistent under slight input perturbations and varying deployment conditions, demonstrating robustness.\n\nInput: Incident reports analyzed by intelligent agents within a communication network.\nExpected output: Correct classification alongside context-adapted explanations modulated for different agent roles (e.g., operator vs. automated monitoring) reflecting resource constraints and user needs.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the integrated joint optimization proves infeasible or degrades model accuracy, fallback strategies include:\n- Decoupling training phases: first finalize distilled model and explainability modules independently, followed by offline tuning of explanation policies.\n- Employing model-agnostic post-hoc explainers with meta-learning-based adaptive explanation selection.\n- Prioritizing robustness and replicability improvements in the distilled backbone before integrating adaptive explanations.\nContinued refinement of modularity enables iterative enhancements toward joint optimization as future work."
