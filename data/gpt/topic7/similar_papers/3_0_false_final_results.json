    "title": "Adaptive Patient-Centric Attribute-Based Access Control via Co-Design",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current attribute-based access control models in healthcare are static and often fail to dynamically reflect individual patient privacy preferences, leading to trust deficits and potential data misuse especially when integrated with LLM systems.",
    "Motivation": "This research addresses the External/Novel Gap of integrating co-design with attribute-based access control (Opportunity 1) to create adaptive models that personalize access control in real-time, enhancing patient trust and data security beyond existing static frameworks.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a co-design driven adaptive attribute-based access control (CA-ABAC) framework that incorporates patient and clinician feedback through interactive interfaces to dynamically adjust access policies. The framework utilizes a reinforcement learning agent that personalizes access rules by learning from ongoing preference signals and clinician-patient interaction patterns, integrated directly with LLM-powered EHR query and generation modules.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate a dataset combining EHR access logs, simulated patient privacy preferences, and clinician-patient interaction transcripts; 2. Implement baseline static ABAC systems for comparison; 3. Develop the CA-ABAC prototype with RL-driven policy adaptation informed by co-design session data; 4. Evaluate privacy preservation, patient satisfaction (via surveys), access granularity, and trust metrics across simulated clinical scenarios; 5. Perform ablations to isolate co-design feedback impact.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient A prefers family members to access only summary health info but allows full data to designated clinicians; Clinician B requests access for treatment. The system dynamically updates access rights so Clinician B accesses full data while family gets summaries, reflecting patient preferences in real-time. Expected Output: Access logs show selective data exposure per updated policies; Patient surveys indicate increased trust.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If RL adaptation proves unstable, fallback to a rule-based system incorporating preference clusters derived from co-design workshops; if user feedback integration lags, simulate preference updates via synthetic user modeling and iterate from there."
