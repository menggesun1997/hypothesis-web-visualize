    "title": "Vision Transformer-based Flow Embeddings for Multi-modal Temporal Clinical Data Interpretation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing clinical decision support systems lack robust context-aware embeddings that capture temporal and multi-modal patient data, limiting differential diagnosis accuracy and interpretability.",
    "Motivation": "Building on the external gap signaling opportunities to leverage flow embeddings and Vision Transformer architectures from computer vision into clinical settings, this idea aims to advance interpretability and replicability in medical AI.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework that encodes temporal sequences of heterogeneous patient data (imaging, lab results, clinical notes) into unified flow embeddings. Utilize spatiotemporal attention mechanisms to model dynamic feature interactions over time, enabling context-aware differential diagnosis and clinical decision support with visualizable decision paths.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Acquire multi-modal temporal datasets (e.g., longitudinal patient records, imaging sequences). 2) Baseline against recurrent and transformer-based models without flow embeddings. 3) Implement ViT-based flow embedding extractor with temporal self-attention layers. 4) Train end-to-end diagnostic classifiers on common disease prediction tasks. 5) Evaluate performance, interpretability, and replicability across datasets with clinical expert review.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A time-series of patient lab tests, clinical notes, and imaging modalities; Output: Diagnostic predictions with attention maps highlighting influential timepoints and modalities, facilitating clinician validation and trust.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If ViT modeling is computationally prohibitive, simplify with hierarchical transformers or hybrid CNN-transformer architectures. Alternatively, isolate modality-specific flow embedding modules before late fusion."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines using Vision Transformer-based flow embeddings for multi-modal temporal clinical data, but the mechanism for handling highly heterogeneous data types (imaging, lab results, clinical notes) within a unified ViT framework is insufficiently detailed. It is unclear how the model preprocesses and embeds non-image data such as clinical notes and lab values into a flow embedding compatible with ViT's typical image token inputs. Moreover, the incorporation of spatiotemporal attention across modalities and time requires explicit architectural details to ensure soundness. Clarifying how the flow embeddings are constructed, how spatiotemporal dependencies are captured across diverse data types, and how attention operates over this multimodal sequence will strengthen the method's conceptual grounding and reproducibility."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty is assessed as NOV-COMPETITIVE and that the field already has strong multimodal and transformer-based clinical models, integrating domain-specific explainability methods from Explainable AI (e.g., attention visualization techniques tailored for clinical data) could elevate impact and distinctiveness. Further, leveraging self-supervised loss objectives on multimodal temporal data before supervised classification could improve representation quality and robustness, distinguishing it from existing models. Suggestions include incorporating functional magnetic resonance imaging data if available, or radiology report generation modules to provide complementary textual insights, deepening multimodal fusion. These enhancements can broaden impact, improve interpretability, and align the work with contemporary advances in clinical decision support systems."
