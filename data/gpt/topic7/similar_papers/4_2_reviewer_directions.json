    "title": "Domain-Adaptive Knowledge Graph Embedded AI Tool Pipeline for Clinical LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Compressed LLMs deployed across diverse clinical domains often lack sustained robustness, interpretability, and fairness due to domain shifts and bias, limiting trustworthiness and replicability in practice.",
    "Motivation": "This idea addresses the gaps connecting 'heterogeneous medical data' and 'AI tools' by embedding domain-adaptive knowledge graphs and fairness-aware calibration into AI tool pipelines, enhancing reproducibility and clinical acceptance of compressed LLMs under domain heterogeneity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an AI tool development pipeline that integrates domain-specific, dynamically updated knowledge graphs constructed from medical ontologies and electronic health records. Couple with a modular calibrator applying fairness-aware post-processing on compressed LLM predictions, adjusting decision thresholds per domain identified via metadata. Incorporate continual domain adaptation loops where feedback from clinician user interface guides knowledge graph refinement and model recalibration. Enable transparency modules that visualize knowledge graph influence alongside prediction to foster interpretability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use datasets representing multiple clinical specialties with annotated bias metrics.\n2. Build compressed baseline LLM diagnostic models.\n3. Construct domain-specific knowledge graphs with public ontologies (UMLS) and site data.\n4. Integrate modular fairness-aware calibrators.\n5. Conduct cross-domain validation assessing robustness, calibration error, fairness metrics (e.g., equal opportunity).\n6. Deploy a prototype AI tool interface for clinician feedback collection.\n7. Metrics include AUROC, calibration curves, subgroup performance, interpretability scores.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Lab tests and clinical notes from cardiology and oncology domains.\nExpected output: Diagnosis with fairness-calibrated confidence scores, accompanied by knowledge graph subgraphs highlighting contributing factors.\nDemonstrate improved fairness across age and gender subgroups compared to uncalibrated compressed LLM.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If knowledge graph integration reduces model responsiveness, consider distilled knowledge graphs extracting key relations only. If fairness-calibration overcorrects inducing bias, integrate adversarial debiasing techniques or more granular subgroup-aware calibration layers."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method integrates several complex components—domain-specific knowledge graphs, fairness-aware calibrators, and continual adaptation loops—but the mechanism linking these components is described at a high level without enough specificity. For instance, it is unclear how knowledge graph influence is quantitatively integrated with compressed LLM predictions, how fairness calibration thresholds adapt per domain metadata, and how clinician feedback concretely updates the knowledge graphs and recalibration models. To improve, explicitly detail the data flow and algorithmic steps connecting these modules, including mathematical formulations or pseudo-code as feasible, to better demonstrate soundness and reproducibility of the approach. Clarifying these mechanisms will also help anticipate integration challenges and validate assumptions underlying model behavior and fairness outcomes in clinical contexts, strengthening the technical contribution and reviewer confidence in feasibility and efficacy of the method early on. This clarity is critical given the pipeline complexity and the interplay of interpretability, fairness, and domain adaptation objectives in safety-critical medical AI applications, where subtle architectural or algorithmic design decisions substantially impact trustworthiness and deployment readiness. Please revise the Proposed_Method section to explicitly address these points with actionable procedural detail and schematic illustrations if possible, to clarify how each component interfaces and synergizes leading to improved robustness and fairness under domain shifts in compressed clinical LLM deployment scenarios. This enhanced clarity will also scaffold your subsequent experimentation sections and justify chosen evaluation metrics and baselines with respect to each modular component's role and contribution. Overall, the idea's novelty and promise necessitate a more compelling and transparent exposition of the method's inner workings to be deemed sound and actionable by the community and potential clinical adopters alike.  This should be the highest priority revision in terms of soundness and clarity before experimental refinement or broader impact discussions are addressed.  \n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan provides a reasonable sequential strategy but appears ambitious and complex relative to its early-stage research proposal status, risking over-extension and unclear success criteria. Several key feasibility details are missing or under-specified: (a) The plan to construct \"domain-specific knowledge graphs\" combining public ontologies and site-specific EHR data needs further operationalization—what specific datasets and granularity levels will be used; how will dynamic updates be validated? (b) Fairness-aware calibrators are described conceptually but without specifying which calibration algorithms or baseline fairness assessment frameworks will be used; integration with compressed LLM diagnostics also needs clarity on computational overhead and expected stability. (c) The clinical user feedback loop and interface prototyping represent substantial ethnographic and HCI work, generally challenging within a typical research cycle and requiring domain expert collaboration and IRB protocols—these logistical considerations are not addressed. (d) Validation metrics list includes interpretability scores and subgroup fairness measures but lacks a mention of appropriate statistical tests and uncertainty quantification plans to establish significance. To enhance feasibility, please prioritize and more concretely scope the experiments: for example, initially decouple knowledge graph integration from fairness calibration to isolate effects, perform offline evaluations on well-curated datasets, and run preliminary clinician feedback through simplified simulators or questionnaires before full interface deployment. Strengthening the experimental design with detailed dataset access plans, modular evaluation protocols, defined success criteria, and timelines will improve robustness and reproducibility. Addressing these aspects will help reviewers and funding bodies gauge practical deliverability and impact prospects, ensuring the project’s ambition aligns with realistic capabilities and resource availability. This refinement in experimental scope and documentation should be a key next step to ensure the technical contributions can be convincingly demonstrated in the competitive and safety-critical domain of clinical AI.  \n\n"
