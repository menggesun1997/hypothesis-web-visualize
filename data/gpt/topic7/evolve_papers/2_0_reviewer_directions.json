    "title": "Multiobjective Genetic Optimization for Replicable LLM Fine-Tuning and Prompting",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current replicability research on LLMs overlooks multi-dimensional evaluation that balances performance, robustness, and reproducibility when using fine-tuning versus prompt engineering. This single-objective focus limits reliable deployment.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap on lacking explicit multiobjective replicability criteria and the first high-potential innovation opportunity by developing a comprehensive framework integrating NSGA-II-inspired optimization into LLM pipelines for replicability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multiobjective optimization framework embedding a NSGA-II genetic algorithm to jointly optimize fine-tuning hyperparameters and prompt templates. The framework evaluates candidate solutions on accuracy, robustness to distribution shifts, and replicability metrics (e.g., experimental variance). It maintains a Pareto front of optimal trade-offs, guiding users toward configurations maximizing multi-dimensional replicability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select datasets from natural language understanding benchmarks (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE). 2. Use open-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-2, T5). 3. Compare fine-tuning and prompt engineering individually and combined. 4. Implement NSGA-II optimization framework to generate hyperparameter and prompt sets. 5. Baselines include standard single-objective tuning and manual prompt engineering. 6. Metrics: accuracy, robustness (e.g., adversarial and out-of-distribution tests), replicability (variance over multiple runs).",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: The prompt \"Summarize the following article\" optimized for joint objectives; Dataset: CNN/Daily Mail summarization; Expected Output: A summary with high ROUGE score, consistent quality across multiple runs, and stable performance under phrasing variations in prompts.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If multiobjective optimization does not converge or yields trivial solutions, fallback includes simplifying objectives or applying surrogate models for fitness estimation. Debugging involves ablation studies to evaluate objective importance and redesigning mutation strategies for genetic diversity."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan effectively outlines datasets, models, and metrics that align with the multiobjective optimization goals. However, it lacks clarity on the computational feasibility and complexity of implementing NSGA-II over large hyperparameter and prompt template spaces, especially for resource-intensive LLMs like T5. The plan should concretely address resource requirements, expected runtime, and strategies to scale or approximate the search (e.g., surrogate modeling, pruning) to ensure practical feasibility of experiments within typical project timelines and computational budgets. Additionally, details on robustness evaluation (types of distribution shifts and adversarial methods) could be better specified for reproducibility and clarity of claims. Strengthening these aspects will improve confidence in the proposed experimental validation's completeness and robustness under real-world constraints, which is critical for replicability research focused on multiobjective dimensions. This refinement fits under [FEA-EXPERIMENT]."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment identifies the idea as NOV-COMPETITIVE due to strong overlaps between multiobjective genetic optimization and LLM tuning/prompting literature, integrating concepts from the 'Search-Based Software Engineering' (SBSE) field could provide distinctive novelty and impact. For instance, framing the NSGA-II optimization within an SBSE perspective that emphasizes software engineering metrics related to model deployment, maintainability, or interpretability could expand the multiobjective criteria beyond purely performance, robustness, and replicability metrics. This integration can foster cross-disciplinary insights and align fine-tuning and prompting optimizations with software process improvements valued at venues like ICSE or related AI-for-SE workshops. Adding such software lifecycle-aware objectives and evaluation methods would broaden impact, enhance novelty, and increase relevance for both AI and software engineering communities. This suggestion corresponds to [SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION]."
