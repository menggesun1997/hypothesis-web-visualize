    "title": "Personalized Evaluation Metrics Inspired by Affective Neuroscience for NLP Models",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current performance replicability assessments overlook diversity in user interaction contexts and psychological factors influencing perceived model quality, limiting external validity across populations.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap linking psychological and biomedical constructs to LLM evaluation, specifically leveraging analogies from 'positive/negative affect' and user contextual variability to personalize evaluation metrics enhancing deployment relevance.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a Personalized Evaluation Framework (PEF) that models user affective states and contextual features as latent variables influencing model output quality. The PEF integrates multi-modal user data (e.g., demographics, interaction logs) with linguistic performance to generate adaptive metrics weighted by personalized factors, inspired by co-regulation principles from biology.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect NLP task performance data alongside simulated or real user affective and contextual profiles. 2. Model the interaction between performance and context via latent factor analysis or variational autoencoders. 3. Define personalized metric functions adapting standard benchmarks (e.g., BLEU, accuracy) via learned user-context weights. 4. Validate improved correlation with user satisfaction ratings and replicability across diverse groups.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Text generation outputs from an LLM evaluated by users with different affective profiles (e.g., positive vs negative mood). Expected Output: Personalized evaluation scores reflecting nuanced quality perceptions aligned with user contexts, differing from standard aggregate metrics.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If affective contextualization shows weak correlation, fallback to clustering users into representative groups and apply group-wise adjusted metrics or incorporate additional biosignal proxies (e.g., heart rate variability) to enrich context modeling."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The foundational assumption that personalized affective states and contextual variability significantly alter perceived NLP model quality is plausible but under-explored and could be overly optimistic. The proposal should provide more grounding evidence or preliminary data supporting the scale and consistency of affective influences on evaluation metrics. Otherwise, the framework risks modeling noise or spurious correlations rather than meaningful latent factors. Explicitly clarifying and justifying why psychological and biomedical constructs materially improve evaluation beyond existing aggregate metrics is crucial for soundness, especially given competing literature that often treats such factors as secondary or too subjective for rigorous metrics development. Including a literature synthesis or pilot findings examining affective state impact on user quality perception will strengthen this core assumption in the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections to reduce risk of invalid premise issues or misaligned effort focus. This step is a prerequisite for the complex modeling approach proposed and will improve confidence in downstream method design choices and experiment interpretation.  \n\nIn short, validate and more concretely justify the central assumption that personalization tied to affective neuroscience benefits NLP evaluation metrics substantially to establish soundness at the conceptual level, which currently appears somewhat speculative and under-evidenced in the submission context.  \n\nTarget Sections: Problem_Statement, Proposed_Method."

          "feedback_content": "While the step-by-step experimental plan is logically ordered, it lacks detailed feasibility considerations regarding (a) quality and availability of sufficiently rich multimodal affective/contextual user data, (b) practical challenges in approximate user affect detection especially under real deployment conditions, and (c) validation of personalized metrics against stable ground-truth satisfaction measures. For example, collecting high-quality simultaneous affective signals, demographics, and linguistic output metrics with enough scale and diversity to support latent factor modeling (e.g., VAE) is non-trivial. The plan should explicitly address strategies for obtaining or simulating realistic and representative user contexts with known affective states, and define robust user satisfaction measurement protocols that can validly benchmark personalized metrics. It is also advisable to include contingency approaches or evaluation criteria for cases where affect-based personalization yields marginal or inconclusive results (e.g., neutral or inconsistent impact on correlation improvements). Detailing these aspects will improve the practicality and scientific rigor of the experimentation roadmap and reduce risks of inconclusive outcomes or overly optimistic assumptions about available data and validation processes.  \n\nEnhancing feasibility clarity especially around data collection, annotation, and validation strategies for user affect and contextual modeling is key.  \n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty is labeled NOV-COMPETITIVE and based on affective neuroscience integration with NLP evaluation, incorporating concepts like gaze-based interaction and precision mental health could distinctly elevate novelty and impact. Specifically, integrating gaze-tracking data as an objective, biosignal-based proxy of cognitive and affective user states could substantiate the latent affect variables and enhance personalization robustness beyond self-reports or demographic proxies. This aligns well with the fallback plan's mention of biosignal proxies and could be expanded upfront. Additionally, leveraging precision mental health frameworks can help tailor evaluation metrics not only to transient moods but also to clinically relevant psychological profiles, thus broadening impact to healthcare NLP applicationsâ€”such as conversational agents for mental health support, where personalized evaluation metrics are critical. Incorporating such interdisciplinary, biosignal-based, and clinically grounded user-state data modalities can improve differentiation from existing work, deepen impact across NLP model deployment domains, and demonstrate stronger links to biomedical constructs. This integration should be a clear design objective and may also motivate more diverse and rigorous experimental designs, potentially increasing competitiveness in premier conferences.  \n\nTarget Sections: Proposed_Method, Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan."
