          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines using domain knowledge graphs to prioritize pruning less relevant parameters, aiming to retain core clinical knowledge and explainability. However, the mechanism by which model parameters are systematically mapped and scored against knowledge graph nodes requires clearer elaboration. Specifically, how the integration affects the compression algorithm’s optimization process and how explainability is quantitatively ensured post-compression are unclear. Clarifying this will strengthen confidence in the method's soundness and reproducibility, beyond high-level intuition, e.g., specifying how parameters are linked to clinical entities and how pruning decisions are operationalized respecting model internals and knowledge representation structure is essential. Consider detailing algorithmic steps or pseudo-code illustrating this integration explicitly in the paper to address this gap in mechanism clarity and to mitigate assumptions about the feasibility of such mapping and pruning effectiveness in complex clinical LLMs. This critique targets the Proposed_Method section directly to improve the core scientific grounding of the approach's soundness and clarity of contribution, avoiding ambiguous claims about knowledge-infused compression benefits without clear procedural backing or validation strategy intrinsic to method design stages rather than only in experiments or fallback plans."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is generally well-directed, employing UMLS and BioBERT as a meaningful testbed; however, it lacks concrete details on the evaluation protocols for explainability and how expert evaluation will be standardized or quantified. For a critical domain like clinical NLP, demonstrating explainability requires rigorous metrics or annotation schemes and predefined criteria for expert assessments to avoid subjective bias. Additionally, the plan does not discuss computational resource requirements or timeline feasibility, especially as knowledge-graph guided pruning could introduce nontrivial overhead compared to standard compression methods. Strengthening the experiment plan by specifying precise metrics (e.g., fidelity, plausibility of attention maps), controlled baseline comparisons, number of expert annotators, and sample sizes for clinical text sets would substantiate feasibility. Furthermore, consideration of real-world clinical deployment constraints—such as inference time post-compression and safety evaluation protocols—would ensure the experiments are both scientifically sound and practically feasible with clear success criteria. This addresses the feasibility focus targeting the Experiment_Plan to ensure the approach’s practical and methodological rigour before further development."
