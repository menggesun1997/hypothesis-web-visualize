    "title": "Hierarchical AutoML for Reproducible Fine-Tuning Combining Traditional ML and LLM Pipelines",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing automated optimization lacks hierarchy to coordinate configurations between traditional ML methods and large transformer models for stable fine-tuning replicability.",
    "Motivation": "Expands the external gap of combining traditional and deep ML by proposing hierarchical AutoML that first optimizes traditional pipeline steps before fine-tuning LLM layers, improving reproducibility systematically.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a two-level AutoML framework where the first stage evolves traditional preprocessing and model selection pipelines and the second fine-tunes LLM layers with prompts, sequencing optimizations while considering cross-effects to enhance replicability.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Choose multimodal datasets (text with metadata). 2. Stage-1: Optimize traditional features/classifiers. 3. Stage-2: Fine-tune LLM embeddings and prompts with hyperparameter search. 4. Analyze replicability improvements over monolithic AutoML runs.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Dataset with textual reviews and numeric ratings; Output: Hierarchically optimized pipeline with consistent predictions across runs and improved replicability compared to flat AutoML.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If stage-wise optimization fails, attempt joint optimization with constrained search spaces or use meta-learning to guide pipeline assembly."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks clarity on how the hierarchical two-stage AutoML framework will practically coordinate optimization between traditional ML pipeline components and LLM fine-tuning. The description should explicitly clarify the interaction mechanism and how cross-effects between stages will be modeled and addressed to ensure stable and reproducible convergence, rather than just stating sequencing of optimizations. Adding algorithmic detail or pseudocode outlining this interaction would strengthen the soundness significantly, preventing the framework from appearing as a conceptual sketch rather than a concrete method with well-reasoned mechanics and dependencies between stages. This is critical to elevate beyond existing monolithic or sequential AutoML approaches in this competitive area and to achieve reproducibility guarantees claimed in motivation and problem statement sections. Please revise the Proposed_Method section accordingly with explicit mechanism details and a discussion of potential challenges in coordinating the two-stage hierarchical process reliably and reproducibly, as well as contingency strategies beyond the fallback plan for joint optimization scenarios if cross-effects cause optimization instability or deteriorated performance replicability results in pilots or experiments.  \n\nFurthermore, clarify assumptions about the nature of cross-effects and how these are measurable and optimizable within the hierarchical framework, since this assumption underpins the novelty and impact but is not explicitly justified or tested at a conceptual level currently.  \n\nIn summary, the method section requires a more rigorous exposition of the mechanism to avoid fragility or over-simplicity and to demonstrate that the hierarchical approach can systematically and robustly improve replicability beyond flat AutoML baselines, and how it differs significantly from existing pipeline and neural architecture search methods that may already explore multi-level optimization in some form.  \n\nProviding this will enhance method clarity and soundness for review and future reproducibility by external researchers who implement it, which is currently a weak spot.  \n\nRecommended: Expand the Proposed_Method with algorithmic workflow diagrams, mathematical formalism if applicable, and detailed explanations of the coordination and data flow between traditional ML configuration optimization and LLM fine-tuning steps within the hierarchically structured AutoML framework."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan, while logically ordered, lacks critical details that limit assessment of its feasibility. Specifically:  \n- Dataset choice criteria and preparation steps for multimodal datasets combining text and numeric metadata need elaboration, including expected dataset sizes, domain complexity, and availability to allow reproducibility and benchmarking against existing baselines.  \n- The optimization protocols for Stage-1 and Stage-2 should explicitly specify search algorithms (e.g., evolutionary methods, Bayesian optimization), hyperparameter spaces, evaluation metrics, and reproducibility measurement criteria to concretely operationalize the framework.  \n- The analysis of replicability improvements should include statistical tests or variance metrics over multiple independent runs to quantitatively support claims beyond qualitative observations.  \n- Contingency plans for common practical challenges such as large computational requirements, convergence issues in hierarchical tuning, or domain shift in multimodal data scenarios should be addressed upfront.  \n\nProviding these specifics will make the experiment plan scientifically sound and practically implementable, strengthening confidence in the proposed method's feasibility. It reduces ambiguity on how to perform and validate the hierarchical AutoML pipeline effectively and details exactly how replicability will be measured and demonstrated compared to flat AutoML runs.  \n\nAs the plan stands, it appears high-level and conceptual without sufficient operational rigor, thus undermining feasibility despite a promising research idea. I recommend the authors refine the experiment plan section with explicit, reproducible protocols, metrics, and anticipated experimental conditions to make it actionable and convincing for implementation and review."
