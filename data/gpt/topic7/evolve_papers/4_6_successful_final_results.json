        "title": "Graph-Based Visual Explanation for LLM Decisions in Biomedical Texts",
        "Problem_Statement": "Biomedical large language model (LLM) decisions are often opaque, which limits clinician trust and model adoption, due to lack of interpretable, reliable visual explanations that integrate domain-specific knowledge graphs and faithfully represent model reasoning beyond superficial attention heatmaps.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work has explored attention-based visualizations and knowledge graphs separately, there remains a critical gap in principled, algorithmically grounded methods that integrate LLM attention with biomedical knowledge graphs for domain-aware, clinically meaningful explanations. Our approach advances state-of-the-art by explicitly linking heterogeneous graph structures with LLM internals to generate end-to-end interpretable visualizations, thus empowering clinicians with deeper insight into model decision rationale and facilitating intelligent decision-making in high-stakes settings.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel, multi-stage pipeline that systematically maps normalized LLM attention weights to biomedical knowledge graph nodes and edges using a two-step algorithm: (1) Semantic Alignment—embedding both LLM tokens and biomedical concept nodes into a shared vector space leveraging specialized biomedical language models and graph embeddings (e.g., BioBERT and GraphSAGE), enabling robust mapping of attention distributions to relevant graph elements based on vector similarity and ontology relations; (2) Attention Attribution Refinement—integrating path-based reasoning scores within the graph to adjust initial mappings, mitigating attribution noise and addressing attention interpretability limitations. The resulting mappings form the basis for generating interactive visual explanations that highlight concept relevance and relational structure influencing model predictions. These visualizations are implemented using advanced visualization libraries (e.g., Neo4j Bloom or D3.js) and embedded in a clinician-friendly interface supporting dynamic exploration, filtering by concept type (symptom, drug, disease), and query-driven interaction. This integration embodies end-to-end explainable AI (XAI) for biomedical visual question answering, going beyond raw attention to faithful, principled explanation of LLM decisions.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Dataset Preparation: Use established biomedical QA datasets such as BioASQ and MedQA, paired with curated ontologies (MeSH, UMLS) to construct comprehensive biomedical knowledge graphs. 2) Baselines: Compare our approach with (a) raw attention-based visualizations, (b) gradient-based explanation methods (Integrated Gradients), and (c) state-of-the-art XAI techniques combining LLM outputs with domain ontologies. 3) Explanation Fidelity Evaluation: Quantitatively assess fidelity using metrics such as Infidelity and Sensitivity scores measuring alignment between explanations and model predictions. Additionally, perform simulated perturbation tests by removing top attributed graph nodes to measure drop in prediction confidence. 4) User Study Design: Conduct controlled user studies with at least 30 biomedical domain experts to evaluate trust, interpretability, and clinical utility via validated survey instruments (e.g., System Usability Scale, Trust in Automation questionnaires), and task-based performance metrics on clinical decision-making scenarios. 5) Statistical Analyses: Use appropriate hypothesis testing and effect size measures to compare explanation methods. 6) Ablation Studies: Systematically vary semantic alignment and attribution refinement components to analyze their impact on explanation quality. This comprehensive, multi-faceted experimental framework ensures robustness and practical relevance.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: 'What are the common drugs prescribed for managing rheumatoid arthritis symptoms?' Output: An interactive graph visualization displaying nodes representing rheumatoid arthritis, related symptoms, and drugs such as methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine. Nodes are sized and colored by derived attention attributions reflecting their influence on the LLM answer, with edges indicating relationships from MeSH/UMLS ontologies. Users can click nodes to view underlying evidence snippets or traverse related concepts, providing nuanced, domain-informed explanation beyond raw model attention heatmaps.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the full mapping and visualization pipeline proves overly complex or yields noisy explanations, we will simplify by implementing clustering of graph nodes to reduce visual complexity and focus on top-k most salient concepts as determined by combined semantic and attention scores. Additionally, we will explore leveraging precomputed concept importance from external biomedical knowledge graph embeddings to guide explanations, trading off some real-time fidelity for improved clarity and user interpretability, while preserving core explainability goals."

More detail is needed on the methodology for linking attention weights to graph nodes/edges, and how interactive visualizations will faithfully reflect model reasoning rather than just attention heatmaps, to avoid misleading interpretations. Without a clear, principled mechanism, the soundness of the approach is under question, especially given challenges in attention interpretability in prior work. Consider specifying algorithms or mapping criteria explicitly in the method section to strengthen soundness evidence and guard against superficial or spurious explanations that may hamper user trust rather than improve it.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is promising but underspecified regarding the experimental setup and metrics. For example, explanation fidelity is mentioned but not how it will be quantitatively measured or validated. User trust surveys are proposed but the design, sample size, or domain expert involvement is unclear, which is critical in healthcare contexts. Also, the selection of baseline methods is limited to raw attention visualizations, which may not be a strong enough baseline compared to more advanced XAI techniques. To ensure feasibility, the plan should elaborate on precise evaluation protocols, user study design details, and comparative baselines to convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness and clinical utility of the proposed visualization pipeline."
