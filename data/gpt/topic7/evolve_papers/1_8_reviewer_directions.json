    "title": "Cultural Competence Augmented LLM Training via Cross-Lingual Health Narratives",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs underperform in culturally diverse clinical environments due to insufficient exposure to varied patient narratives and communication styles across languages and cultures, limiting replicability and empathy in real-world settings.",
    "Motivation": "This addresses the internal gap of poor contextual comprehension and empathy by extending LLM training with cross-lingual, multicultural health narratives, directly enhancing model cultural competence and patient-centeredness (Innovation Opportunity 3).",
    "Proposed_Method": "Aggregate a multilingual corpus of health communication texts, patient stories, and clinical dialogues. Use transfer learning and alignment techniques to infuse cultural communication styles into existing LLMs. Develop novel cultural competence metrics evaluating appropriateness, idiomatic expressions, and relational dynamics in model responses. Apply adversarial testing using culturally sensitive queries to validate performance.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Collect and annotate multilingual health communication datasets.\n(2) Align embeddings and fine-tune LLMs on cross-cultural corpora.\n(3) Design evaluation benchmarks for cultural competence.\n(4) Perform comparative analyses with monolingual trained models.\n(5) Conduct focus groups with multicultural clinicians and patients.\n(6) Refine training methods based on feedback.\n(7) Investigate scalability and transferability to new languages.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient query in Spanish expressing concern about mental health stigma.\nExpected Output: LLM response demonstrating culturally sensitive language acknowledging societal factors and promoting supportive resources.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If acquisition of quality multilingual datasets is limited, employ synthetic data augmentation or back-translation techniques. If cultural competence metrics are hard to quantify, use human expert review or proxy indicators such as sentiment alignment."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan outlines a logical sequence, but it lacks specificity and practical detail in crucial areas that challenge feasibility. For example, collecting and annotating multilingual health communication datasets is a complex, resource-intensive task that may face data privacy, access, and standardization issues across cultures and languages. The plan should more explicitly address strategies for dataset acquisition (e.g., partnerships with healthcare institutions, leveraging existing multilingual corpora) and clarify annotation protocols (e.g., annotation schema, annotator qualifications, consistency measures). Additionally, the plan ought to include a clear timeline, resource estimates, and risk mitigation for potential bottlenecks, such as difficulties in obtaining culturally diverse high-quality data or recruiting sufficient expert annotators for cultural competence evaluation. Finally, the adversarial testing methodology and focus group protocols require elaboration to ensure reproducibility and robustness. Enhancing the experimental plan’s operational detail will strengthen confidence in the approach’s practical execution and scientific validity for review and downstream adoption purposes, thereby improving feasibility overall. This critique targets the Proposed_Method and Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan sections, recommending a revision to include concrete data acquisition strategies, annotation methodologies, detailed evaluation designs, and contingency plans for challenges encountered in multilingual, multicultural healthcare contexts."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE and the idea’s reliance on cross-lingual, multicultural health narratives to enhance LLM cultural competence, a promising way to strengthen impact and novelty is to explicitly integrate concepts from 'human-computer interaction', 'social computing', and 'AI explainability' within the Proposed_Method and evaluation framework. For instance, the LLM could be extended not only to produce culturally competent responses but also to explain or justify its cultural reasoning in patient communications, thereby fostering transparency and trust in clinical AI settings. This could be operationalized by designing interactive user studies or HCI evaluations involving clinicians and patients from diverse backgrounds (linking to 'user study' and 'human-computer interaction'), potentially leveraging 'social computing' approaches to capture group-level cultural nuances and feedback. Incorporating these interdisciplinary perspectives would provide a novel combination beyond scaling multilingual health narratives, and substantiate the impact through improved user acceptance, explanation capabilities, and ethical AI deployment in multicultural healthcare environments. This suggestion targets the Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan to explicitly incorporate global concepts for deeper impact and novelty."
