          "feedback_content": "The proposed method lacks sufficient clarity on how the harm-risk predictive models influence the compression process concretely. It is unclear how parameters contributing positively to risk scores will be identified and pruned without degrading essential clinical reasoning capabilities. More detailed algorithmic descriptions or theoretical justifications would strengthen the methodological soundness and ensure safety-critical knowledge is effectively preserved during compression, rather than inadvertently removed or weakened, which could exacerbate harm risks instead of mitigating them. Consider specifying the exact integration mechanism of risk predictions into pruning decisions and how safety constraints are enforced throughout compression iterations to make the method fully reproducible and robust to clinical settings with high stakes outputs, such as by incorporating formal guarantees or ablation studies on critical parameters retention versus risk indicators in early experiments within the plan sections targeted at feasibility assessment yet missing here from the method specification itself. This clarity is pivotal given the ethical sensitivity and risk management goals underlying the project, ensuring the solutionâ€™s rationale sufficiently addresses the core technical challenges posed by loss of semantics in compressed clinical LLMs with ethical risk-aware mechanisms as motivation states initially."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The experimental plan, while outlining appropriate datasets, baselines, and metrics, needs further elaboration on procedures ensuring validity and generalizability. It does not detail how harm incidence will be quantitatively defined and measured post-compression, nor whether potential confounders such as dataset imbalance or shifts in clinical task distributions will be accounted for. Moreover, it should specify how annotation quality and coverage of ethical risk labels in adverse event datasets will be ensured or augmented given their critical role in training the harm-risk predictors. Explicitly include validation protocols for harm predictor reliability, specify evaluation on out-of-distribution clinical prompts to test robustness, and define thresholds or statistical standards for acceptable trade-offs between compression ratio, accuracy, and harm reduction. The fallback plan involving human-in-the-loop validation is promising but depends heavily on experimental infrastructure setup and cost feasibility; this also requires more concrete procedural description. Adding these details will enhance the experimental design's rigor, feasibility, and reproducibility in clinical NLP research contexts with high real-world impact and safety demands."
