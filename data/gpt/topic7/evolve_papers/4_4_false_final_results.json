    "title": "Domain-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning with Interactive Expert Feedback Loops",
    "Problem_Statement": "Domain adaptation using reinforcement learning in LLMs suffers from sparse expert supervision, leading to errors and potentially harmful outputs in sensitive fields like healthcare.",
    "Motivation": "Bridges the gap of insufficient expert supervision by incorporating continuous interactive expert feedback into RL fine-tuning, improving model safety and replicability across domains.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement a reinforcement learning framework where domain experts provide real-time corrective feedback via a visualization interface during model prediction tasks, guiding the reward shaping and policy updates for safer outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Datasets of clinical question-answering with domain experts participating in live annotation sessions. Baselines: standard instruction fine-tuning RL. Metrics: safety score, error rate, user satisfaction.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical query with ambiguous term. Output: Model proposes answer, expert corrects via interface, model updates policy and provides improved, safer answer.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time feedback is impractical, develop batch feedback mechanisms combined with simulated user corrections or automated expert heuristics for reward redefinition."
