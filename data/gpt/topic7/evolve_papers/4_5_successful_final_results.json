        "title": "Cross-Modal Anomaly Detection with Temporal-Aligned Vision-Language Fusion and Federated Learning for Robust Healthcare Monitoring",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing anomaly detection systems in critical care environments often operate unimodally, analyzing either clinical texts or visual patient monitoring independently. This limits detection sensitivity, timely intervention, and interpretability, especially in complex ICU settings with asynchronous, noisy, and heterogenous data streams like clinical notes, continuous video feeds, and physiological signals. Current methods lack principled approaches to fuse temporally misaligned multimodal data in real time while addressing privacy and deployment constraints.",
        "Motivation": "While multimodal fusion approaches integrating clinical notes and visual data have shown promise, they often overlook critical challenges such as asynchronous temporal alignment, noise robustness, interpretability, and clinical workflow integration. Our proposal advances the field by developing a novel temporally aligned multi-headed attention fusion architecture augmented with large language model (LLM)-based semantic embeddings and vision-language pretraining. Coupled with federated learning for privacy-preserving deployment and integration of eye-tracking data from smart glasses to enhance patient state understanding, this system addresses key gaps in reliable, trustworthy anomaly detection. This method significantly differs from prior work by explicitly handling temporal asynchrony, heterogeneity, and real-time constraints to provide actionable, interpretable alerts that blend AI-based visual reasoning with narrative clinical context, pioneering intelligent decision-making in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) era.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-stage deep learning architecture combining: (1) Extraction of contextual embeddings from clinical notes using fine-tuned LLMs trained on medical corpora; (2) Visual feature extraction from ICU video streams employing a spatiotemporal convolutional backbone enhanced with eye-tracking data captured via smart glasses to model patient attention and clinician gaze patterns; (3) Temporal alignment using dynamic time warping and cross-correlation to synchronize asynchronous modalities; (4) A multi-headed attention fusion module that incorporates modality-specific noise modeling and uncertainty estimation for robust weighting; (5) Integration of RF sensing data (where available) to complement visual monitoring; (6) Deployment of federated learning to enable cross-hospital model training while preserving patient data privacy; (7) Post-fusion anomaly detection via an end-to-end classifier with built-in interpretability techniques (e.g., attention visualization, counterfactual generation) allowing clinicians to understand alert rationale. Ablation studies will systematically evaluate each fusion component's contribution, including individual modality input, noise handling, and temporal alignment, to ensure interpretability and clinical deployment trustworthiness.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Data Collection: Acquire or establish partnerships for a multicenter ICU dataset including synchronized, time-stamped clinical notes, continuous video monitoring (with eye-tracking via smart glasses worn by clinicians), and annotated RF sensing data where feasible. Ensure compliance with privacy laws via federated learning setup. 2. Annotation Strategy: Collaborate with clinical experts to develop an annotation protocol labeling anomalies by cross-modal contextual inconsistency and clinical relevance, using consensus scoring to handle ICU environment complexity. 3. Baselines: Implement unimodal anomaly detection baselines including video-only CNN+LSTM models, clinical-note-only LLM classifiers, vision-language models, and existing state-of-the-art multimodal fusion frameworks without temporal alignment or federated learning. 4. Experiments: Train and evaluate models on cross-modal anomaly detection task, conducting ablation studies for temporal alignment, fusion modules, noise modeling, and modality contributions. 5. Evaluation Metrics: Measure detection accuracy, false positive rate, anomaly detection timeliness, alert interpretability using human-in-the-loop evaluations, and clinical workflow impact assessed via simulated clinician feedback. 6. Computational Analysis: Benchmark latency and resource consumption on medical-grade edge hardware to confirm real-time feasibility. 7. Fallback Implementation: Define switch criteria based on validation performance degradation or latency breaches, triggering fallback to separate unimodal detectors with decision-level fusion and alert prioritization. Evaluate fallback strategy impact on detection robustness and clinical usability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1: Input - Clinical notes indicate stable vitals over last hour, but video captures repetitive, subtle patient limb tremors identified via deep visual features combined with clinician gaze fixation patterns from smart glasses. Output - Early anomaly alert generated by fused model highlighting cross-modal discordance and visual attention cues, with attention maps explaining feature influences. Example 2: Input - Clinical notes mention recent medication change; video shows patient restlessness. Cross-modal fusion detects temporal misalignment but corroborates anomaly presence. Output - Alert with interpretability report assisting clinician decision-making about possible adverse drug effects. Example 3: Input - Asynchronous noisy clinical notes with misspellings and incomplete sentences; visual feed suffers occlusion. Fusion model uses noise-aware embeddings and uncertainty estimation to reduce false positives, only triggering high-confidence alerts to minimize alarm fatigue.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time temporal alignment or fusion module performance degrades (e.g., due to data quality issues or computational constraints), the system will revert to a robust two-stage approach: separate unimodal anomaly detectors running independently on clinical text and video streams, followed by a lightweight decision-level fusion module aggregating outputs based on confidence thresholds and historical correlations. This fallback will be evaluated through dedicated tests, with clearly defined trigger criteria monitored continuously during deployment. Additionally, if federated learning proves infeasible, centralized training on anonymized datasets with differential privacy mechanisms will be employed to balance data utility and confidentiality. Performance and clinical impact of fallback strategies will be benchmarked alongside the full system to ensure practical robustness and trustworthiness in diverse clinical environments."

More detailed methodological descriptions or preliminary feasibility insights would strengthen the soundness of the approach and help assess its practical viability and robustness in complex clinical environments where noise and variability are high. Clarify these mechanism-level details to build confidence in the core approach's validity and reproducibility, especially considering healthcare data complexity and heterogeneity in clinical notes and video feeds like ICU patient monitoring environments. Suggesting ablation studies on fusion components would also enhance clarity on the contribution of each modality's input to anomaly detection performance and interpretability in medical decision contexts, crucial for deployment trustworthiness and clinical impact assessment. This is essential given the sensitive healthcare setting and the challenge of producing actionable alerts without overwhelming clinicians with false positives or irrelevant alarms, which the brief metric description only partially addresses (accuracy and false positives). Provide a more rigorous exposition to confirm the soundness of the proposed mechanism in the healthcare monitoring context described in your Problem Statement and Proposed_Method sections. Target explicitly multi-modal fusion challenges such as asynchronous data, noise, clinical language variance, and realtime constraints for comprehensive confidence in the approach's soundness and scientific contribution significance in this interdisciplinary domain context."
