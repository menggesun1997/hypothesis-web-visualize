    "title": "Neural Decoding-Inspired Interpretability for LLM Prompt Engineering",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM prompt engineering lacks interpretability tools that explain how latent representations correspond to output behavior, limiting replicability and controllability.",
    "Motivation": "Fills both internal and external gaps by applying neural decoding methods from brain-computer interfaces to elucidate the information flows in LLM latent states during prompt processing, enhancing replicability through transparent design.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a neural decoding-based module that maps LLM hidden states elicited by prompts to predicted output attributes (e.g., sentiment, topic). By interpreting these latent codes, the model guides prompt design to achieve desired outputs reliably. It combines dimensionality reduction, representational similarity analysis, and supervised decoding heads trained on annotated latent-output pairs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Choose large pre-trained LLMs (e.g., GPT-3, BERT) and prompts with varied semantics. 2. Extract hidden states during prompt processing. 3. Collect output annotations (topics, sentiments). 4. Train decoding models to reconstruct these attributes from latent states. 5. Use insights to modify prompts systematically. 6. Evaluate replicability improvements and interpretability via human evaluation and reproducibility metrics.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A prompt designed for positive sentiment generation; Decoding reveals latent activations strongly associated with positivity dimensions; Expected modification: refined prompt reinforcing these activations leading to consistent positive outputs across runs and paraphrases.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If decoding accuracy is low, incorporate novel representation learning or contrastive methods to improve latent disentanglement. Alternatively, use synthetic datasets with controlled semantics for clearer mapping and re-evaluate generalizability."

          "feedback_content": "While the proposed method of using neural decoding with dimensionality reduction and representational similarity analysis is promising, the explanation lacks clarity on how these techniques will concretely enable interpretable mapping from latent states to output attributes to guide prompt engineering. The pipeline requires a more detailed mechanism clarifying how latent decoding insights translate into actionable prompt modifications and how these modifications are systematically derived and validated, in order to ensure the interpretability claim is substantiated and operationalizable beyond correlational analysis. Consider illustrating the feedback loop from decoding to prompt refinement with algorithmic steps or examples that concretely connect latent representations to prompt design decisions and outcomes, ensuring the interpretability benefit is convincingly grounded in the method’s structure and outputs. This elaboration is vital to confirm the soundness of the method’s interpretability and utility within prompt engineering tasks.  The current description leaves a gap that could undermine replicability and practical relevance if unaddressed.  Target Section: Proposed_Method.  This nuance is critical given the complex, opaque nature of LLM hidden states and the ambition to render prompt engineering transparent and controllable via neural decoding techniques, a novel cross-domain adaptation—explicit bridging steps are needed to support this transition robustly and convincingly."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is a solid starting point but does not sufficiently address potential practical challenges and risks that could impede feasibility at scale or in realistic settings. For example, the plan lacks detail on how to handle variability in decoding accuracy across diverse prompts or LLM architectures, how to ensure annotations are sufficiently rich and scalable for training decoding heads, and how human evaluators will systematically assess interpretability improvements with objective and reliable metrics. Furthermore, it omits discussion on how to evaluate the generalizability of decoding-guided prompt refinements beyond the initial test cases or datasets, especially on unseen prompts or domains. Inclusion of quantitative success criteria, scalability considerations, and contingency strategies beyond the fallback plan—for example, methods for prompt-space exploration, cross-validation of decoding models, or ablation studies—would considerably strengthen the feasibility assessment. Strengthening the experiment plan to more explicitly capture these dimensions would make the approach more convincing and practically actionable. Target Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan."
