    "title": "Automated Hybrid Pipeline Optimization for LLM Fine-Tuning Combining Traditional ML and Deep CNN Approaches",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing AutoML tools for LLMs do not integrate traditional machine learning algorithms and CNN techniques, missing replicability enhancement through hybrid architectures and pipeline optimization.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the external gap linking traditional ML and CNN methods with modern LLM workflows by expanding automated hyperparameter and architecture search tools like TPOT to hybrid pipelines, boosting reproducibility and performance.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an AutoML extension that generates composite LLM fine-tuning pipelines blending deep transformers, CNN-based context encoders, and traditional classifiers/preprocessing. The search space includes model selection, feature extraction methods, prompting strategies, and optimization algorithms. Optimization criteria center on replicability across datasets and tasks.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Use text classification datasets with varying domain complexity (e.g., Reuters, IMDB). 2. Define pipeline components: LLM embeddings, CNN encoding layers, traditional classifiers (SVM, Random Forest). 3. Incorporate prompt augmentation modules. 4. Extend TPOT genetic programming search to these components and their hyperparameters. 5. Baseline against pure LLM fine-tuning and prompt engineering. 6. Measure replicability as consistency of outputs over repeated training and evaluation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: News article classification task; Optimized pipeline includes BERT embeddings feeding a CNN encoder followed by an SVM classifier with prompt-based feature infusion; Output: stable classification results with low variance and high F1 score across experiments.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If search space is too large for convergence, apply hierarchical optimization starting with components independently. Reduce pipeline complexity or incorporate pruning of less effective branches during evolution."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method combines distinct model types—deep transformers, CNN encoders, and traditional classifiers—within a single AutoML pipeline. However, the mechanism lacks clarity on how these heterogeneous components will be effectively integrated and optimized cohesively. For example, the interplay between CNN-based context encoding and transformer embeddings, as well as how prompt augmentation modules feed into or interact with downstream classifiers, is not well-articulated. This ambiguity risks making the evolutionary search inefficient or ineffective without a principled design or constraints on pipeline construction. Clarify the architectural design choices and interaction mechanisms between these components to demonstrate a coherent, well-reasoned integration strategy rather than a loose combination of parts. Include how the pipeline search will ensure meaningful feature flow and parameter compatibility across diverse model types instead of just expanding search space blindly.  This will strengthen the soundness of the method and increase feasibility for optimization convergence and reproducibility goals in hybrid pipelines."

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment, to enhance impact and novelty, consider integrating concepts from globally linked areas such as 'neural architecture search' and 'automatic data augmentation' within the hybrid pipeline optimization framework. For example, incorporating automated data augmentation techniques tailored for textual data or multimodal inputs could boost robustness and generalization. Further, you could explore reinforcement learning-based or black-box optimization methods beyond genetic programming to optimize pipeline structure and hyperparameters more efficiently. Additionally, extending the approach towards diverse application domains like 'medical image analysis' or 'code generation' where hybrid CNN-transformer architectures have shown promise can broaden impact and demonstrate versatility. These incorporations can elevate the work from a combinational novelty towards an innovative AutoML framework pushing frontiers in representational and application diversity, thus addressing high competition areas with more distinct contributions."
