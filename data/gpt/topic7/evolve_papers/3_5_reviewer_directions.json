    "title": "Bi-Directional Fairness Feedback Loop Between Sign Language Recognition and LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Despite identified cross-disciplinary opportunities, sign language recognition insights have not been integrated into fairness-aware LLM designs, missing potential bias mitigation strategies in multimodal models.",
    "Motivation": "This idea exploits the external gap of integrating sign language recognition research—rich in fairness and accessibility considerations—into LLM fairness frameworks, a novel cross-pollination opportunity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Propose a bi-directional feedback framework where fairness constraints and bias metrics derived from sign language datasets inform LLM multimodal training, while LLM semantic fairness embeddings improve sign language recognition fairness. Develop joint training objectives that enforce fairness consistency across text and sign recognition modalities, enhancing accessibility and reducing modality-specific biases.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect paired sign language and textual datasets annotated for demographic attributes. 2) Train joint multimodal LLMs and sign recognition models with shared fairness objectives. 3) Evaluate fairness stability and bias reduction across modalities. 4) Compare with unimodal baselines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multimodal query including sign language video and text with potential biased content. Expected output: Fair, unbiased responses consistent across both modalities.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If joint training is challenging, start with transferring fairness embeddings downstream from sign recognition to LLMs, or vice versa."
