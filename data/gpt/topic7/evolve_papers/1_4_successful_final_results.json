    "title": "Behavioral Science-Informed LLM Response Personalization Module",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs frequently deliver uniform, non-personalized responses lacking consideration of individual patient behavioral drivers or communication preferences, limiting clinical utility and patient engagement.",
    "Motivation": "This idea targets the external gap in integrating health communication and behavioral science with LLM training (Critical Gap), advancing Innovation Opportunity 3 by customizing responses that respect patient psychological and cultural contexts for improved adoption.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a personalization module that conditions LLM outputs on behavioral profiles derived via brief patient interaction inputs or EHR meta-data, embedding behavioral change theories and communication style adaptations. The system dynamically modifies tone, detail level, and motivational framing, generating responses optimized for adherence and understanding.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Annotate clinical dialogues with behavioral profile categories (e.g., stages of change, health literacy).\n(2) Train LLMs with conditional generation architecture integrating behavioral inputs.\n(3) Conduct controlled trials with simulated patient scenarios.\n(4) Evaluate personalization effectiveness via comprehension, engagement, and likelihood of behavior change metrics.\n(5) Compare to non-personalized LLM outputs.\n(6) Collect feedback from behavioral scientists and clinicians.\n(7) Iterate model refinements based on findings.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient profile indicating low health literacy and high anxiety.\nQuery: \"How do I manage my diabetes?\"\nExpected Output: Simple, empathetic, actionable advice acknowledging patient concerns, avoiding jargon, and motivating small achievable steps.",

        "title": "Adaptive Multi-Domain Behavioral Science-Informed LLM Response Personalization System",
        "Problem_Statement": "Large Language Models (LLMs) typically generate standardized responses that inadequately reflect individual patients' behavioral drivers, communication preferences, or psychological states. This lack of nuanced personalization limits clinical effectiveness, patient engagement, and behavior change across diverse health domains.",
        "Motivation": "While personalization in LLMs has been explored, existing approaches often rely on static behavioral inputs without adaptive learning, limiting novelty and generalizability. Addressing the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating, this work innovates by integrating behavioral science with reinforcement learning—specifically multi-armed bandit frameworks—and semantic differential self-report scales to create a continuously learning, adaptive personalization module. This system is designed for multiple clinical domains including diabetes management, tobacco control, and mental health, enhancing cross-disease transferability. By combining rigorous behavioral annotation procedures with dynamic optimization, our approach transcends prior static conditioning methods, offering a more effective, patient-tailored clinical NLP solution.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel LLM response personalization system that (1) derives detailed behavioral profiles through validated semantic differential scales combined with expert-curated behavioral annotations of clinical dialogues, (2) employs a multi-armed bandit reinforcement learning algorithm that dynamically explores and exploits optimal communication styles and motivational framings during patient interactions, and (3) assimilates multi-domain clinical contexts such as diabetes, tobacco cessation, and mental health to enable transfer learning. Behavioral inputs will be captured via brief patient self-reports and electronic health record (EHR) meta-data where available. The system continuously updates LLM response strategies based on patient engagement and outcome proxy feedback metrics. This closed-loop design allows for personalized, adaptive messaging that evolves with patient responses and supports scalable implementation across clinical use cases, advancing innovation by linking behavioral science rigor with state-of-the-art adaptive machine learning for clinical NLP.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Convene panels of behavioral science and clinical communication experts to define and operationalize behavioral profile categories; develop clear annotation guidelines.\n2) Conduct iterative pilot annotation rounds on diverse clinical dialogue datasets to achieve high inter-rater reliability (e.g., Cohen's kappa > 0.8), refining annotation schema.\n3) Integrate validated semantic differential scales into patient self-report instruments administered pre-dialogue for nuanced behavioral input capture.\n4) Develop algorithms to extract and harmonize behavioral profiles from combined patient self-reports and EHR meta-data, validating extraction accuracy through manual review.\n5) Implement the multi-armed bandit-based personalization module that iteratively tests and refines response adaptations in simulated and real patient interaction settings.\n6) Design and execute controlled clinical simulation trials with sufficiently powered, demographically diverse patient cohorts—target sample size estimated via power analysis to detect statistically significant improvements in behavioral proxies and clinical outcomes.\n7) Measure personalization effectiveness through multi-dimensional metrics: patient comprehension, engagement, validated behavioral outcomes (e.g., readiness to change, adherence proxies), and clinical indicators relevant to each health domain.\n8) Collect qualitative feedback from behavioral scientists, clinicians, and patients to inform iterative system refinements.\n9) Perform comprehensive statistical analyses including causal inference methods to establish efficacy beyond engagement metrics alone.\n10) Document and publish protocols, datasets, and code to ensure replicability and facilitate broader adoption.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example 1:\nInput: Patient profile with low health literacy, high anxiety (via semantic differential scales), and EHR notes indicating early-stage diabetes.\nQuery: \"How do I manage my diabetes?\"\nExpected Output: Empathetic, jargon-free explanation emphasizing simple, actionable steps and motivational framing tailored to anxiety reduction and cognitive load minimization.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: Patient profile indicating moderate tobacco dependence and ambivalence toward quitting (captured through self-report scales).\nQuery: \"Should I consider quitting smoking now?\"\nExpected Output: Personalized message balancing motivational interviewing techniques with factual benefits tailored to patient's readiness to change, dynamically adjusted through bandit learning based on prior engagement feedback.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: Mental health patient profile showing variable mood states and cognitive openness.\nQuery: \"How can I handle my anxiety episodes?\"\nExpected Output: Responses adapting tone and cognitive reframing approaches that have empirically yielded higher engagement and improved self-reported coping in prior interactions within the reinforcement learning framework.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If behavioral profile extraction accuracy is suboptimal despite validation efforts, fallback strategies include transitioning to coarser patient segmentation based on stable demographic or clinical features and incorporating manual clinician input to guide personalization. Should the adaptive multi-armed bandit framework fail to demonstrate improvements in engagement or behavioral proxies, alternative reinforcement learning methods such as contextual bandits or offline policy evaluation will be explored. If multi-domain transfer learning introduces complexity limiting initial performance, domain-specific models may be developed as interim solutions with enhanced cross-domain fine-tuning strategies planned for subsequent iterations."

          "feedback_content": "While the step-by-step experiment plan is systematic, it risks oversimplifying the complexity of behavioral profile annotation and its integration with LLMs. Annotating clinical dialogues with behavioral categories such as stages of change or health literacy requires expert consensus and substantial inter-rater reliability assessment, which is not detailed. Moreover, the plan lacks specificity on how to reliably extract or infer behavioral profiles from brief patient inputs or EHR meta-data, which is critical for personalization validity and repeatability. The controlled trial phase should also explicitly describe patient diversity, sample size, and statistical power considerations to ensure generalizable results. Incorporating iterative annotation and pilot testing phases prior to full model training would strengthen feasibility and reduce downstream risks. Please augment the experiment plan with detailed methodology for behavioral profile extraction, annotation validation, and rigorous trial design with clear success criteria for personalization effectiveness evaluation, beyond engagement metrics alone to include clinical or behavioral outcome proxies where possible. This addresses feasibility by anchoring the ambitious personalization in rigorous, replicable experimental steps that account for domain complexities and variability in real-world clinical communication contexts.

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the rich context of linked concepts, integrating multi-armed bandit algorithms could significantly enhance personalization adaptivity and novelty. Specifically, the system could dynamically learn optimal communication styles or motivational framings for different behavioral profiles through online bandit-based exploration-exploitation methods during simulated or real patient interactions. This would allow the LLM response personalization module not only to condition on static behavioral inputs but also to continually optimize messaging strategies based on patient engagement and outcome feedback. Furthermore, embedding semantic differential scales into patient profiling could offer nuanced, quantifiable behavioral attributes guiding fine-grained adaptation. As for impact, applying this module beyond diabetes education to other domains like tobacco control or mental health practice can demonstrate broader utility and facilitate cross-disease transfer learning. Recasting the idea as a continuously learning, multi-domain behavioral personalization system using reinforcement learning principles would elevate originality and practical value, positioning it competitively at the intersection of behavioral science, adaptive machine learning, and clinical NLP.
