    "title": "Cross-Dataset Transfer Learning for Stable LLM Fine-Tuning Using Brain-Inspired Bottleneck Layers",
    "Problem_Statement": "Fine-tuning LLMs on one dataset often fails to replicate well on others due to overfitting and unstable internal representations, particularly without bottleneck mechanisms for generalization.",
    "Motivation": "Combines insights from transfer learning and brain-computer interfaces to incorporate neural-inspired information bottlenecks that stabilize representations across datasets, mitigating internal replicability gaps externally noted in cross-domain generalization.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design fine-tuning protocols embedding compressed latent bottleneck layers inspired by neural decoding theories that encourage generalizable, compact representations. This layer acts as a regularizer during multi-dataset fine-tuning to enhance replicability and transfer.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select diverse datasets (e.g., news, medical texts). 2. Fine-tune LLMs with and without bottleneck layers. 3. Evaluate zero-shot or few-shot transfer to held-out datasets. 4. Measure replicability across independent training runs.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Fine-tuning GPT-2 on news dataset with bottleneck layer; Output: Consistent performance on medical dataset prediction tasks versus unstable baselines.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If bottleneck layers degrade performance, experiment with different bottleneck sizes or apply multi-task learning techniques to encourage feature reuse while preserving stability."
