        "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Public Health-AI Model Drift Analyzer with Clinical Decision Support Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "There is a critical need for systematic and pragmatic evaluation methods to detect and mitigate performance drift in Transformer-based LLMs deployed within dynamic clinical environments. Such environments integrate rapidly evolving epidemiological data, socio-technical workflows, and clinical decision processes. Current approaches insufficiently address challenges in real-time data integration, privacy, and linkage between LLM outputs, public health variables, and clinician workflows, undermining safety and reliability in healthcare applications, especially during infectious disease outbreaks and high-impact public health events.",
        "Motivation": "This project advances the hybrid approach by explicitly bridging clinical decision support systems and real-time Transformer-based LLM monitoring with epidemiological inputs from CDC datasets and evidence gap mapping techniques. It addresses both internal deployment variance evaluation and external public health risk prioritization under dynamic workflows, thereby enabling targeted drift detection aligned with high-impact clinical and pre-hospital care scenarios. By focusing on seamless data integration and actionable feedback loops, it enhances AI safety monitoring and translational utility in healthcare, responding directly to complexity and integration deficits in current model drift evaluation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular, scalable pipeline integrating continuous monitoring of Transformer-based LLM outputs within clinical decision support (CDS) workflows. Key components include: (1) real-time collection and anonymized linkage of LLM clinical query responses with aggregated clinician interaction metadata and workflow system logs, ensuring privacy and standardization; (2) integration of public health variables and epidemiological risk factors from CDC datasets enriched by evidence gap mapping to prioritize drift alerts for critical clinical domains such as infectious disease control and pre-hospital emergencies; (3) deployment of advanced statistical and machine learning drift detection algorithms (e.g., population stability index, KL divergence) tuned for multimodal data streams; (4) implementation of adaptive feedback loops where detected drifts dynamically trigger adjustments within the CDS, enhancing decision accuracy and workflow responsiveness; and (5) inclusion of systematic review methods for ongoing validation and refinement of drift impact assessments. The architecture supports heterogeneous data harmonization via standardized preprocessing pipelines and secure data-sharing agreements with clinical partners, facilitating robust linkage without compromising privacy.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Establish data-sharing agreements ensuring anonymized and aggregated clinician workflow metadata availability from partner clinical institutions; leverage HL7 FHIR standards for metadata integration. (2) Collect and preprocess longitudinal LLM outputs from production clinical CDS environments alongside timestamped, aggregated clinician interaction logs and workflow metadata. (3) Ingest synchronized public health datasets and real-time epidemiological variables, incorporating evidence gap mapping to highlight critical domains. (4) Develop and deploy drift detection algorithms optimized for multimodal, anonymized data; validate statistical thresholds iteratively. (5) Correlate drift detection results with epidemiological risk trends and clinician feedback collected via structured surveys and system logs. (6) Implement a CDS feedback loop prototype where drift alerts modify or flag clinical decision outputs dynamically. (7) Evaluate system performance through controlled deployment within a high-impact infectious disease use case, analyzing detection timeliness, decision support improvement, and workflow integration efficacy. (8) As fallback, supplement sparse workflow data with privacy-preserving aggregated proxies, including electronic health record event summaries and de-identified audit trails to maintain analytical validity without individual-level data dependency.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input Stream: Real-time LLM-generated clinical summaries and recommendations on infectious disease queries combined with anonymized, aggregated clinician interaction logs and timestamped updates from CDC epidemiological surveillance. Expected Output: Early and prioritized detection of model drift corresponding to changes in clinical guidance or epidemiological risk status, triggering dynamic alerts and recalibration signals within the CDS workflow. This includes detection of divergence when LLM recommendations conflict with updated CDC guidelines or when clinician correction rates spike, enabling rapid clinical response and adaptation in both hospital and pre-hospital care settings.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "In scenarios with limited clinician workflow metadata availability, utilize aggregated, anonymized proxy datasets such as EHR event frequency summaries, CDS system audit logs, and de-identified timestamped decision overrides to approximate workflow variance. Refine drift detection algorithms to incorporate these proxies and augment thresholds accordingly. If noise persists in drift signals, employ ensemble approaches leveraging external epidemiological indicators and evidence gap maps to contextualize alerts, reducing false positives. Additionally, implement simulated interface logs based on historical interaction patterns adjusted with epidemiological risk profiles to sustain prototype evaluation without compromising patient privacy or analytic rigor."

Obtaining real-time clinician workflow metadata and accurately linking it with LLM outputs and public health data in production clinical environments can be highly challenging due to privacy, heterogeneity, and operational constraints. To improve feasibility, the proposal should clarify strategies for data collection agreements, preprocessing standardization, and system integration architecture. Additionally, clear fallback methodologies beyond simulation (e.g., anonymized or aggregated proxy data sources) should be elaborated to mitigate sparse clinician workflow data scenarios effectively without compromising validity of drift analysis results. This will strengthen confidence that the experimental validation is practical and scientifically rigorous given clinical deployment complexities, which is essential for successful demonstration and adoption of the analyzer toolchain in real-world settings.
