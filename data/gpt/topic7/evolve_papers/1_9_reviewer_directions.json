    "title": "Human-AI Collaboration Modeling for Bias Mitigation in Clinical LLM Outputs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Biases inherent in LLM outputs pose clinical risks, and existing human-in-the-loop assessments do not systematically model or mitigate how clinician interactions influence bias propagation during decision-making.",
    "Motivation": "This project targets internal gaps in bias mitigation by modeling human-AI collaboration paths and identifying intervention points to reduce harmful bias, using socio-technical insights about online labor market sampling and interaction workflows (Critical Gap + Innovation Opportunity 2).",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a computational framework simulating clinician review behaviors, anchoring biases in LLM suggestions, and correction workflows. Introduce bias detection algorithms coupled with dynamic query refinement mechanisms involving human feedback at critical junctures. Evaluate the framework on synthetic and real clinical scenarios for bias attenuation effectiveness.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Collect datasets illustrating common clinical LLM biases.\n(2) Model clinician interaction workflows and correction patterns.\n(3) Implement bias detection and refinement modules.\n(4) Simulate collaborative sessions with varying human correction intensities.\n(5) Measure bias reduction and decision accuracy improvements.\n(6) Test framework robustness in real or simulated clinical environments.\n(7) Propose best-practice guidelines for human-AI bias mitigation synergy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM output exhibits gender bias in treatment recommendation.\nExpected Output: Simulation shows how clinician overrides correct bias and system adapts future suggestions accordingly, reducing repeated bias occurrence.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If simulated workflow models lack fidelity, collect real interaction data for improved modeling. If bias detection algorithms yield false positives, tune thresholds or incorporate domain expert signals."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines a computational framework simulating clinician behaviors combined with bias detection and query refinement modules. However, the specific mechanisms of how clinician interactions are modeled and integrated with bias detection algorithms remain vague. Clarify how the simulation captures the diversity and complexity of real clinician correction workflows and how dynamic query refinements adapt concretely based on human feedback. This detailed exposition will strengthen the scientific grounding and reproducibility of the approach, addressing a key gap in mechanistic clarity identified at this stage of the review. Consider including formal models or algorithmic descriptions for the correction and adaptation processes proposed to enhance understanding and validity of the methodology.\n\n(Target section: Proposed_Method)"

However, feasibility concerns arise from potential difficulties in obtaining high-fidelity clinician interaction data and real clinical bias benchmarks, which are critical for model calibration and validation. To ensure practical progress, strengthen fallback plans by specifying alternative data sources, such as collaborations with clinical institutions (e.g., University Clinics of Kinshasa), or leveraging publicly available medical dialogue corpora. Additionally, clarify evaluation metrics and threshold criteria for 'bias reduction' and 'decision accuracy improvements' to enable scientifically sound and reproducible experimentation.\n\n(Target section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan)"

Expanding the scope through targeted use cases from such underexplored but high-impact areas will enhance novelty and societal relevance. Moreover, collaborating with institutions like University Clinics of Kinshasa can provide unique datasets and validation environments, enriching the evaluation and adoption pathways. Embedding these globally linked concepts would not only broaden impact but may position the work distinctively within clinical NLP and AI fairness communities.\n\n(Target section: Test_Case_Examples and Experiment_Plan)"
