        "title": "Hierarchical AutoML Framework with Cross-Stage Coordination for Reproducible Fine-Tuning of Traditional ML Pipelines and Large Language Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current AutoML approaches predominantly perform monolithic or sequential optimizations which inadequately model and coordinate the complex cross-effects between traditional machine learning pipeline components and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning. This lack of holistic, hierarchical coordination leads to unstable convergence and limited replicability when combining traditional ML techniques with LLMs, hindering stable, reproducible fine-tuning across multimodal datasets.",
        "Motivation": "While existing AutoML and neural architecture search methods have explored multi-level optimization, they often neglect the intrinsic and measurable cross-dependencies between traditional ML preprocessing/modeling steps and the subsequent LLM fine-tuning process within heterogeneous pipelines. Our hierarchical approach introduces a rigorously coordinated two-stage optimization framework emphasizing explicit interaction mechanisms between stages, grounded in measurable cross-effects. This enables systematic, reproducible convergence and improved fine-tuning stability, distinguishing our method by integrating multi-objective hyperparameter optimization and evolutionary strategies tailored for the complex interplay in hybrid AI pipelines, thereby advancing reproducibility guarantees and state-of-the-art performance beyond competitive baselines.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a Hierarchical AutoML framework composed of two tightly integrated stages with explicit cross-stage coordination:  \n\n1. **Stage-1: Traditional ML Pipeline Optimization** \n- Optimizes preprocessing steps (e.g., feature scaling, encoding, selection) and traditional classifiers (e.g., gradient boosting, SVM) using multi-objective evolutionary optimization (inspired by the Firefly Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization) balancing predictive accuracy and pipeline stability.\n- Outputs an optimized traditional ML pipeline configuration along with quantitative cross-effect sensitivity metrics measuring feature and model stability impacts on downstream LLM inputs.\n\n2. **Stage-2: LLM Fine-Tuning with Prompt and Embedding Optimization** \n- Takes outputs and sensitivity data from Stage-1 to condition the LLM fine-tuning hyperparameter search (learning rates, prompt templates, embedding structure) using Bayesian optimization constrained by Stage-1 stability metrics.\n- Employs a deep Q-learning framework to adaptively schedule fine-tuning iterations based on performance and replicability feedback.\n\n**Cross-Stage Coordination Mechanism:**\n- The framework formalizes cross-effects as measurable perturbation metrics capturing how variability in Stage-1 configurations influences Stage-2 fine-tuning stability and prediction variance.\n- These metrics inform a joint objective function for constrained hierarchical optimization, with explicit coordination via feedback loops adjusting Stage-1 search priors based on Stage-2 fine-tuning replicability.\n- Algorithmic Workflow (pseudocode):\n\n```\nInitialize population of traditional ML pipelines (P1)\nfor generation in Stage-1 optimization:\n    Evaluate pipelines optimizing accuracy and stability objectives\n    Compute cross-effect sensitivities on downstream LLM inputs\n    Update population using Firefly/PSO strategies\nSelect top-K pipelines and corresponding stability metrics\nfor each pipeline in top-K:\n    Condition LLM fine-tuning hyperparameter search\n    Use Bayesian optimization and deep Q-learning to fine-tune\n    Measure replicability (variance over multiple runs)\nIf replicability below threshold:\n    Feedback cross-effect gradients to adjust Stage-1 search space\nRepeat until convergence or max iterations\n```\n\nThis hierarchical method explicitly models and optimizes cross-dependencies, distinguishing it from flat or loosely sequential AutoML pipelines and existing neural architecture searches. We will release an open-source Python library implementing this framework for reproducible research. Potential challenges include computational cost and stability of feedback loops, tackled via adaptive search space pruning and meta-learning-based warm starts.\n\n",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. **Dataset Selection and Preparation:**\n- Select at least two publicly available multimodal datasets combining text and numeric metadata, e.g., Amazon product reviews with textual reviews and numeric ratings (~100k samples) and a biomedical image classification dataset with associated patient metadata.\n- Preprocess datasets following documented reproducible protocols, ensuring balanced class distribution and standardized splits.\n\n2. **Stage-1 Optimization Protocol:**\n- Implement multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (Firefly Algorithm + Particle Swarm Optimization hybrid) to optimize preprocessing choices (e.g., normalization methods, feature selectors) and traditional classifiers (e.g., random forests, SVM), with hyperparameter spaces clearly defined (e.g., number of trees: 10–500, SVM kernel types).\n- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, F1-score, and pipeline stability quantified by variance of traditional model outputs over multiple random seeds (e.g., 10 runs).\n\n3. **Stage-2 Optimization Protocol:**\n- Conditioned on Stage-1 top pipelines, optimize LLM fine-tuning using Bayesian optimization over learning rate (1e-6 to 1e-3), prompt template variants, and embedding layer sizes.\n- Utilize deep Q-learning to adaptively control fine-tuning schedule iterations.\n- Evaluation metrics include fine-tuning accuracy, loss convergence, and replicability measured by variance of predictions over 15 independent fine-tuning runs.\n\n4. **Replication and Analysis:**\n- Conduct at least 30 independent full hierarchical AutoML runs; as control, perform 30 flat AutoML runs combining all parameters monolithically.\n- Statistical tests (e.g., paired t-tests, Levene’s test for variance) will assess replicability improvements and performance gains.\n- Report detailed ablation studies isolating cross-effects influence.\n\n5. **Computational and Practical Considerations:**\n- Use scalable cloud-based GPU clusters; apply early stopping and adaptive pruning to manage compute.\n- Address potential domain shifts in multimodal data through data augmentation and domain adaptation techniques.\n\n6. **Contingency Plans:**\n- If hierarchical coordination leads to instability, implement meta-learning warm-starts and constraint relaxation protocols within feedback loops.\n- Explore joint optimization with reduced hyperparameter spaces as fallback, validating impact.\n\nThis detailed, reproducible protocol ensures both feasibility and rigorous validation of our hierarchical framework.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "- **Input:** Multimodal dataset consisting of 50,000 product reviews with textual comments and numerical ratings.\n- **Output:**\n  - Stage-1 optimized pipeline selecting TF-IDF with specific tokenization and a LightGBM classifier yielding repeatable accuracy (e.g., ±0.5% variance over seeds).\n  - Stage-2 LLM fine-tuning on transformer embeddings and prompt templates resulting in stabilized downstream performance with replicability variance below established thresholds (e.g., prediction variance < 1%).\n\n- Compare flat AutoML baseline (joint tuning of all parameters) exhibiting higher prediction variance (e.g., >5%) and less consistent convergence.\n\n- Demonstrate cross-effect metrics correlating Stage-1 variability with Stage-2 fine-tuning stability.\n\n- Additional cases include biomedical data classification combining imaging-derived features with patient metadata to verify generalizability.\n\n- Performance improvements measured quantitatively with multi-objective optimization metrics, statistical significance tests, and computational resource usage contrasted to baselines.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If our hierarchical coordination encounters unmanageable optimization instability or replicability degradation in pilot experiments:  \n\n1. Transition to a constrained joint optimization approach limiting hyperparameter search spaces via domain heuristics to reduce complexity and interaction effects.\n\n2. Apply meta-learning to warm-start pipeline configurations based on similar dataset characteristics, reducing exploration demands.\n\n3. Incorporate surrogate modeling to approximate cross-stage interactions, smoothing feedback signals and enhancing stability.\n\n4. Evaluate simpler two-stage pipelines without tight feedback loops as ablated baselines to benchmark trade-offs.\n\n5. Explore incremental hierarchical tuning, tuning Stage-1 first on subsets of data, followed by progressive integration with Stage-2.\n\nThese adjustments aim to preserve the core hierarchical insight while enhancing practical stability and reproducibility, maintaining fidelity to the original novelty contribution even under challenging conditions."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks clarity on how the hierarchical two-stage AutoML framework will practically coordinate optimization between traditional ML pipeline components and LLM fine-tuning. The description should explicitly clarify the interaction mechanism and how cross-effects between stages will be modeled and addressed to ensure stable and reproducible convergence, rather than just stating sequencing of optimizations. Adding algorithmic detail or pseudocode outlining this interaction would strengthen the soundness significantly, preventing the framework from appearing as a conceptual sketch rather than a concrete method with well-reasoned mechanics and dependencies between stages. This is critical to elevate beyond existing monolithic or sequential AutoML approaches in this competitive area and to achieve reproducibility guarantees claimed in motivation and problem statement sections. Please revise the Proposed_Method section accordingly with explicit mechanism details and a discussion of potential challenges in coordinating the two-stage hierarchical process reliably and reproducibly, as well as contingency strategies beyond the fallback plan for joint optimization scenarios if cross-effects cause optimization instability or deteriorated performance replicability results in pilots or experiments.  \n\nFurthermore, clarify assumptions about the nature of cross-effects and how these are measurable and optimizable within the hierarchical framework, since this assumption underpins the novelty and impact but is not explicitly justified or tested at a conceptual level currently.  \n\nIn summary, the method section requires a more rigorous exposition of the mechanism to avoid fragility or over-simplicity and to demonstrate that the hierarchical approach can systematically and robustly improve replicability beyond flat AutoML baselines, and how it differs significantly from existing pipeline and neural architecture search methods that may already explore multi-level optimization in some form.  \n\nProviding this will enhance method clarity and soundness for review and future reproducibility by external researchers who implement it, which is currently a weak spot.  \n\nRecommended: Expand the Proposed_Method with algorithmic workflow diagrams, mathematical formalism if applicable, and detailed explanations of the coordination and data flow between traditional ML configuration optimization and LLM fine-tuning steps within the hierarchically structured AutoML framework."

Specifically:  \n- Dataset choice criteria and preparation steps for multimodal datasets combining text and numeric metadata need elaboration, including expected dataset sizes, domain complexity, and availability to allow reproducibility and benchmarking against existing baselines.  \n- The optimization protocols for Stage-1 and Stage-2 should explicitly specify search algorithms (e.g., evolutionary methods, Bayesian optimization), hyperparameter spaces, evaluation metrics, and reproducibility measurement criteria to concretely operationalize the framework.  \n- The analysis of replicability improvements should include statistical tests or variance metrics over multiple independent runs to quantitatively support claims beyond qualitative observations.  \n- Contingency plans for common practical challenges such as large computational requirements, convergence issues in hierarchical tuning, or domain shift in multimodal data scenarios should be addressed upfront.  \n\nProviding these specifics will make the experiment plan scientifically sound and practically implementable, strengthening confidence in the proposed method's feasibility. It reduces ambiguity on how to perform and validate the hierarchical AutoML pipeline effectively and details exactly how replicability will be measured and demonstrated compared to flat AutoML runs.  \n\nAs the plan stands, it appears high-level and conceptual without sufficient operational rigor, thus undermining feasibility despite a promising research idea.
