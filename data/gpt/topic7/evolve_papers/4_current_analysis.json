We used Likert scale analysis and inductive free-text categorization to assess the quality of the simplified reports.ResultsMost radiologists agreed that the simplified reports were factually correct, complete, and not potentially harmful to the patient. Nevertheless, instances of incorrect statements, missed relevant medical information, and potentially harmful passages were reported.ConclusionWhile we see a need for further adaption to the medical field, the initial insights of this study indicate a tremendous potential in using LLMs like ChatGPT to improve patient-centered care in radiology and other medical domains.Clinical relevance statementPatients have started to use ChatGPT to simplify and explain their medical reports, which is expected to affect patient-doctor interaction. This phenomenon raises several opportunities and challenges for clinical routine.Key Points• Patients have started to use ChatGPT to simplify their medical reports, but their quality was unknown.• In a questionnaire, most participating radiologists overall asserted good quality to radiology reports simplified with ChatGPT. However, they also highlighted a notable presence of errors, potentially leading patients to draw harmful conclusions.• Large language models such as ChatGPT have vast potential to enhance patient-centered care in radiology and other medical domains. To realize this potential while minimizing harm, they need supervision by medical experts and adaption to the medical field.Graphical Abstract'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'BioBERT: a pre-trained biomedical language representation model for biomedical text mining', 'abstract': 'MOTIVATION: Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important as the number of biomedical documents rapidly grows. With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora.\\nRESULTS: We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24% MRR improvement). Our analysis results show that pre-training BERT on biomedical corpora helps it to understand complex biomedical texts.\\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We make the pre-trained weights of BioBERT freely available at https://github.com/naver/biobert-pretrained, and the source code for fine-tuning BioBERT available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': '2010 i2b2/VA challenge on concepts, assertions, and relations in clinical text', 'abstract': 'The 2010 i2b2/VA Workshop on Natural Language Processing Challenges for Clinical Records presented three tasks: a concept extraction task focused on the extraction of medical concepts from patient reports; an assertion classification task focused on assigning assertion types for medical problem concepts; and a relation classification task focused on assigning relation types that hold between medical problems, tests, and treatments. i2b2 and the VA provided an annotated reference standard corpus for the three tasks. Using this reference standard, 22 systems were developed for concept extraction, 21 for assertion classification, and 16 for relation classification. These systems showed that machine learning approaches could be augmented with rule-based systems to determine concepts, assertions, and relations. Depending on the task, the rule-based systems can either provide input for machine learning or post-process the output of machine learning. Ensembles of classifiers, information from unlabeled data, and external knowledge sources can help when the training data are inadequate.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'BioCreative V CDR task corpus: a resource for chemical disease relation extraction', 'abstract': 'Community-run, formal evaluations and manually annotated text corpora are critically important for advancing biomedical text-mining research. Recently in BioCreative V, a new challenge was organized for the tasks of disease named entity recognition (DNER) and chemical-induced disease (CID) relation extraction. Given the nature of both tasks, a test collection is required to contain both disease/chemical annotations and relation annotations in the same set of articles. Despite previous efforts in biomedical corpus construction, none was found to be sufficient for the task. Thus, we developed our own corpus called BC5CDR during the challenge by inviting a team of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) indexers for disease/chemical entity annotation and Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) curators for CID relation annotation. To ensure high annotation quality and productivity, detailed annotation guidelines and automatic annotation tools were provided. The resulting BC5CDR corpus consists of 1500 PubMed articles with 4409 annotated chemicals, 5818 diseases and 3116 chemical-disease interactions. Each entity annotation includes both the mention text spans and normalized concept identifiers, using MeSH as the controlled vocabulary. To ensure accuracy, the entities were first captured independently by two annotators followed by a consensus annotation: The average inter-annotator agreement (IAA) scores were 87.49% and 96.05% for the disease and chemicals, respectively, in the test set according to the Jaccard similarity coefficient. Our corpus was successfully used for the BioCreative V challenge tasks and should serve as a valuable resource for the text-mining research community.Database URL: http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-v/track-3-cdr/.

    "title": "Optimizing Computational Efficiency for Replicable LLM Performance Across Domains: Landscape Map",
    "current_research_landscape": "The current research landscape in optimizing computational efficiency for replicable performance of large language models (LLMs) across domains centers heavily on advanced natural language processing (NLP) methods tailored for specialized biomedical and clinical text mining tasks. The dominant methodology is the development and fine-tuning of domain-specific pre-trained language representation models, such as BioBERT, which leverage large-scale biomedical corpora to address word distribution shifts from general domain corpora to specialized domains. This focus on model specialization stems from earlier findings on the limitations of general-purpose LLMs when applied directly to domain-specific tasks, as observed in the biomedical field and medical report simplification. Reinforcement learning and instruction fine-tuning also play key roles in enhancing adaptability and performance across applications. Central to this progress is the integration of machine learning with curated expert knowledge bases and annotated corpora, as well as efforts in responsibly addressing ethical concerns and model efficiency (e.g., Green AI). The core consensus involves balancing state-of-the-art accuracy with practical considerations of domain adaptation, computational cost, and ethical implications, leveraging domain corpora and expert-labeled datasets to yield replicable and interpretable models for specialized NLP applications.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internally, significant limitations persist in model generalization and computational efficiency. Despite advances such as BioBERT, these models still exhibit errors, incompleteness, or potentially harmful outputs when deployed in sensitive domains like healthcare, highlighting the need for tighter domain adaptation and expert supervision. Moreover, the pervasive reliance on massive, computationally expensive pre-training regimes raises concerns about environmental impact and inclusivity, as noted by critiques surrounding 'Stochastic Parrots' and the advocacy for Green AI. There is also an underexplored challenge in fully understanding the internal mechanics and overparameterization of these large models, limiting interpretability and efficient compression methods. Externally, the global context analysis reveals a lack of integration between sophisticated language representation models and advanced data visualization or interaction paradigms (e.g., word-cloud representations linked with graphical interpretability). Cross-disciplinary applications in mental health assessment, real-time anomaly detection, and complex question-answering frameworks using spatial and visual reasoning remain underutilized, representing a missed opportunity to enhance LLM robustness and interpretability through multimodal and contextual clues.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "1. Development of Hybrid Domain-Adaptive NLP Frameworks Incorporating Interactive Visualization: Leverage the identified gap linking language representation models and word-cloud/graphical representations to create domain-specific NLP systems with interactive visualization tools. This would enhance interpretability, user trust, and error correction in sensitive domains such as medicine.  \n\n2. Research on Computationally Efficient, Explainable, and Ethical LLM Architectures: Inspired by the Green AI paradigm and concerns over model size and risks, pursue novel lightweight architectures and compression strategies informed by deeper BERTology insights. Emphasize explainability to prevent harmful outputs in clinical contexts, ensuring replicability with lower environmental cost.\n\n3. Cross-Modal and Context-Aware LLMs for Real-Time and Complex Domain Tasks: Integrate advanced language models with visual, spatial, and real-time anomaly detection techniques, targeting applications like mental health assessment and complex question answering. This bridges the gap between NLP and data science/multimedia domains to broaden applicability and improve domain generalization without exponential computational burdens."
