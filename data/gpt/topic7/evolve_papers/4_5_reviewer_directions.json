    "title": "Cross-Modal Anomaly Detection with LLM-Augmented Visual Reasoning in Healthcare Monitoring",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current anomaly detection tools lack integration of textual clinical notes with visual monitoring data, limiting sensitivity and real-time detection in healthcare settings.",
    "Motivation": "Exploits the external gap of unutilized cross-modal data fusion for anomaly detection, pioneering a system combining LLMs and visual reasoning to detect complex anomalies across modalities efficiently.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Build a system where textual clinical notes are parsed by LLMs to generate contextual embeddings, which are fused with features from continuous visual monitoring (e.g., patient movement) via a multi-headed attention module for anomaly detection.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Dataset: synchronized clinical notes and video feeds from ICU patients. Baselines: unimodal anomaly detectors. Metrics: detection accuracy, false positive rate, computational cost.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Clinical note indicating stable status and video showing unusual patient movement. Output: Anomaly alert triggered by cross-modal inconsistency flagged by model.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If fusion degrades detection, explore sequential anomaly scanning or implement separate detectors with decision-level fusion."

          "feedback_content": "While the integration of LLM-generated embeddings from clinical notes with visual monitoring features via a multi-headed attention module is promising, the proposal lacks clarity on key technical specifics: how temporal alignment between asynchronous modalities will be handled, details on the architecture of the fusion module, and justification for chosen embedding representations. More detailed methodological descriptions or preliminary feasibility insights would strengthen the soundness of the approach and help assess its practical viability and robustness in complex clinical environments where noise and variability are high. Clarify these mechanism-level details to build confidence in the core approach's validity and reproducibility, especially considering healthcare data complexity and heterogeneity in clinical notes and video feeds like ICU patient monitoring environments. Suggesting ablation studies on fusion components would also enhance clarity on the contribution of each modality's input to anomaly detection performance and interpretability in medical decision contexts, crucial for deployment trustworthiness and clinical impact assessment. This is essential given the sensitive healthcare setting and the challenge of producing actionable alerts without overwhelming clinicians with false positives or irrelevant alarms, which the brief metric description only partially addresses (accuracy and false positives). Provide a more rigorous exposition to confirm the soundness of the proposed mechanism in the healthcare monitoring context described in your Problem Statement and Proposed_Method sections. Target explicitly multi-modal fusion challenges such as asynchronous data, noise, clinical language variance, and realtime constraints for comprehensive confidence in the approach's soundness and scientific contribution significance in this interdisciplinary domain context."

Finally, clarify the fallback plan implementation specifics and evaluation criteria, explaining how and when you will decide to switch strategies, reflecting a robust experimental contingency design important for practical feasibility. Addressing these points will make your experimental validation plan more scientifically rigorous, credible, and feasible for healthcare anomaly detection scenarios."
