    "title": "Hybrid Human-AI Annotation Ecosystem for Scalable LLM Assessment",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM evaluation lacks scalable, high-fidelity human annotation that balances domain expertise and diverse socio-technical insights, limiting the generalizability and reliability of model assessments under diverse, real-world clinical conditions.",
    "Motivation": "This tackles the external gap regarding the underutilization of online labor markets combined with domain expert inputs (Critical Gap) and leverages Innovation Opportunity 2 to create a socio-technical hybrid evaluation system exploiting Mechanical Turk and clinical expertise synergistically.",
    "Proposed_Method": "We design a hybrid annotation platform combining scalable online crowdworkers for initial evaluations with iterative expert clinician validations. Crowdworkers receive context-sensitive training modules to improve healthcare query annotation quality, while experts resolve complex cases and calibrate annotations. Consensus algorithms weigh crowd and expert labels to produce robust LLM output quality scores, thus enabling broader yet reliable replicability assessments.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Develop training materials for crowdworkers about clinical query nuances.\n(2) Assemble a pool of crowdworkers and healthcare experts.\n(3) Collect LLM outputs on a variety of clinical and biomedical queries.\n(4) Assign outputs initially to crowdworkers for coarse annotation.\n(5) Experts review flagged and ambiguous annotations.\n(6) Calculate quality metrics and inter-rater reliability.\n(7) Compare pure expert evaluation vs. hybrid system impact on assessment speed and fidelity.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM answer to \"What are the symptoms of early-stage Parkinson's disease?\"\nExpected Output: Crowdworkers correctly identify inaccuracies in symptom descriptions, while experts validate borderline cases with detailed feedback.\nConsensus produces a reliable quality score that reflects nuanced model flaws.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If crowdworker annotations are low quality, improve training or restrict to vetted workers. If expert time is a bottleneck, use active learning to minimize expert review load or explore AI-based quality prediction models."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes crowdworkers can achieve reliable annotations on nuanced clinical data after limited training, which is a strong and critical assumption. To strengthen soundness, provide evidence or prior work references demonstrating that non-expert crowdworkers, even with training, can properly interpret healthcare queries and flag subtle inaccuracies before expert review. Without this validation, the foundational assumption may not hold, threatening the method’s effectiveness and overall reliability of the hybrid system outputs. Clarify how differences in crowdworker background and training efficacy will be measured and managed, potentially through pilot studies or calibration tasks prior to the main experiments to ensure annotation quality at scale is feasible and valid in this domain context. This will make the problem statement and proposed mechanism more convincing and grounded in empirical data rather than optimistic assumptions alone, thus improving the core soundness of the work.  The proposed consensus approach relies heavily on trustworthy initial crowd annotations which must be convincingly justified to avoid cascading errors or miscalibration downstream in expert validation phases or consensus algorithms’ quality scoring stages. This also includes addressing potential biases or knowledge gaps typical in general crowdworker pools with respect to clinical expertise needed for nuanced judgment calls in biomedical query evaluation. Overall, strengthening the empirical or theoretical justification behind this assumption is essential for soundness and feasibility of the approach upfront, as it drives the method design and experimental plan validity directly. This critique targets the problem statement and proposed method sections where assumptions about annotation quality and hybrid validation workflows are laid out without sufficient validation, which is key for a top-tier review assessment to push for rigor and robustness in this important, high-stakes evaluation context. Please address this early and explicitly to build a more defensible foundation for the hybrid annotation system’s premise and scalability claims, aligning better with realistic worker capabilities and clinical complexity constraints of the domain. "

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan outlines a reasonable workflow but lacks detailed operationalization and mitigation strategies for key feasibility risks, particularly regarding (1) how crowdworker training effectiveness will be assessed and adapted iteratively; (2) the criterion and process for flagging ambiguous annotations requiring expert review; and (3) quantitative goals or thresholds defining success for speed gains versus fidelity losses compared to pure-expert annotation baselines. To strengthen feasibility, provide more detailed experimental design elements such as sample sizes, annotation task interface design considerations, quality control measures, and specifics on consensus algorithm calibration including ablation or sensitivity analyses. Additionally, steps to handle potential engagement issues or expertise variation in crowdworkers and experts should be more concretely elaborated, possibly integrating active learning or adaptive sampling methods explicitly in the plan rather than only in the fallback. The plan focuses on clinical and biomedical queries but should clarify the diversity and representativeness of these queries to ensure robust conclusions about generalizability. Overall, the plan as stated is somewhat high-level and would benefit from added experimental rigor detail, associated metrics, concrete decision rules, and contingency protocols to convincingly demonstrate that proposed methods can be reliably and efficiently implemented at scale, which is critical for acceptance in premier venues and impactful real-world deployment. Addressing these to solidify operational feasibility will strengthen the paper substantially and better align expectations around results and resource requirements with the project's ambitious goals."
