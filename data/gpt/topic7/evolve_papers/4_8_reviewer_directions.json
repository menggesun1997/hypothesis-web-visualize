          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines combining masked language modeling and masked region modeling with joint embedding alignment, but lacks detailed explanation of how the unified pretraining objective will effectively align these disparate modalities in the medical context. Clarify the architecture design, loss functions, and mechanism for handling modality-specific nuances and potential conflicts to ensure the approach is well-grounded and reproducible. Without this, the soundness of the approach remains uncertain and risks underexplaining key technical challenges inherent to multimodal medical data integration and representation learning techniques, which differ significantly from general domain vision-language models due to domain-specific complexities like the necessity for clinical accuracy and subtle visual cues in medical images. Enhance this section with concrete model details and rationale for design choices to strengthen confidence in the technical feasibility and correctness of the method proposed in the biomedical domain context, especially considering the masked region modeling on medical images and how its embedding aligns robustly with linguistic embeddings from free-text reports within electronic health records (EHR). This ensures the research has solid foundational mechanisms supporting the ambitious goal stated in the Problem_Statement and Motivation sections."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty assessment and the highly active research in multimodal biomedical ML, consider integrating domain-specific knowledge bases or ontologies (e.g., UMLS or radiology lexicons) into the pretraining pipeline via fusion or contrastive learning to enhance semantic understanding beyond raw data alignment. Also, leverage transformer-based architectures known from state-of-the-art vision-language pretraining, and explore federated learning paradigms to address privacy and data-access limitations common in healthcare. Incorporating a downstream task such as medical visual question answering (Med-VQA) or intelligent decision-making modules that use fused multimodal embeddings can broaden impact and demonstrate applicability to complex health-related tasks, thus differentiating the work from existing literature. This can increase the idea's novelty, practical relevance, and appeal to the ACL/NeurIPS research community and clinical stakeholders."
