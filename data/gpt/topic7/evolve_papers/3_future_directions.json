        "title": "Adaptive Interactive Fairness Dashboard for LLM Deployment",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM deployments lack interactive systems that enable real-time user-driven fairness supervision, resulting in persistent biases and instabilities during live use.",
        "Motivation": "This idea directly addresses the internal gap of minimal user supervision and the under-explored area of embedding human-computer interaction to enable continuous bias correction during LLM operation. It leverages the 'minimal user supervision' bridge in the landscape.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an Adaptive Interactive Fairness Dashboard (AIFD) integrating advanced visualization, explainability modules (XAI), and real-time user feedback mechanisms. The system allows users to identify bias patterns in LLM outputs, provide corrective annotations, and propagate adjustments to fine-tune the model deployment dynamically. It includes a feedback loop where the LLM adapts its biases based on supervised annotations with minimal user effort, using active learning protocols.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Utilize benchmark datasets with known bias attributes (e.g., bias in gender/names) and deploy an LLM (like GPT-based) in a controlled environment. 2) Develop the AIFD interface with modules for bias detection visualization and user annotation. 3) Implement active learning to update the model on user feedback. 4) Baseline without user interaction vs. system with AIFD enabled. 5) Evaluate fairness metrics (e.g., Equality of Opportunity, demographic parity) and output stability over deployment cycles.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A generated text with gender stereotypes about job roles. Expected output: The dashboard highlights biased phrases, user flags them, and the model adjusts to generate unbiased alternatives in subsequent outputs.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time adaptation proves unstable, fallback to batch-mode corrections aggregated from user feedback before model updates. Employ simulated user feedback to augment sparse supervision data."

        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a multimodal fairness framework that layers semantic fairness constraints inspired by hierarchical taxonomies combined with domain-specific ontologies (e.g., biomedical ontologies, environmental datasets). The framework will impose bias stability metrics and fairness regularization terms aligned with domain ethics within the LLM training and fine-tuning process. Semantic embeddings reflect multi-domain fairness priorities, enabling cross-modal stable behavior.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate multimodal datasets combining text/image data with biomedical and environmental context labels. 2) Develop semantic fairness constraint modules by integrating WordNet/ImageNet hierarchies with biomedical ontologies and mapping those to LLM embeddings. 3) Train a multimodal LLM with fairness-aware loss functions enforcing bias stability. 4) Evaluate on bias and fairness benchmarks specific to healthcare and environmental monitoring, measuring bias drift over replicable deployments.",

        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an Explainability-Guided Bias Drift Detection system that applies modular XAI interpretability tools (e.g., feature attribution, neuron importance) combined with robust generalization metrics to monitor bias shifts in deployed LLMs. Introduce control mechanisms that trigger bias mitigation routines when drift exceeds thresholds. Employ concepts from protein folding stability to analyze and maintain 'bias folding' states for model fairness consistency during re-deployment cycles.",

Uses active learning to select most informative samples for supervision. Employs feedback loops that adjust model behavior based on certified annotations. Integrates automated explainability feedback to guide annotators' attention.",
