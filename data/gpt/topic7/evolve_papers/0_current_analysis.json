Artificial intelligence (AI) is commonly used to facilitate the early detection of disease, understand disease progression, and discover new treatments in the fields of both physical and mental health. The present review provides a broad overview of AI methodology and its applications in data acquisition and processing, feature extraction and characterization, psychiatric disorder classification, potential biomarker detection, real-time monitoring, and interventions in psychiatric disorders. We also comprehensively summarize AI applications with regard to the early warning, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of specific psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, addiction, sleep disorders, and Alzheimer's disease. The advantages and disadvantages of AI in psychiatry are clarified. We foresee a new wave of research opportunities to facilitate and improve AI technology and its long-term implications in psychiatry during and after the COVID-19 era.\"}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Insomnia', 'abstract': 'Insomnia is highly prevalent in clinical practice, occurring in up to 50% of primary care patients. Insomnia can present independently or alongside other medical conditions or mental health disorders and is a risk factor for the development and exacerbation of these other disorders if not treated. In 2016, the American College of Physicians recommended that insomnia be specifically targeted for treatment. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia, whether the underlying cause has been identified or not, is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Currently, there is no global consensus regarding which pharmacological treatment has the best efficacy or risk-benefit ratio. Both CBT-I and pharmacological intervention are thought to have similar acute effects, but only CBT-I has shown durable long-term effects after treatment discontinuation. Administering a combined treatment of CBT-I and medication could decrease the latency to treatment response, but might diminish the durability of the positive treatment effects of CBT-I.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Performance of seven consumer sleep-tracking devices compared with polysomnography', 'abstract': 'STUDY OBJECTIVES: Consumer sleep-tracking devices are widely used and becoming more technologically advanced, creating strong interest from researchers and clinicians for their possible use as alternatives to standard actigraphy. We, therefore, tested the performance of many of the latest consumer sleep-tracking devices, alongside actigraphy, versus the gold-standard sleep assessment technique, polysomnography (PSG).\\nMETHODS: In total, 34 healthy young adults (22 women; 28.1 ± 3.9 years, mean ± SD) were tested on three consecutive nights (including a disrupted sleep condition) in a sleep laboratory with PSG, along with actigraphy (Philips Respironics Actiwatch 2) and a subset of consumer sleep-tracking devices. Altogether, four wearable (Fatigue Science Readiband, Fitbit Alta HR, Garmin Fenix 5S, Garmin Vivosmart 3) and three nonwearable (EarlySense Live, ResMed S+, SleepScore Max) devices were tested. Sleep/wake summary and epoch-by-epoch agreement measures were compared with PSG.\\nRESULTS: Most devices (Fatigue Science Readiband, Fitbit Alta HR, EarlySense Live, ResMed S+, SleepScore Max) performed as well as or better than actigraphy on sleep/wake performance measures, while the Garmin devices performed worse. Overall, epoch-by-epoch sensitivity was high (all ≥0.93), specificity was low-to-medium (0.18-0.54), sleep stage comparisons were mixed, and devices tended to perform worse on nights with poorer/disrupted sleep.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Consumer sleep-tracking devices exhibited high performance in detecting sleep, and most performed equivalent to (or better than) actigraphy in detecting wake. Device sleep stage assessments were inconsistent. Findings indicate that many newer sleep-tracking devices demonstrate promising performance for tracking sleep and wake. Devices should be tested in different populations and settings to further examine their wider validity and utility.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Measuring agreement in method comparison studies', 'abstract': 'Agreement between two methods of clinical measurement can be quantified using the differences between observations made using the two methods on the same subjects. The 95% limits of agreement, estimated by mean difference +/- 1.96 standard deviation of the differences, provide an interval within which 95% of differences between measurements by the two methods are expected to lie. We describe how graphical methods can be used to investigate the assumptions of the method and we also give confidence intervals. We extend the basic approach to data where there is a relationship between difference and magnitude, both with a simple logarithmic transformation approach and a new, more general, regression approach. We discuss the importance of the repeatability of each method separately and compare an estimate of this to the limits of agreement. We extend the limits of agreement approach to data with repeated measurements, proposing new estimates for equal numbers of replicates by each method on each subject, for unequal numbers of replicates, and for replicated data collected in pairs, where the underlying value of the quantity being measured is changing. Finally, we describe a nonparametric approach to comparing methods.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Wearable Sleep Technology in Clinical and Research Settings', 'abstract': \": The accurate assessment of sleep is critical to better understand and evaluate its role in health and disease. The boom in wearable technology is part of the digital health revolution and is producing many novel, highly sophisticated and relatively inexpensive consumer devices collecting data from multiple sensors and claiming to extract information about users' behaviors, including sleep. These devices are now able to capture different biosignals for determining, for example, HR and its variability, skin conductance, and temperature, in addition to activity. They perform 24/7, generating overwhelmingly large data sets (big data), with the potential of offering an unprecedented window on users' health. Unfortunately, little guidance exists within and outside the scientific sleep community for their use, leading to confusion and controversy about their validity and application. The current state-of-the-art review aims to highlight use, validation and utility of consumer wearable sleep-trackers in clinical practice and research. Guidelines for a standardized assessment of device performance is deemed necessary, and several critical factors (proprietary algorithms, device malfunction, firmware updates) need to be considered before using these devices in clinical and sleep research protocols. Ultimately, wearable sleep technology holds promise for advancing understanding of sleep health; however, a careful path forward needs to be navigated, understanding the benefits and pitfalls of this technology as applied in sleep research and clinical sleep medicine.\"}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia: A meta-analysis of long-term effects in controlled studies', 'abstract': 'Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a treatment with moderate to large effects.

A smaller subset of experts formed a committee and reviewed the compiled diaries. Items deemed essential were included in a Core sleep diary, and those deemed optional were retained for an expanded diary. Secondly, optional items would be available in other versions. A draft of the Core and optional versions along with a feedback questionnaire were sent to members of the Pittsburgh Assessment Conference. The feedback from the group was integrated and the diary drafts were subjected to 6 focus groups composed of good sleepers, people with insomnia, and people with sleep apnea. The data were summarized into themes and changes to the drafts were made in response to the focus groups. The resultant draft was evaluated by another focus group and subjected to lexile analyses. The lexile analyses suggested that the Core diary instructions are at a sixth-grade reading level and the Core diary was written at a third-grade reading level.\\nCONCLUSIONS: The Consensus Sleep Diary was the result of collaborations with insomnia experts and potential users. The adoption of a standard sleep diary for insomnia will facilitate comparisons across studies and advance the field. The proposed diary is intended as a living document which still needs to be tested, refined, and validated.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'European guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia', 'abstract': 'This European guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia was developed by a task force of the European Sleep Research Society, with the aim of providing clinical recommendations for the management of adult patients with insomnia. The guideline is based on a systematic review of relevant meta-analyses published till June 2016. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians involved in the management of insomnia, and the target patient population includes adults with chronic insomnia disorder. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system was used to grade the evidence and guide recommendations. The diagnostic procedure for insomnia, and its co-morbidities, should include a clinical interview consisting of a sleep history (sleep habits, sleep environment, work schedules, circadian factors), the use of sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, questions about somatic and mental health, a physical examination and additional measures if indicated (i.e. blood tests, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram; strong recommendation, moderate- to high-quality evidence). Polysomnography can be used to evaluate other sleep disorders if suspected (i.e. periodic limb movement disorder, sleep-related breathing disorders), in treatment-resistant insomnia, for professional at-risk populations and when substantial sleep state misperception is suspected (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults of any age (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). A pharmacological intervention can be offered if cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia is not sufficiently effective or not available. Benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine receptor agonists and some antidepressants are effective in the short-term treatment of insomnia (≤4\\xa0weeks; weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Antihistamines, antipsychotics, melatonin and phytotherapeutics are not recommended for insomnia treatment (strong to weak recommendations, low- to very-low-quality evidence). Light therapy and exercise need to be further evaluated to judge their usefulness in the treatment of insomnia (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Complementary and alternative treatments (e.g. homeopathy, acupuncture) are not recommended for insomnia treatment (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'From promise to practice: towards the realisation of AI-informed mental health care', 'abstract': 'In this Series paper, we explore the promises and challenges of artificial intelligence (AI)-based precision medicine tools in mental health care from clinical, ethical, and regulatory perspectives. The real-world implementation of these tools is increasingly considered the prime solution for key issues in mental health, such as delayed, inaccurate, and inefficient care delivery. Similarly, machine-learning-based empirical strategies are becoming commonplace in psychiatric research because of their potential to adequately deconstruct the biopsychosocial complexity of mental health disorders, and hence to improve nosology of prognostic and preventive paradigms. However, the implementation steps needed to translate these promises into practice are currently hampered by multiple interacting challenges. These obstructions range from the current technology-distant state of clinical practice, over the lack of valid real-world databases required to feed data-intensive AI algorithms, to model development and validation considerations being disconnected from the core principles of clinical utility and ethical acceptability. In this Series paper, we provide recommendations on how these challenges could be addressed from an interdisciplinary perspective to pave the way towards a framework for mental health care, leveraging the combined strengths of human intelligence and AI.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Ethical Machine Learning in Healthcare', 'abstract': 'The use of machine learning (ML) in healthcare raises numerous ethical concerns, especially as models can amplify existing health inequities.

    "title": "Evaluating Performance Replicability of LLMs in Academic NLP Benchmarks: Research Landscape & Future Directions",
    "current_research_landscape": "The current research landscape centers on the rigorous evaluation and replicability of performance metrics for large language models (LLMs) on academic natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks. Central to this effort is the use of robust clinical measurement methodologies, exemplified by concepts such as 'methods of clinical measurement', 'limits of agreement', 'nonparametric approaches', and statistical transformations like 'logarithmic transformation approach'. Empirical validation often occurs in controlled environments akin to 'sleep laboratory' settings with 'healthy young adults', highlighting emphasis on experimental rigor and replicability. Thematic clusters distill into two dominant focuses: (1) accurate, reproducible stage or state assessments (analogous to 'stage assessment' and 'detecting sleep') reflecting benchmark task performance, and (2) sophisticated statistical methods to manage measurement variability, including handling 'unequal numbers of replicates' and inter-method agreement. This trajectory evolved from foundational works in clinical and sleep research, adapting rigorous statistical frameworks and validation protocols to address the unique challenges of reproducibility and performance consistency in AI evaluations. Thus, the field currently embraces interdisciplinary rigor combining clinical measurement paradigms with AI benchmark evaluation frameworks to enhance reliability and replicability of LLM performance assessments.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite methodological rigor, the evolutionary trajectory reveals persistent challenges in standardizing reproducibility frameworks across diverse datasets and models, partly because existing approaches are heavily influenced by clinical and biometrics research paradigms not originally designed for high-dimensional NLP model outputs. There is a notable scarcity of bridging concepts linking variability in replicate measurements (e.g., 'unequal numbers of replicates') with the inherently dynamic evaluation conditions in NLP tasks. Additionally, the absence of bridge nodes connecting major thematic clusters suggests insufficient integration between experimental validation settings and statistical approaches in model performance assessment. Furthermore, the focus on homogeneous subject groups (e.g., 'healthy young adults') reflects a gap in evaluation diversity and generalizability across varied linguistic and demographic contexts. External/Novel Gaps: The global context analysis points to under-explored interdisciplinary connections—particularly the relevance of 'sleep restriction', 'chronotype measures', and 'within-study variance'—which, metaphorically translated, hint at temporal, individual variability, and longitudinal factors affecting model evaluation that remain overlooked. There is also potential in leveraging biological and psychological constructs (such as affective measures and gene co-regulation insights) as analogies or inspiration for modeling contextual variability and personalizing model evaluation frameworks. This cross-pollination with biomedical sciences is currently untapped in LLM replicability studies, limiting innovative approaches to account for complex, real-world evaluation dynamics.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "1. Development of Adaptive Replicability Protocols Inspired by Biological Rhythms: Leveraging insights from 'chronotype measures' and 'sleep restriction' research, design dynamic evaluation frameworks that model temporal variability and contextual drift in LLM benchmark performance, enabling assessment protocols that adapt to model and data evolution over time. 2. Integrative Statistical Validation Frameworks Bridging Experimental and Measurement Paradigms: Create unified methodological toolsets synthesizing 'methods of clinical measurement' and advanced 'nonparametric approaches' to handle unequal replicates and heterogeneous data conditions specifically tailored for NLP benchmarks, improving robustness and reproducibility. 3. Cross-Disciplinary Personalization of Evaluation Using Psychological and Biomedical Constructs: Inspired by co-concepts like 'positive/negative affect' and 'within-study variance', innovate personalized evaluation metrics that consider user diversity and contextual factors influencing LLM performance, enhancing external validity and practical deployment reliability across diverse populations and use cases."
