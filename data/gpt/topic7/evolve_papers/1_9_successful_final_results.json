        "title": "Human-AI Collaboration Modeling for Bias Mitigation in Clinical LLM Outputs with Focus on Perinatal Mental Health and Global Health Contexts",
        "Problem_Statement": "Biases inherent in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs pose significant clinical risks, particularly in sensitive domains such as perinatal mental health. Existing human-in-the-loop assessments often lack precise mechanistic modeling of how clinician interactions impact bias propagation during decision-making. Furthermore, the scarcity of high-fidelity interaction datasets and globally relevant clinical scenarios limits effective bias mitigation approaches, especially in underrepresented low-resource healthcare settings.",
        "Motivation": "This project addresses critical gaps in bias mitigation by developing a mechanistically detailed computational framework that models diverse clinician-Large Language Model (LLM) collaboration workflows, capturing complex correction and feedback dynamics. By integrating domain-specific, globally relevant scenarios such as perinatal mental health care and leveraging partnerships with institutions like the University Clinics of Kinshasa, the research not only enhances novelty but also broadens societal impact. The approach advances beyond prior work by formalizing adaptive query refinement algorithms informed by real human correction behaviors, offering unprecedented granularity in bias attenuation methods within clinical NLP.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-component computational framework incorporating: (1) a formal probabilistic model of clinician correction workflows derived from clinical interaction patterns, representing diverse clinician biases, correction intensities, and anchoring effects; (2) bias detection algorithms that leverage statistical disparity metrics tailored for clinical subdomains, including perinatal mental health; (3) dynamic query refinement modules driven by Bayesian updating mechanisms, which adapt LLM query formulation in real time based on human feedback signals at defined interaction junctures. The clinician correction model will be parameterized using a combination of expert-curated heuristics and annotated datasets from clinical collaborators at the University Clinics of Kinshasa as well as publicly available medical dialogue corpora (e.g., MedDialog). Algorithmic descriptions will formally specify the interaction dynamics and feedback loops. The framework will use simulation scenarios reflecting both generic clinical workflows and targeted, globally relevant test cases such as gender and cultural biases in perinatal mental health treatment recommendations. This dual focus ensures mechanistic clarity, reproducibility, and context-specific validation of bias mitigation strategies.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Collect existing annotated datasets exhibiting clinical LLM output biases, emphasizing perinatal mental health cases and demographic biases (e.g., gender, ethnicity) from public corpora and University Clinics of Kinshasa collaborations;\n2) Develop formal probabilistic clinician correction workflow models from collected data and clinical expert elicitation;\n3) Implement bias detection algorithms enhanced with domain-specific disparity measures and integrate threshold criteria based on clinical relevance and sensitivity;\n4) Design and implement dynamic Bayesian query refinement algorithms integrating human feedback signals;\n5) Conduct extensive simulated collaborative sessions incorporating variable clinician correction behavior types and intensities to evaluate bias reduction and decision accuracy using quantifiable metrics such as reduction in demographic parity gaps and F1 scores on clinical outcome predictions;\n6) Validate model robustness and generalizability via deployment in pilot studies with clinical partners under ethical guidelines, collecting real-time interaction data for fine-tuning;\n7) Analyze results to formulate best-practice guidelines for synergistic human-AI bias mitigation with special consideration of low-resource and perinatal mental health contexts.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM output recommends a treatment plan for prenatal depression that exhibits implicit gender and cultural biases leading to suboptimal advice for certain demographic groups.\nExpected Output: The simulation models clinicians detecting biases through their correction workflows; clinician overrides trigger dynamic query refinements that adapt future LLM suggestions to minimize repeated bias. Results demonstrate statistically significant reductions in bias metrics without compromising clinical accuracy. Additional case: Application of the framework in simulated scenarios reflecting typical workflows at the University Clinics of Kinshasa, highlighting cultural and resource-specific adaptation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If initial clinician workflow simulations lack sufficient fidelity, prioritize collection and annotation of real clinician-LLM interaction data from partner institutions to recalibrate models. Alternatively, incorporate semi-synthetic data augmentation from public medical dialogue corpora to enrich behavioral diversity. If bias detection algorithms produce excessive false positives, refine metric thresholds guided by clinical expert validation and incorporate ensemble approaches combining automated detection with domain expert signals to improve precision while maintaining recall."
