    "title": "Dynamic Evaluation Scheduling via Chronotype-Inspired Modeling for LLM Testing",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLM evaluations are conducted statically without consideration for the temporal patterns of performance variability, reducing sensitivity to fluctuating model stability.",
    "Motivation": "Building upon the 'chronotype measures' analogy, propose dynamic scheduling of LLM evaluations aligning with performance 'peak' and 'trough' periods inspired by biological rhythms, a novel approach to improve replicability measurement fidelity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a Chronotype-Informed Evaluation Scheduler (CIES) that learns each model's temporal performance signature through sequential benchmark tests and optimizes future evaluation timings to capture critical variability phases. This allows replicability estimation to reflect inherent time-dependent shifts rather than single snapshots.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Conduct repeated benchmark runs across daily cycles on select LLMs. 2. Fit chronotype-like temporal models (e.g., cosinor models) to observed performance time series. 3. Implement CIES to pick evaluation times maximizing measurement informativeness. 4. Test replicability robustness gains versus random or fixed scheduling.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Performance evaluation timestamps and scores over multiple days for a language model on a QA benchmark. Expected Output: Scheduling recommendations for future evaluations focusing on anticipated peak variability intervals to better capture replicability.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If chronotype modeling proves weak, fallback to simpler moving window variance analysis or clustering-based time segmentation to identify meaningful evaluation intervals."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "While the analogy to biological chronotypes is creative, the proposal assumes that LLM performance exhibits consistent, biologically-inspired temporal rhythms (e.g., daily cycles) akin to human chronotypes without prior evidence. This assumption needs preliminary validation: Are LLM instabilities truly rhythmic and predictable rather than random or workload-dependent? Consider incorporating an initial analysis phase explicitly testing for temporal cyclicity and stability patterns before building a scheduling model on this basis. Otherwise, the foundational premise risks undermining the method's relevance and soundness, and the rationale for modeling temporal patterns as cosinor functions might be weak or inaccurate. Detailed justification or pilot data demonstrating temporal structure are critical to establishing the method's validity and motivating the chronological modeling approach robustly in Proposed_Method and Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan sections accordingly to strengthen soundness and alignment with reality of LLM evaluation dynamics and its temporal factors (e.g. infrastructure load, model version changes). This is the most central assumption potentially limiting the entire approach's effectiveness and acceptance in LLM evaluation research contexts. Address this gap first before further architectural or experimental complexity is added in the method or experiments sections to avoid chasing spurious patterns or overfitting noise as rhythms. Without validation, the chronotype analogy remains speculative and methodologically fragile, weakening overall soundness and feasibility substantially, risking wasted effort in experiments or suboptimal scheduler design.  \n\nAction: Add a preliminary study explicitly quantifying temporal rhythmicity or trait-like cyclic structure in evaluation score time series under controlled conditions, with statistical tests for periodicity. If rhythmicity is absent or inconsistent, then fallback or methodological adjustments must be considered at the design stage rather than post hoc, preserving integrity and relevance of the proposed chronotype-inspired scheduler concept. This will also clarify scope and refine methodology for subsequent robust and interpretable modeling of temporal LLM behaviors and replicability assessment enhancements. In sum, rigorously validate the foundational assumption before advancing the proposed method too deeply to solidify soundness and feasibility of the overall research idea along these lines fully. This modification is mandatory to avoid methodological pitfalls and strengthen the core rationale for the entire contribution.  \n\nThis relates to problem statement, proposed method, and experiment plan primarily.  \n\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "Considering the > Global Linked Concept of 'pervasive computing technologies,' integrating this idea within real-world, large-scale evaluation environments—such as decentralized or edge-based LLM deployments where temporal performance fluctuations may critically impact downstream applications—can substantially increase the project's impact and novelty. For instance, designing the Chronotype-Informed Evaluation Scheduler (CIES) to operate in pervasive computing contexts (smart devices, IoT, or edge servers hosting LLM inference) could enable adaptive evaluation and calibration schedules accounting for environmental and contextual temporal dynamics, making replicability assessment more practical and impactful beyond controlled lab settings. \n\nMoreover, leveraging pervasive computing's rich temporal and contextual sensing data could enhance the scheduler's predictive power by incorporating not only time-of-day but also system load, network conditions, or user interaction rhythms into the temporal modeling. This multi-modal temporal signal fusion can provide a more nuanced understanding of model performance variability, differentiating intrinsic model instability from environmental factors common in pervasive deployments. \n\nIn summary, explicitly positioning and adapting the proposed method for pervasive computing scenarios—potentially piloting evaluation scheduling on distributed LLM services or mobile device LLM APIs—would widen the method's applicability, elevate novelty (circumventing the NOV-COMPETITIVE status), and address practical replicability challenges in realistic, heterogeneous operational contexts. This integration suggestion aligns well with the initial concept while enriching its impact and competitiveness at premier conferences."
