    "title": "Multimodal LLMs Integrating Visual and Spatial Reasoning for Mental Health Diagnostics",
    "Problem_Statement": "Mental health assessment lacks robust, real-time NLP systems integrating multimodal behavioral cues like speech, text, and visuals, limiting diagnostic accuracy and interactivity.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses external critical gap of underutilized cross-modal and contextual cues in complex domain tasks, proposing an innovative framework bridging language models with visual and spatial data for richer real-time analysis.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a multimodal architecture combining LLMs with spatial-temporal visual encoding modules capturing facial expressions, gestures, and environment context, integrating outputs via cross-modal attention for holistic interpretation relevant to mental health markers.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "Dataset combining clinical interview transcripts, video recordings, and behavioral annotations. Baselines include unimodal language and visual models. Metrics include diagnostic accuracy, response latency, and multi-class classification F1.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Video and transcript of a patient reporting symptoms with depressed affect. Output: Multimodal diagnosis highlighting linguistic cues and visual affective signals indicating depression severity.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If full multimodal fusion underperforms, isolate visual or textual modalities for separate optimization, or use late fusion ensemble methods for improved robustness."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed multimodal architecture combining LLMs with spatial-temporal visual encoding modules and cross-modal attention is promising but currently underspecified. Key details are missing regarding how visual and spatial features will be encoded and aligned with language model embeddings in real time, especially given complex behavioral signals. Please elaborate the specific model architecture choices, data fusion strategy, and interpretability measures to strengthen the soundness and reproducibility of the proposed approach. Clarifying these mechanisms will help validate assumptions about holistic interpretation for mental health markers and ensure the method is mechanistically feasible and scientifically grounded. For instance, specify if the spatial encoding uses 3D pose estimation or attention over video frames and how temporal dynamics will be incorporated alongside language outputs in the fusion module. Include architectural diagrams if possible to improve clarity and robustness evaluation plans for handling noisy, real-world clinical data modalities combined in this novel way."

          "feedback_content": "To address the challenge that this idea is in a competitive area and to amplify impact, consider integrating Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques and vision-language pre-trained models into your framework. Leveraging pre-trained vision-language models can enhance representation learning of complex, multimodal clinical cues while XAI can provide interpretable diagnostic rationales critical for clinical trust and adoption in mental health settings. Furthermore, exploring federated learning may help maintain patient privacy and data security across institutions while enabling large-scale multimodal model training. These additions can improve your methodâ€™s novelty and practical relevance by combining state-of-the-art multimodal AI advances with important healthcare constraints, differentiating your contribution and accelerating clinical translation potential. Explicitly positioning your framework with these globally linked concepts will also help anticipate and overcome deployment challenges in real-world mental health diagnostics."
