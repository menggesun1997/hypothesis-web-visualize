        "title": "Ethical Implication-Aware Model Compression with Integrated Harm Risk Predictors and Federated Validation for Clinical LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Compressed clinical large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to generating harmful outputs due to potential loss of crucial domain semantics and safety-critical information during compression. Existing compression methods lack rigorous integration of ethical risk assessments and transparent mechanisms to ensure preservation of clinical reasoning and mitigate harm risks, posing significant challenges in high-stakes healthcare environments.",
        "Motivation": "To address the serious ethical and safety challenges of compressing clinical LLMs, this work proposes a novel framework uniquely integrating harm-risk predictive modeling directly into the compression mechanism, coupled with federated learning-based distributed validation to ensure robustness and generalizability across diverse clinical settings. This approach advances beyond prior methods by providing an interpretable, theoretically grounded pruning strategy that enforces safety constraints throughout compression and promotes responsible AI deployment in healthcare.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a threefold method: (1) Develop harm-risk predictors trained on richly annotated clinical adverse event datasets with rigorous label quality checks, designed to output risk attribution scores at parameter and neuron levels; (2) Integrate these predictors explicitly into a modified neural architecture search (NAS) and pruning pipeline, where risk attribution scores guide parameter importance ranking—parameters positively correlated with harm risk receive penalization or guarded pruning thresholds, while essential clinical reasoning parameters are preserved via constraint-based regularization; (3) Incorporate federated learning across multiple clinical institutions’ data silos to validate and fine-tune the harm-risk predictors and compression settings, ensuring reliability across out-of-distribution clinical prompts and demographic shifts. Formal guarantees are established via ablation studies and risk-accuracy trade-off frontiers that document preservation of safety-critical knowledge while optimizing compression ratios. During compression iterations, adaptive thresholds govern pruning decisions under safety constraints, enforced through differentiable regularizers that penalize increases in predicted harm risk. This design is reproducible and robust, enabling high-stakes clinical NLP tasks to benefit from efficient yet ethically-aware compressed models.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Dataset aggregation: Curate multi-institutional clinical adverse event reports harmonized for annotation quality and coverage; augment datasets with federated partners to increase ethical risk label diversity. 2. Harm predictor training: Train and validate risk predictors with cross-validation and uncertainty estimations, measuring prediction precision, recall, and calibration. 3. Compression pipeline: Implement NAS-guided compression incorporating harm-risk-derived pruning constraints; record detailed compression schedules and parameter importance. 4. Evaluation Metrics: Define harm incidence quantitatively as the rate of outputs flagged by harm predictors post-compression, standardized across datasets; measure clinical task accuracy using established bioNLP benchmarks; assess compression ratio and latency. 5. Robustness: Test on out-of-distribution clinical prompts drawn from federated datasets reflecting diverse demographics and conditions; evaluate harm predictor reliability and compressed model safety under these shifts. 6. Trade-off analysis: Plot compression vs. harm incidence vs. accuracy frontiers to define acceptable operational thresholds. 7. Ablation studies: Systematically disable harm-risk guidance to demonstrate its contribution; assess retention of safety-critical parameters. 8. Fallback: Establish and experiment with human-in-the-loop validation protocols where compression decisions flagged as uncertain by harm predictors are reviewed by clinical experts, balancing feasibility and cost.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Complex clinical decision-making prompt, e.g., diagnostic query regarding dementia care or psychiatric evaluation. Baseline: Compressed LLM without harm-risk integration produces plausible but potentially harmful suggestions. Revised model: Outputs clinically accurate, ethically vetted recommendations with risk flags reduced below defined thresholds. For example, the model refrains from suggesting treatments contraindicated in forensic psychiatry or criminal justice contexts where relevant, demonstrating contextual harm reduction. Test cases include patients' electronic health records inputs containing ambiguous or high-risk terminology to verify safety management in real-world influenced scenarios.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If harm-risk predictors lack sufficient reliability, the system will revert to a conservative pruning heuristic that preserves all parameters historically associated with safety-critical clinical reasoning identified via expert curation and prior clinical NLP literature. Additionally, a human-in-the-loop validation phase will be incorporated where clinical domain experts review pruning candidates flagged by the harm-risk model for uncertain ethical impact. This hybrid approach balances automation with expert oversight, minimizing inadvertent semantic loss and mitigating harm risk, informed by pilot studies in federated settings to manage annotation and operational costs."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method lacks sufficient clarity on how the harm-risk predictive models influence the compression process concretely. It is unclear how parameters contributing positively to risk scores will be identified and pruned without degrading essential clinical reasoning capabilities. More detailed algorithmic descriptions or theoretical justifications would strengthen the methodological soundness and ensure safety-critical knowledge is effectively preserved during compression, rather than inadvertently removed or weakened, which could exacerbate harm risks instead of mitigating them. Consider specifying the exact integration mechanism of risk predictions into pruning decisions and how safety constraints are enforced throughout compression iterations to make the method fully reproducible and robust to clinical settings with high stakes outputs, such as by incorporating formal guarantees or ablation studies on critical parameters retention versus risk indicators in early experiments within the plan sections targeted at feasibility assessment yet missing here from the method specification itself. This clarity is pivotal given the ethical sensitivity and risk management goals underlying the project, ensuring the solution’s rationale sufficiently addresses the core technical challenges posed by loss of semantics in compressed clinical LLMs with ethical risk-aware mechanisms as motivation states initially."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The experimental plan, while outlining appropriate datasets, baselines, and metrics, needs further elaboration on procedures ensuring validity and generalizability. It does not detail how harm incidence will be quantitatively defined and measured post-compression, nor whether potential confounders such as dataset imbalance or shifts in clinical task distributions will be accounted for. Moreover, it should specify how annotation quality and coverage of ethical risk labels in adverse event datasets will be ensured or augmented given their critical role in training the harm-risk predictors. Explicitly include validation protocols for harm predictor reliability, specify evaluation on out-of-distribution clinical prompts to test robustness, and define thresholds or statistical standards for acceptable trade-offs between compression ratio, accuracy, and harm reduction. The fallback plan involving human-in-the-loop validation is promising but depends heavily on experimental infrastructure setup and cost feasibility; this also requires more concrete procedural description. Adding these details will enhance the experimental design's rigor, feasibility, and reproducibility in clinical NLP research contexts with high real-world impact and safety demands."
