        "title": "Robust Adaptive Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Biomedical LLMs via Self-Supervised Sparse Subnetwork Discovery and Graph-Guided Domain Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Fine-tuning large biomedical LLMs is resource intensive, and current uniform adaptation methods overlook the heterogeneous and noisy nature of biomedical language, which challenges the reliability and stability of domain-specific sparsity patterns for fine-tuning. There is a need for a robust method that systematically identifies stable, domain-relevant parameter subnetworks that generalize across diverse biomedical tasks and datasets, while leveraging unlabeled domain data and structured biomedical knowledge to guide parameter efficiency and model generalization.",
        "Motivation": "This proposal advances beyond existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning by introducing a novel, rigorously validated approach to discover stable, domain-invariant sparse subnetworks in biomedical LLMs through a self-supervised pre-fine-tuning phase on large unlabeled biomedical corpora. By integrating graph-structured biomedical knowledge, such as entity relations and gene expression profiles, to inform adaptive sparsity patterns, our approach uniquely combines parameter efficiency with biologically meaningful structural priors, enhancing fine-tuning robustness, generalization, and replicability. This integration addresses the NOV-COMPETITIVE status by merging parameter-efficient adaptation, self-supervised domain adaptation, and graph-guided domain generalization, providing a leading-edge contribution in biomedical NLP.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Our method first conducts a self-supervised learning phase on extensive unlabeled biomedical text corpora to identify latent, domain-invariant subnetworks within the pre-trained LLM that are critical for biomedical understanding. We use masked language modeling and contrastive learning objectives to capture generalizable representations. Concurrently, we construct graph-structured domain knowledge from biomedical entity relations and gene expression profiles to encode biologically relevant structures. Sparse subnetwork identification within LLM layers is then guided by this graph-structured data to prioritize parameters aligned with meaningful domain-specific patterns. During adaptive parameter-efficient fine-tuning, we apply low-rank and sparse adapters selectively to these subnetworks informed by both self-supervised discovery and graph-guided constraints. This hybrid strategy is designed to ensure stability and reproducibility of sparsity patterns across heterogeneous biomedical tasks and datasets. Early integration of meta-learning components enables dynamic refinement of important parameters during fine-tuning, enhancing adaptability and reducing reliance on initial assumptions about sparsity stability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect large unlabeled biomedical corpora (e.g., PubMed abstracts, clinical notes) and biomedical knowledge graphs (entity relations, gene expression datasets). 2. Pre-fine-tune a biomedical LLM with self-supervised objectives to identify latent sparse subnetworks. 3. Develop graph-guided mechanisms to align sparsity pattern identification with domain structures. 4. Implement adaptive parameter-efficient fine-tuning using sparse and low-rank adapters on these subnetworks. 5. Benchmark on diverse biomedical NLP downstream tasks: text classification, biomedical QA, and relation extraction datasets. 6. Compare against full fine-tuning, standard adapters, and sparsity-unaware fine-tuning baselines. 7. Evaluate metrics including parameter efficiency, task accuracy, generalization across datasets, fine-tuning costs, and pattern stability. 8. Conduct ablation studies for self-supervised pre-fine-tuning, graph-guidance, and meta-learning components.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A corpus of medical research abstracts from different biomedical subdomains (oncology, immunology) with associated entity-relation graphs and gene expression profiles. Task: Relation extraction and question answering over biomedical entities. Output: High-accuracy predictions using significantly fewer trainable parameters than full fine-tuning, demonstrating robustness and reproducibility of learned sparse subnetworks across subdomains, with faster fine-tuning cycles and improved domain generalization.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If initial assumptions about the stability of domain-specific sparsity patterns prove fragile, we will pivot to a hybrid meta-learning framework integrated from the outset. This framework dynamically identifies and adapts important parameters during fine-tuning via gradient-based meta-optimization, reducing dependency on static sparsity assumptions. Additionally, we will explore augmenting the graph-guided constraints with probabilistic modeling to better capture variability and noise in biomedical domain structures, maintaining robustness and parameter efficiency under uncertainty."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal hinges on the assumption that domain-specific sparsity patterns in large biomedical LLMs can be reliably identified and are stable enough to guide adaptive fine-tuning. However, the inherent variability of biomedical language and model internals may challenge the consistency of these sparsity patterns across tasks and datasets. It would strengthen the soundness to provide preliminary evidence or references supporting the stability and domain relevance of such sparsity patterns before fully committing to this approach. Clarifying how these patterns are identified and validated will also help dispel ambiguity about the assumption's validity and robustness in practice in the biomedical domain, which can be quite heterogeneous and noisy compared to more general NLP domains. This careful validation is crucial to ensure the entire fine-tuning strategy does not rest on a fragile premise that might limit reproducibility and generalizability across biomedical tasks and data sources. Please expand the rationale and methodological details in the Proposed_Method and Problem_Statement sections accordingly to bolster this foundational assumption for the method design and experimental outcomes evaluation.  \n\nFurthermore, considering fallback approaches early is good, but integrating meta-learning only after failure could be expensive; a more hybrid or parallel methodology might be worth discussing for robustness at this early stage of proposal development. \n\nOverall, thoroughly vetting this assumption will safeguard downstream feasibility and impact evaluations and increase confidence in the contribution's scientific rigor and relevance to biomedical LLM fine-tuning challenges.  \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n

Moreover, leveraging 'graph-structured data' representations of domain knowledge (e.g., biomedical entity relations or gene expression profiles) could guide the sparsity pattern identification more precisely, aligning adapter allocation with biologically meaningful structures.
