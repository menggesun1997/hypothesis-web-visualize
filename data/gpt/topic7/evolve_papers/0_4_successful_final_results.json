    "Problem_Statement": "LLM evaluations are conducted statically without consideration for the temporal patterns of performance variability, reducing sensitivity to fluctuating model stability.",
    "Motivation": "Building upon the 'chronotype measures' analogy, propose dynamic scheduling of LLM evaluations aligning with performance 'peak' and 'trough' periods inspired by biological rhythms, a novel approach to improve replicability measurement fidelity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a Chronotype-Informed Evaluation Scheduler (CIES) that learns each model's temporal performance signature through sequential benchmark tests and optimizes future evaluation timings to capture critical variability phases.

        "title": "Validating and Enhancing Dynamic Evaluation Scheduling via Temporal Profiling and Pervasive Computing for LLM Testing",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM evaluations are typically static snapshots, overlooking potential temporal performance variability that may be influenced by model, infrastructure, or environmental factors. Without rigorously validating if such variability exhibits consistent rhythmic or cyclic patterns, scheduling evaluations based on assumed biological analogies risks methodological fragility. Furthermore, existing evaluation strategies rarely consider real-world deployment contexts such as pervasive computing environments, where temporal and contextual factors critically impact model behavior and replicability assessment.",
        "Motivation": "To overcome the NOV-COMPETITIVE status stemming from speculative assumptions, we rigorously investigate and validate temporal performance patterns of LLMs under controlled and real-world pervasive settings. Leveraging evidence-based temporal profiling enables us to strategically schedule evaluations dynamically, improving sensitivity and reliability of replicability measurements over naive static methods. By innovatively integrating pervasive computing concepts—such as edge and IoT-based deployments and environmental/contextual sensing signals—our approach uniquely captures multifaceted temporal influences on LLM stability. This dual focus on empirical rhythm validation and real-world contextual adaptation positions the work as a novel, high-impact, and broadly applicable contribution in the evolving LLM evaluation landscape.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a comprehensive Temporal Profiling and Dynamic Scheduling Framework (TPDSF) for LLM evaluations, comprising two core components: (1) an initial Temporal Rhythmicity Validation Phase that applies rigorous periodicity detection and statistical tests on repeated performance time series collected under controlled conditions to confirm or refute the existence of intrinsic temporal patterns; and (2) a Context-Aware Chronotype-Informed Evaluation Scheduler (CIES) that dynamically plans evaluation timings based on validated temporal performance signatures augmented by pervasive computing contextual signals (e.g., system load, network latency, user interaction rhythms) captured from decentralized and edge-based LLM deployments. This multi-modal temporal modeling framework differentiates intrinsic model instabilities from environmental fluctuations, optimizing replicability assessment accuracy and operational relevance. The scheduler adapts continuously to incoming data, ensuring robustness to infrastructure or workload-induced variability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Controlled Temporal Profiling: Conduct extensive repeated benchmark evaluations on diverse LLMs across multiple time scales (hours, days) under stable infrastructure conditions to generate dense temporal performance data.\n2. Temporal Pattern Analysis: Employ spectral analysis, autocorrelation, and advanced periodicity detection methods (e.g., Lomb-Scargle periodograms) to statistically validate rhythmicity or trait-like cyclic structures in performance metrics.\n3. Pervasive Data Integration: Deploy selected LLMs in edge and IoT environments; collect synchronized performance, system, and contextual sensor data capturing temporal environmental dynamics.\n4. Multi-Modal Temporal Modeling: Develop hybrid models combining cosinor-like functions (if supported by Step 2) with contextual signal fusion via machine learning to characterize temporal variability drivers.\n5. CIES Implementation: Build the dynamic scheduler leveraging validated temporal signatures and context-aware inputs to select evaluation times maximizing informativeness and replicability sensitivity.\n6. Comparative Evaluation: Benchmark replicability robustness and measurement fidelity of CIES against fixed and random evaluation schedules in both controlled and pervasive settings.\n7. Iterative Refinement: Apply ablation studies and fallback strategies (e.g., moving window variance or clustering) if rhythmicity is weak or inconsistent, ensuring framework adaptability and integrity.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A time series dataset consisting of LLM performance scores on a QA benchmark, collected at sub-hourly intervals across several days in both lab and edge deployment settings, including contextual system load and network latency metrics.\nExpected Output: (a) Statistical reports confirming or rejecting temporal cyclicity hypotheses with quantifiable confidence; (b) Dynamic scheduling plans recommending precise evaluation timestamps aligned with detected performance variability peaks and relevant contextual states, enhancing replicability measurement granularity; (c) Comparative replicability scores demonstrating superior sensitivity and robustness of the TPDSF approach relative to traditional evaluation timing schemas.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If rigorous temporal rhythmicity validation reveals inconsistent, weak, or non-periodic performance fluctuations, we revert to a robust fallback approach focusing on non-parametric temporal segmentation. This includes moving window variance analysis and unsupervised clustering on combined performance and contextual data to identify meaningful evaluation intervals characterized by heightened variability or instability. The scheduler then prioritizes these intervals for evaluation, preserving improved replicability assessment without relying on strict rhythmic assumptions. This adaptive fallback ensures the framework’s relevance and efficacy across varied LLM behaviors and deployment scenarios while maintaining methodological soundness."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "While the analogy to biological chronotypes is creative, the proposal assumes that LLM performance exhibits consistent, biologically-inspired temporal rhythms (e.g., daily cycles) akin to human chronotypes without prior evidence. This assumption needs preliminary validation: Are LLM instabilities truly rhythmic and predictable rather than random or workload-dependent? Consider incorporating an initial analysis phase explicitly testing for temporal cyclicity and stability patterns before building a scheduling model on this basis. Otherwise, the foundational premise risks undermining the method's relevance and soundness, and the rationale for modeling temporal patterns as cosinor functions might be weak or inaccurate. Detailed justification or pilot data demonstrating temporal structure are critical to establishing the method's validity and motivating the chronological modeling approach robustly in Proposed_Method and Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan sections accordingly to strengthen soundness and alignment with reality of LLM evaluation dynamics and its temporal factors (e.g. infrastructure load, model version changes). This is the most central assumption potentially limiting the entire approach's effectiveness and acceptance in LLM evaluation research contexts. Address this gap first before further architectural or experimental complexity is added in the method or experiments sections to avoid chasing spurious patterns or overfitting noise as rhythms. Without validation, the chronotype analogy remains speculative and methodologically fragile, weakening overall soundness and feasibility substantially, risking wasted effort in experiments or suboptimal scheduler design.  \n\nAction: Add a preliminary study explicitly quantifying temporal rhythmicity or trait-like cyclic structure in evaluation score time series under controlled conditions, with statistical tests for periodicity. If rhythmicity is absent or inconsistent, then fallback or methodological adjustments must be considered at the design stage rather than post hoc, preserving integrity and relevance of the proposed chronotype-inspired scheduler concept. This will also clarify scope and refine methodology for subsequent robust and interpretable modeling of temporal LLM behaviors and replicability assessment enhancements. In sum, rigorously validate the foundational assumption before advancing the proposed method too deeply to solidify soundness and feasibility of the overall research idea along these lines fully. This modification is mandatory to avoid methodological pitfalls and strengthen the core rationale for the entire contribution.  \n\nThis relates to problem statement, proposed method, and experiment plan primarily.  \n\n\n"

For instance, designing the Chronotype-Informed Evaluation Scheduler (CIES) to operate in pervasive computing contexts (smart devices, IoT, or edge servers hosting LLM inference) could enable adaptive evaluation and calibration schedules accounting for environmental and contextual temporal dynamics, making replicability assessment more practical and impactful beyond controlled lab settings. \n\nMoreover, leveraging pervasive computing's rich temporal and contextual sensing data could enhance the scheduler's predictive power by incorporating not only time-of-day but also system load, network conditions, or user interaction rhythms into the temporal modeling. This multi-modal temporal signal fusion can provide a more nuanced understanding of model performance variability, differentiating intrinsic model instability from environmental factors common in pervasive deployments. \n\nIn summary, explicitly positioning and adapting the proposed method for pervasive computing scenarios—potentially piloting evaluation scheduling on distributed LLM services or mobile device LLM APIs—would widen the method's applicability, elevate novelty (circumventing the NOV-COMPETITIVE status), and address practical replicability challenges in realistic, heterogeneous operational contexts. This integration suggestion aligns well with the initial concept while enriching its impact and competitiveness at premier conferences."
