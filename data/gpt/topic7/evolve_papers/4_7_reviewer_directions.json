          "feedback_content": "The proposal hinges on the assumption that domain-specific sparsity patterns in large biomedical LLMs can be reliably identified and are stable enough to guide adaptive fine-tuning. However, the inherent variability of biomedical language and model internals may challenge the consistency of these sparsity patterns across tasks and datasets. It would strengthen the soundness to provide preliminary evidence or references supporting the stability and domain relevance of such sparsity patterns before fully committing to this approach. Clarifying how these patterns are identified and validated will also help dispel ambiguity about the assumption's validity and robustness in practice in the biomedical domain, which can be quite heterogeneous and noisy compared to more general NLP domains. This careful validation is crucial to ensure the entire fine-tuning strategy does not rest on a fragile premise that might limit reproducibility and generalizability across biomedical tasks and data sources. Please expand the rationale and methodological details in the Proposed_Method and Problem_Statement sections accordingly to bolster this foundational assumption for the method design and experimental outcomes evaluation.  \n\nFurthermore, considering fallback approaches early is good, but integrating meta-learning only after failure could be expensive; a more hybrid or parallel methodology might be worth discussing for robustness at this early stage of proposal development. \n\nOverall, thoroughly vetting this assumption will safeguard downstream feasibility and impact evaluations and increase confidence in the contribution's scientific rigor and relevance to biomedical LLM fine-tuning challenges.  \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n

          "feedback_content": "Given the idea's pre-screened rating as NOV-COMPETITIVE in a crowded space of parameter-efficient fine-tuning and domain adaptation, incorporating concepts from 'self-supervised learning' and 'domain generalization' could substantially enhance the novelty and impact. Specifically, integrating a self-supervised pre-fine-tuning phase that exploits unlabeled biomedical corpora to better capture domain-invariant sparse subnetworks can strengthen robustness and generalization. Moreover, leveraging 'graph-structured data' representations of domain knowledge (e.g., biomedical entity relations or gene expression profiles) could guide the sparsity pattern identification more precisely, aligning adapter allocation with biologically meaningful structures. This fusion would differentiate the work by combining parameter efficiency with deeper domain insights and unsupervised robustness, potentially improving fine-tuning efficiency, model replicability, and downstream task performance across biomedical applications such as relation extraction and biomedical QA. Articulating such concrete integrations inspired by these globally-linked concepts will elevate the paper’s novelty and position it as a leading-edge contribution in the biomedical NLP area."
