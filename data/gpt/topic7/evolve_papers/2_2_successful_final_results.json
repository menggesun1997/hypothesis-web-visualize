    "Problem_Statement": "Existing AutoML tools for LLMs do not integrate traditional machine learning algorithms and CNN techniques, missing replicability enhancement through hybrid architectures and pipeline optimization.",

        "title": "Neural Architecture and Data Augmentation Search for Hybrid Pipeline Optimization in LLM Fine-Tuning Across Diverse Domains",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current AutoML frameworks for LLM fine-tuning often treat traditional machine learning algorithms, CNN-based encoders, and transformers in isolation, lacking a principled approach to integrate and optimize their heterogeneous architectures cohesively. This gap leads to suboptimal pipeline designs with inefficient search heuristics and limited applicability across complex, diverse domains such as medical image analysis and code generation. Moreover, existing methods frequently omit automated data augmentation tailored for text and multimodal inputs, which constrains robustness and generalization. There is a need for a comprehensive AutoML system that simultaneously performs neural architecture search and automatic data augmentation within hybrid pipelines, maximizing performance, replicability, and adaptability.",
        "Motivation": "While previous work combines traditional ML, CNNs, and transformers in pipelines, the lack of coherent architectural integration mechanisms and expansive yet unguided search spaces limit both optimization efficiency and reproducibility. By embedding neural architecture search principles and automated data augmentation strategies specialized for textual and multimodal data, this research aims to elevate hybrid pipeline optimization beyond combinational novelty. The approach targets high-impact domains—such as medical imaging and code generation—where hybrid architectures have demonstrated success, thereby broadening applicability and showcasing the potential for generalizable learning frameworks. Incorporating reinforcement learning and black-box optimization further promises more effective navigation of the complex search landscape, contributing an innovative AutoML paradigm that pushes the frontier in representational diversity and application scope.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a modular AutoML framework that integrates: (1) a neural architecture search engine customized for hybrid pipelines combining transformer embeddings, CNN-based context encoders, and traditional classifiers, (2) an automatic data augmentation module tailored for text and multimodal inputs, and (3) advanced black-box optimization algorithms including reinforcement learning-based controllers to efficiently optimize pipeline structures and hyperparameters. \n\nKey architectural design principles govern component compatibility and feature flow: transformer embeddings produce contextual vector representations feeding into adaptable CNN encoders with dynamic receptive fields tuned via NAS; their output features concatenate with engineered traditional classifier inputs through learned fusion layers ensuring dimensional and semantic alignment. Prompt augmentation components operate upstream by generating enriched input variants, feeding into both embedding and augmentation modules to improve robustness. \n\nThe search space is hierarchically constrained to promote meaningful component interactions—first optimizing individual modules, then joint architectures with fusion parameters—facilitating tractable optimization. Optimization criteria include accuracy, replicability (consistency across retrainings), and generalization across datasets and domains. The framework supports diverse task types (text classification, medical image-text multimodal analysis, code generation) leveraging synthetic data augmentation and domain-specific augmenters within the automated pipeline. This design addresses prior inefficiencies by enabling guided exploration rather than blind expansion.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate benchmark datasets covering NLP text classification (Reuters, IMDB), medical image analysis with accompanying natural language reports, and code generation tasks with executable code datasets.\n2. Develop modular components: transformer embedding modules (e.g., BERT variants), CNN context encoder blocks with dynamic architecture parameters, traditional classifiers (SVM, Random Forest), and prompt/data augmentation modules tailored by domain.\n3. Implement a hierarchical neural architecture search process: (a) optimize individual modules using NAS with reinforcement learning controllers; (b) learn fusion layers that integrate heterogeneous feature representations, constrained by architectural compatibility rules.\n4. Integrate automatic data augmentation pipelines that apply domain-adapted transformations (e.g., synonym replacements for text, data synthesis for images and code).\n5. Employ black-box optimization techniques combining evolutionary strategies and reinforcement learning to jointly optimize pipeline structure, hyperparameters, and augmentation policies.\n6. Benchmark against state-of-the-art AutoML systems limited to single-model paradigms and pure LLM fine-tuning across all domains.\n7. Evaluate performance using accuracy, replicability (variance over multiple independent runs), and cross-domain generalization metrics.\n8. Conduct ablation studies to assess contribution of each module and optimization strategy.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Medical image classification task with associated radiology text descriptions; \nOptimized pipeline includes a BERT-based embedding layer enhanced by automatic prompt augmentation feeding into a CNN architecture whose receptive fields and layer depths are optimized via NAS, followed by a learned fusion layer integrating radiomic features processed by a Random Forest classifier; \nOutput: Highly consistent diagnostic classification with low performance variance across repeats and superior F1 scores relative to traditional fine-tuning baselines.\n\nInput: Code generation task where textual natural language descriptions are augmented by synthetic paraphrasing; \nPipeline integrates transformer embeddings optimized for code semantics, CNN encoders modeling syntactic patterns, and prompt augmentation modules generating diverse input variants; \nOutput: Robust generation of executable code snippets demonstrating improved functional correctness and replicability.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If the combined search space overwhelms optimization convergence, we will introduce a multi-phase optimization strategy: (a) separate optimization of neural architecture and data augmentation modules with domain-specific constraints; (b) fixed fusion strategy integrating selected best-performing modules; (c) reduced complexity pipelines prioritizing components with largest positive impact via pruning. Additionally, scalable surrogate models will approximate pipeline performance to accelerate search. If reinforcement learning-based search struggles, fallback to black-box evolutionary algorithms with prior-informed initialization will be adopted to maintain feasibility."

However, the mechanism lacks clarity on how these heterogeneous components will be effectively integrated and optimized cohesively. For example, the interplay between CNN-based context encoding and transformer embeddings, as well as how prompt augmentation modules feed into or interact with downstream classifiers, is not well-articulated. This ambiguity risks making the evolutionary search inefficient or ineffective without a principled design or constraints on pipeline construction. Clarify the architectural design choices and interaction mechanisms between these components to demonstrate a coherent, well-reasoned integration strategy rather than a loose combination of parts. Include how the pipeline search will ensure meaningful feature flow and parameter compatibility across diverse model types instead of just expanding search space blindly.  This will strengthen the soundness of the method and increase feasibility for optimization convergence and reproducibility goals in hybrid pipelines."
