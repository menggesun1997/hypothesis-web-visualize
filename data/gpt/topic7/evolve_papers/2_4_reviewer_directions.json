    "title": "Neuroscience-Guided Prompt Embedding Regularization for Improved LLM Reproducibility",
    "Problem_Statement": "Reproducibility of LLM outputs varies due to unstable latent representations influenced by prompt embeddings, lacking principled regularization mechanisms.",
    "Motivation": "Utilizes neural decoding and brain-computer interface insights to impose neuroscientifically inspired constraints on prompt embeddings to stabilize latent representations, addressing internal replicability gaps and external cross-disciplinary opportunities.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a regularization technique for prompt embeddings encouraging them to lie in low-dimensional, robust subspaces akin to neural encoding principles observed in brain data. This is enforced via penalties on embedding variance and entropy, guiding prompt engineering for reproducible, interpretable representations within LLMs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Implement regularized prompt embedding layers in transformer models (e.g., GPT-2). 2. Conduct experiments on tasks sensitive to prompt changes (e.g., QA, sentiment analysis). 3. Compare variance and reproducibility metrics across runs with and without regularization. 4. Evaluate interpretability via latent space visualization and human assessment of prompt sensitivity.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A question-answering prompt designed with and without embedding regularization; Expected Output: Stable answer generation across repeated executions and minor synonyms in prompt phrasing under regularization, enhanced inconsistency otherwise.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If regularization reduces model performance, adjust penalty weights or use alternative neuroscientific constraints informed by different brain encoding models. Alternatively, apply adaptive regularization based on task complexity."

          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that neuroscientifically inspired constraints on prompt embeddings will directly translate to improved reproducibility in LLM outputs requires stronger justification or preliminary evidence. Neuroscience encoding principles might not straightforwardly map onto artificial embedding spaces or affect model output stability as hypothesized. Clarify and support this assumption with references or pilot data to strengthen conceptual soundness, or consider alternative theoretical motivations if direct neuroscience analogy is weak or speculative. This is crucial because if this foundational assumption does not hold, subsequent methods and experiments may be invalidated or misguided.\n\nSuggestion: Elaborate on the specific neuroscience findings chosen and explain how properties like low-dimensional robust subspaces reliably translate to embedding regularization benefits. Consider including initial ablation studies or theoretical analysis linking neural encoding principles to embedding stability in language models within the proposal section 'Motivation'. This will solidify the premise and increase confidence in the proposed approach's validity, addressing [SOU-ASSUMPTION].\n\nTarget section: Problem_Statement and Motivation"

          "feedback_content": "While the experimental plan is generally reasonable, it lacks sufficient detail on how key metrics—especially reproducibility and interpretability—will be quantitatively measured and validated. For example, how will \"variance and reproducibility metrics\" be operationalized? What statistical tests or benchmarks will establish significant improvement? How will human assessments be standardized to reduce subjectivity in interpretability evaluations?\n\nFurther, implementation challenges such as the choice of penalty weights, hardware requirements, training stability, and impact on downstream task accuracy are not explicitly addressed. The fallback plan is acknowledged but remains vague regarding contingencies if trade-offs between reproducibility and task performance arise.\n\nSuggestion: Incorporate detailed experimental protocols with specific reproducibility metrics (e.g., output variance statistics, intra-model output agreement with synonymous prompts), clearly defined human evaluation guidelines, and plans for hyperparameter tuning of regularizers. Consider pilot studies or baselines to anchor these evaluations.\n\nThese clarifications will enhance feasibility assessment and experimental rigor, directly addressing [FEA-EXPERIMENT].\n\nTarget section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
