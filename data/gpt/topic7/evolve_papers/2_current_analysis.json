To avoid a time‐consuming and irreproducible manual process of trial‐and‐error to find well‐performing hyperparameter configurations, various automatic hyperparameter optimization (HPO) methods—for example, based on resampling error estimation for supervised machine learning—can be employed. After introducing HPO from a general perspective, this paper reviews important HPO methods, from simple techniques such as grid or random search to more advanced methods like evolution strategies, Bayesian optimization, Hyperband, and racing. This work gives practical recommendations regarding important choices to be made when conducting HPO, including the HPO algorithms themselves, performance evaluation, how to combine HPO with machine learning pipelines, runtime improvements, and parallelization.

To fit a machine learning model into different problems, its hyper-parameters must be tuned. Selecting the best hyper-parameter configuration for machine learning models has a direct impact on the model’s performance. It often requires deep knowledge of machine learning algorithms and appropriate hyper-parameter optimization techniques. Although several automatic optimization techniques exist, they have different strengths and drawbacks when applied to different types of problems. In this paper, optimizing the hyper-parameters of common machine learning models is studied. We introduce several state-of-the-art optimization techniques and discuss how to apply them to machine learning algorithms. Many available libraries and frameworks developed for hyper-parameter optimization problems are provided, and some open challenges of hyper-parameter optimization research are also discussed in this paper. Moreover, experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets to compare the performance of different optimization methods and provide practical examples of hyper-parameter optimization. This survey paper will help industrial users, data analysts, and researchers to better develop machine learning models by identifying the proper hyper-parameter configurations effectively.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Regression Shrinkage and Selection Via the Lasso', 'abstract': 'SUMMARY We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The ‘lasso’ minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'TPOT: A Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization Tool for Automating Machine Learning', 'abstract': 'As data science becomes increasingly mainstream, there will be an ever-growing demand for data science tools that are more accessible, flexible, and scalable. In response to this demand, automated machine learning (AutoML) researchers have begun building systems that automate the process of designing and optimizing machine learning pipelines. In this chapter we present TPOT v0.3, an open source genetic programming-based AutoML system that optimizes a series of feature preprocessors and machine learning models with the goal of maximizing classification accuracy on a supervised classification task. We benchmark TPOT on a series of 150 supervised classification tasks and find that it significantly outperforms a basic machine learning analysis in 21 of them, while experiencing minimal degradation in accuracy on 4 of the benchmarks—all without any domain knowledge nor human input. As such, genetic programming-based AutoML systems show considerable promise in the AutoML domain.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'COCO: a platform for comparing continuous optimizers in a black-box setting', 'abstract': 'We introduce COCO, an open-source platform for Comparing Continuous Optimizers in a black-box setting.

The platform and the underlying methodology allow to benchmark in the same framework deterministic and stochastic solvers for both single and multiobjective optimization. We present the rationals behind the (decade-long) development of the platform as a general proposition for guidelines towards better benchmarking. We detail underlying fundamental concepts of COCO such as the definition of a problem as a function instance, the underlying idea of instances, the use of target values, and runtime defined by the number of function calls as the central performance measure.

In this paper, we suggest a nondominated sorting-based multiobjective EA (MOEA), called nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), which alleviates all the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast nondominated sorting approach with $O(MN^{2})$ computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best (with respect to fitness and spread) $N$ solutions. Simulation results on difficult test problems show that the proposed NSGA-II, in most problems, is able to find much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to Pareto-archived evolution strategy and strength-Pareto EA—two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multiobjective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multiobjective optimizer and much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Matplotlib: A 2D Graphics Environment', 'abstract': 'Matplotlib is a 2D graphics package used for Python for application development, interactive scripting,and publication-quality image generation across user interfaces and operating systems'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'A Comparison of Pooling Methods for Convolutional Neural Networks', 'abstract': 'One of the most promising techniques used in various sciences is deep neural networks (DNNs). A special type of DNN called a convolutional neural network (CNN) consists of several convolutional layers, each preceded by an activation function and a pooling layer. The feature map of the previous layer is sampled by the pooling layer (that seems to be an important layer) to create a new feature map with condensed resolution. This layer significantly reduces the spatial dimension of the input. It always accomplished two main goals. As a first step, it reduces the number of parameters or weights to minimize computational costs. The second step is to prevent the overfitting of the network. In addition, pooling techniques can significantly reduce model training time and computational costs. This paper provides a critical understanding of traditional and modern pooling techniques and highlights the strengths and weaknesses for readers. Moreover, the performance of pooling techniques on different datasets is qualitatively evaluated and reviewed.
