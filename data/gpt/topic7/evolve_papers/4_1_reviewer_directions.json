          "feedback_content": "While the concept of adaptive sparsity dynamically pruning attention heads and layers based on input complexity and domain-relevance scores is promising, the mechanism lacks clarity on how complexity and relevance are quantified, integrated, and how pruning decisions are efficiently and reliably made during inference. Providing a detailed algorithmic framework with examples and justifications for chosen metrics, thresholds, and pruning schedules would significantly strengthen the soundness of the proposed method. Without this, the feasibility and effectiveness of adaptive sparsity remain uncertain, risking performance deterioration or computational overhead that negates green gains, especially in complex biomedical NLP tasks with nuanced input variations. Clarify and substantiate this mechanism thoroughly in the proposal to ensure rigorous understanding and reproducibility of the approach, which is critical for this highly competitive domain and for peer acceptance at top conferences such as ACL or NeurIPS.\n\n"

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step experiment plan identifies suitable biomedical corpora (MedNLI, PubMedQA) and relevant baselines (BioBERT, ClinicalBERT), but it could be strengthened by explicitly specifying evaluation protocols for measuring computational cost and energy consumption, including hardware details, measurement tools, and consistency standards. Furthermore, it does not address the potential variability and practical challenges of implementing dynamic sparsity during inference, such as latency overhead or hardware compatibility, which could affect feasibility. Incorporating experiments that profile the impact of adaptive sparsity overhead, stability during fine-tuning, and comparing with established model compression techniques like quantization or pruning baselines under controlled settings would increase the scientific rigor and practical readiness of the study. Clarify fallback triggers quantitatively to help decide when to revert to static sparsity or quantization, ensuring robust empirical validation and reliable conclusions on feasibility and efficiency gains."
