        "title": "Dynamic Epidemiology-Driven LLM Evaluation Framework",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM evaluation frameworks largely rely on static benchmarks and lack real-time adaptation to evolving epidemiological contexts, resulting in poor replicability and safety assessments in real-world clinical deployments for public health applications.",
        "Motivation": "This addresses the critical external gap of integrating real-time public health data from agencies like the CDC with LLM evaluation, fulfilling Innovation Opportunity 1 to overcome shortcomings of static benchmarks and improve model replicability in dynamic environments.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose building a dynamic evaluation platform that ingests continuous real-time CDC surveillance data streams and pairs them with LLM-generated clinical and public health queries. The system will automatically generate updated benchmarks reflecting current epidemiological trends and assess model responses for accuracy, bias, and safety in this changing context. Evaluation metrics will include drift detection, response consistency over time, and epidemiological relevance, enforced via an automated feedback loop to trigger model recalibration protocols.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Collect historical and real-time CDC public health data and curated clinical questions reflecting ongoing outbreaks.\n(2) Select state-of-the-art models like Med-PaLM and baseline LLMs.\n(3) Develop the dynamic benchmark generator updating queries and answer keys based on new data.\n(4) Evaluate models periodically to detect performance drift.\n(5) Compare with static benchmark results.\n(6) Use expert clinicians to verify flagged degraded outputs.\n(7) Assess system scalability and timeliness of feedback.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"What are current CDC guidelines for influenza vaccination in 2024?\" (with input dataset reflecting latest CDC influenza updates)\nExpected Output: Accurate, up-to-date recommendations consistent with CDC data, including target populations and vaccine efficacy notes.\nThe system flags inconsistencies if the LLM uses outdated information or shows bias.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time data integration is infeasible, fallback to simulated epidemiological drift datasets or periodic manual data updates. If model recalibration does not improve results, analyze data inconsistencies or redesign benchmark query generation algorithms."
