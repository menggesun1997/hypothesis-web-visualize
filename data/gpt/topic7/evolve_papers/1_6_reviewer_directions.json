    "title": "Socio-Technical Workflow Aware LLM Evaluation Simulator",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM evaluations often ignore the complex socio-technical factors involved in clinician-AI interaction workflows, resulting in misleading assessments that do not reflect real-world usage variance and safety implications.",
    "Motivation": "Targets the critical internal gap concerning socio-technical influences on LLM replicability by simulating clinician-AI workflows in evaluation, providing a controlled environment to observe interaction effects and safety risks, an unexplored intersection highlighted in the research landscape.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a clinically inspired workflow simulator that models sequences of clinician interactions with AI outputs, including iteration loops, overrides, and trust modifications. Integrate this with LLM output generation and error injection to test how workflow factors shape final decision accuracy, bias propagation, and user reliance dynamics. The system supports scenario-based evaluation and human-in-the-loop analyses.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Map common clinical workflows involving AI support.\n(2) Implement simulation modules with configurable parameters.\n(3) Generate LLM output variants with controlled error profiles.\n(4) Simulate clinician decisions influenced by these outputs.\n(5) Measure downstream impact on diagnostic accuracy and error recovery.\n(6) Validate simulator outputs against real-world workflow data.\n(7) Use findings to inform safer AI deployment guidelines.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Simulated workflow where LLM returns conflicting diagnosis suggestions.\nExpected Output: Simulator demonstrates how clinicians correct or adopt suggestions, modeling trust and error mitigation pathways.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If workflow complexity is excessive, focus on simplified canonical sequences. If human behavioral parameters are unavailable, use proxy models derived from literature or expert elicitation."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that simulating clinician-AI workflows with configurable parameters and error injection accurately captures the real-world interplay of socio-technical factors, trust dynamics, and iterative decision-making. However, this core assumption risks oversimplification without detailed empirical grounding and a clear model of clinician behavior nuances. To strengthen soundness, explicitly justify the fidelity of behavioral models or provide preliminary validation steps and sources that confirm the assumptions about interaction patterns, trust evolution, and error correction pathways within clinical settings. This is essential because socio-technical interactions are complex, variable by context, and influenced by factors that might not be fully capturable in simulation alone, which could limit the reliability of findings if left unexamined or poorly validated. This critique targets the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections for clearer foundational grounding and validation planning to ensure the simulation’s premise is robust and credible in representing real clinical workflows and decision contexts.\" ,\"target_section\":\"Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method\"},{\"feedback_code\":\"FEA-EXPERIMENT\",\"feedback_content\":\"The proposed step-by-step experiment plan is comprehensive but ambitious, particularly the later stages involving validation against real-world workflow data and modeling clinician decisions influenced by AI outputs. Practical feasibility may be hindered by challenges in obtaining sufficiently rich and representative real-world clinical workflow datasets and in accurately modeling human behavioral responses (e.g., trust modification, error mitigation). To improve feasibility, the plan should explicitly detail strategies for data access, human subject study designs or expert elicitation protocols, and scalable proxy modeling methods. Also, clarifying fallback operationalization—such as the criteria for choosing canonical workflows or proxy models—and specifying incremental milestones to demonstrate partial outcomes would make the plan more actionable and realistic. Feedback targets the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section, urging refinement to enhance practical feasibility and contingency planning for the most challenging experimental stages.\" ,\"target_section\":\"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\"}]}  The primary focus is on foundational soundness of socio-technical assumptions and practical feasibility of the experimental validation approach, which are critical prerequisites for this hybrid novelty approach to yield meaningful, trustworthy contributions. Addressing these will substantially strengthen the work’s internal foundations and readiness for impactful application.  There are no globally linked concepts provided, so no suggestion for global integration is added.  This targeted feedback supports a high-leverage path forward for refining and maturing the research idea effectively.  "
