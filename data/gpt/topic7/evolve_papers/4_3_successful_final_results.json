        "title": "Explainable Knowledge-Infused Compression for Replicable Clinical LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing model compression techniques for clinical large language models (LLMs) typically neglect structured expert knowledge integration, leading to compromised interpretability, loss of critical clinical information, and potential safety risks in deployment. Without a systematic mechanism to embed clinical ontologies directly into compression algorithms, maintaining both model efficiency and trustworthy explainability remains unresolved.",
        "Motivation": "While prior works achieve compression and some explainability separately, our approach innovatively marries Explainable AI principles with knowledge graph–guided compression in clinical LLMs, addressing an underexplored nexus. This fills a crucial gap by ensuring that compressed models not only remain computationally efficient but also retain validated domain knowledge with rigorously quantifiable explainability, supported by formalized mechanisms. By leveraging knowledge representation combined with deep feature extraction and attention mechanisms within the compression pipeline, this methodology advances the state-of-the-art in ethically responsible, replicable clinical AI systems.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel compression framework that systematically integrates clinical knowledge graphs (e.g., UMLS) into the pruning and distillation processes of a pretrained clinical LLM (e.g., BioBERT extended with recurrent neural network modules to capture sequential clinical context). The key mechanism involves: \n\n1. **Parameter-Knowledge Mapping:** Map model parameters (e.g., neurons, attention heads, or weights) to clinical entities and relations by tracing feature extraction layers and attention weights linked to knowledge graph nodes through a defined alignment function leveraging knowledge representation embeddings.\n\n2. **Scoring and Prioritization:** Compute a relevance score for each parameter based on its contribution to knowledge graph–linked features. This quantifies the importance concerning clinical entities and relations using metrics like integrated gradients and attention fidelity scores.\n\n3. **Guided Pruning Algorithm:** Employ a constrained optimization approach that minimizes model size while preserving high-scoring parameters. The pruning decision respects the knowledge-informed scores as soft constraints within the loss function, ensuring core clinical knowledge retention.\n\n4. **Explainability Quantification:** Post-compression, generate explanation maps linking output predictions to knowledge graph nodes and quantify explainability using fidelity (agreement between explanations and model behavior), plausibility (expert-validated alignment with domain knowledge), and completeness metrics.\n\n5. **Algorithmic Illustrations:** To ensure reproducibility, we provide pseudo-code specifying the parameter-to-entity alignment process, scoring computations, and constrained pruning steps, making explicit how knowledge graph structure enforces compression decisions.\n\nThis framework innovates beyond standard pruning by tightly coupling model internals with formal domain knowledge, enhanced by convolutional neural network layers within feature extraction modules to capture spatial clinical pattern representations and improve knowledge alignment fidelity.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. **Data and Models:** Use clinical text corpora annotated with UMLS and related ontologies; start from BioBERT extended with RNN and CNN layers for richer representation.\n\n2. **Baselines:** Compare against standard pruning and distillation techniques without knowledge guidance.\n\n3. **Metrics:** Evaluate compression rate, diagnostic accuracy (e.g., clinical entity recognition, disease classification), and detailed explainability using:\n   - Fidelity scores measuring how well explanation maps reflect true model behavior.\n   - Plausibility quantified via a rubric developed with domain experts assessing explanation validity.\n   - Completeness metrics ensuring explanations capture all relevant features.\n\n4. **Expert Evaluation:** Engage at least 5 clinical experts to annotate a representative sample (>500 clinical reports) using a predefined scoring rubric and inter-rater reliability analysis to standardize explainability assessment and minimize subjective bias.\n\n5. **Computational Resource and Timeline Considerations:** Estimate overhead introduced by knowledge graph integration and constrained pruning; implement optimizations such as batching and parallelized mapping computations. Conduct feasibility pilot within first 2 months; full experiments over 6 months.\n\n6. **Safety and Deployment Feasibility:** Measure inference time post-compression to ensure clinical deployment standards are met and perform safety evaluations detecting potential harmful outputs using a curated clinical test set.\n\n7. **Statistical Analysis:** Use statistical significance tests to compare explainability and accuracy metrics against baselines.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A clinical report describing a rare genetic disorder, mentioning multiple symptoms, medications, and lab results.\n\nOutput:\n - Compressed model accurately identifies the rare disorder and related clinical entities.\n - Explanation map highlights knowledge graph nodes corresponding to symptoms and gene mutations influencing the prediction.\n - Quantitative explainability scores surpass uncompressed and standard compressed baselines, confirmed by expert annotations.\n\nAnother test involves contrasting cases with comorbidities to demonstrate the model's ability to explain multi-entity interactions via the knowledge graph, ensuring robustness and interpretability in complex clinical scenarios.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should the strict knowledge-graph guided pruning degrade predictive performance or introduce excessive computational overhead, pivot to:\n\n- A soft regularization approach incorporating knowledge constraints as penalty terms rather than hard pruning limits during compression.\n- Hybrid knowledge-driven distillation where a compressed student model learns from a knowledge-aware teacher, emphasizing salient domain parameters.\n- Augment the knowledge representation with generative adversarial networks to synthesize supportive clinical features enhancing feature extraction layers.\n\nThese alternatives maintain the principle of knowledge infusion and explainability with potentially smoother optimization landscapes and reduced resource demands."

However, the mechanism by which model parameters are systematically mapped and scored against knowledge graph nodes requires clearer elaboration. Specifically, how the integration affects the compression algorithm’s optimization process and how explainability is quantitatively ensured post-compression are unclear. Clarifying this will strengthen confidence in the method's soundness and reproducibility, beyond high-level intuition, e.g., specifying how parameters are linked to clinical entities and how pruning decisions are operationalized respecting model internals and knowledge representation structure is essential. Consider detailing algorithmic steps or pseudo-code illustrating this integration explicitly in the paper to address this gap in mechanism clarity and to mitigate assumptions about the feasibility of such mapping and pruning effectiveness in complex clinical LLMs. This critique targets the Proposed_Method section directly to improve the core scientific grounding of the approach's soundness and clarity of contribution, avoiding ambiguous claims about knowledge-infused compression benefits without clear procedural backing or validation strategy intrinsic to method design stages rather than only in experiments or fallback plans."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is generally well-directed, employing UMLS and BioBERT as a meaningful testbed; however, it lacks concrete details on the evaluation protocols for explainability and how expert evaluation will be standardized or quantified. For a critical domain like clinical NLP, demonstrating explainability requires rigorous metrics or annotation schemes and predefined criteria for expert assessments to avoid subjective bias. Additionally, the plan does not discuss computational resource requirements or timeline feasibility, especially as knowledge-graph guided pruning could introduce nontrivial overhead compared to standard compression methods. Strengthening the experiment plan by specifying precise metrics (e.g., fidelity, plausibility of attention maps), controlled baseline comparisons, number of expert annotators, and sample sizes for clinical text sets would substantiate feasibility. Furthermore, consideration of real-world clinical deployment constraints—such as inference time post-compression and safety evaluation protocols—would ensure the experiments are both scientifically sound and practically feasible with clear success criteria. This addresses the feasibility focus targeting the Experiment_Plan to ensure the approach’s practical and methodological rigour before further development."
