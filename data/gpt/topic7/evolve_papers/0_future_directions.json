        "title": "Temporal Dynamics Modeling for LLM Benchmark Replicability",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current replicability assessments of LLMs inadequately capture performance fluctuations over time, ignoring temporal variability analogous to biological rhythms, resulting in incomplete evaluation profiles.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap of temporal and longitudinal factors ('sleep restriction', 'chronotype measures') overlooked in LLM evaluation, bridging biomedical insights with NLP model temporal dynamics for adaptive replicability protocols.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a Temporal Dynamics Replicability Framework (TDRF) that tracks, models, and predicts LLM benchmark performances across multiple evaluation windows, integrating time-series modeling (e.g., recurrent neural nets or temporal Gaussian processes) inspired by chronobiology patterns. This framework adapts evaluation schedules and interpretations dynamically based on inferred performance cycles and drifts.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect benchmark performance data of select LLMs across diverse NLP tasks at multiple time points. 2. Design controlled perturbations simulating 'contextual drift' to mimic real-world temporal changes. 3. Develop TDRF incorporating temporal models. 4. Compare replicability metrics with static evaluations. 5. Validate using metrics like test-retest reliability, prediction error on future performances, and agreement limits.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Performance scores of an LLM on the GLUE benchmark measured biweekly over 12 weeks. Expected Output: Identification of performance cycles, temporal variability estimates, and adaptive confidence intervals reflecting expected fluctuations rather than static values.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If temporal models fail to capture meaningful patterns, fallback to simpler segmented statistical comparisons (e.g., early vs late phases), or augment the approach with meta-data such as computational environment logs to explain variability."

        "title": "Unified Statistical Framework for Unequal Replicates in NLP Evaluations",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing replicability frameworks inadequately manage datasets with unequal replicate numbers per NLP task or model evaluation, undermining robustness and interpretability of performance comparisons.",
        "Motivation": "Targets the critical internal gap regarding handling 'unequal numbers of replicates' by merging clinical measurement methods with advanced nonparametric statistics, creating an integrative validation approach tailored for NLP benchmarks.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Construct a statistical toolkit combining weighted nonparametric rank-based tests with variance-stabilizing transformation methods that adjust for unbalanced replicates. The framework incorporates inter-method agreement metrics from clinical research adapted for NLP assessments, allowing nuanced performance concordance analysis across heterogeneous data conditions.",

Apply traditional replicate-ignoring statistics vs proposed weighted methods. 3. Evaluate robustness, false positive rates, and agreement measures. 4. Deploy framework on real-world NLP benchmarks exhibiting unequal replicates (e.g., different number of runs per model).",

        "title": "Personalized Evaluation Metrics Inspired by Affective Neuroscience for NLP Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current performance replicability assessments overlook diversity in user interaction contexts and psychological factors influencing perceived model quality, limiting external validity across populations.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap linking psychological and biomedical constructs to LLM evaluation, specifically leveraging analogies from 'positive/negative affect' and user contextual variability to personalize evaluation metrics enhancing deployment relevance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a Personalized Evaluation Framework (PEF) that models user affective states and contextual features as latent variables influencing model output quality. The PEF integrates multi-modal user data (e.g., demographics, interaction logs) with linguistic performance to generate adaptive metrics weighted by personalized factors, inspired by co-regulation principles from biology.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect NLP task performance data alongside simulated or real user affective and contextual profiles. 2. Model the interaction between performance and context via latent factor analysis or variational autoencoders. 3. Define personalized metric functions adapting standard benchmarks (e.g., BLEU, accuracy) via learned user-context weights. 4. Validate improved correlation with user satisfaction ratings and replicability across diverse groups.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Text generation outputs from an LLM evaluated by users with different affective profiles (e.g., positive vs negative mood). Expected Output: Personalized evaluation scores reflecting nuanced quality perceptions aligned with user contexts, differing from standard aggregate metrics.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If affective contextualization shows weak correlation, fallback to clustering users into representative groups and apply group-wise adjusted metrics or incorporate additional biosignal proxies (e.g., heart rate variability) to enrich context modeling."

Fit chronotype-like temporal models (e.g., cosinor models) to observed performance time series. 3. Implement CIES to pick evaluation times maximizing measurement informativeness. 4. Test replicability robustness gains versus random or fixed scheduling.",
