    "title": "Cross-Disciplinary Public Health-AI Model Drift Analyzer",
    "Problem_Statement": "There is a lack of systematic evaluation methods for LLM performance drift and variance in dynamic clinical settings, especially integrating public health data and socio-technical workflows, compromising safety in evolving real-world applications.",
    "Motivation": "This project bridges the internal gap in evaluating deployment variance and the external gap of untapped synergies between CDC data and AI monitoring, aligning with Innovation Opportunity 1 to systematically capture model drift within real-time epidemiological and clinical operational contexts.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design a comprehensive model drift analyzer combining continuous LLM output monitoring, data provenance tracking, and socio-technical workflow modeling. Integrate statistical drift detection algorithms with real-time public health surveillance inputs. Include clinician interaction logs to correlate performance changes with workflow variability, enabling proactive mitigation strategies through adaptive retraining triggers.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Obtain LLM outputs from production clinical environments.\n(2) Collect corresponding public health datasets and clinician workflow metadata.\n(3) Implement drift detection algorithms (e.g., population stability index, KL divergence).\n(4) Analyze correlations between drift events and workflow changes.\n(5) Validate findings with clinician feedback.\n(6) Develop dashboard visualizations for ongoing monitoring.\n(7) Propose retraining/refinement cycles triggered by detected drift.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input Stream: LLM responses on infectious disease queries combined with timestamped clinician edits.\nExpected Output: Early detection of drift when LLM responses diverge from updated CDC guidance or clinician corrections spike, prompting alert and remediation.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If clinician workflow data is sparse, simulate interaction patterns or supplement with structured logs. If drift signals are noisy, refine detection thresholds or incorporate additional contextual metadata."

Obtaining real-time clinician workflow metadata and accurately linking it with LLM outputs and public health data in production clinical environments can be highly challenging due to privacy, heterogeneity, and operational constraints. To improve feasibility, the proposal should clarify strategies for data collection agreements, preprocessing standardization, and system integration architecture. Additionally, clear fallback methodologies beyond simulation (e.g., anonymized or aggregated proxy data sources) should be elaborated to mitigate sparse clinician workflow data scenarios effectively without compromising validity of drift analysis results. This will strengthen confidence that the experimental validation is practical and scientifically rigorous given clinical deployment complexities, which is essential for successful demonstration and adoption of the analyzer toolchain in real-world settings.

          "feedback_content": "To enhance the impact and novelty beyond a hybrid approach, the proposal should explicitly integrate concepts from 'clinical decision support' and 'Transformer-based language models' within healthcare workflows, possibly by incorporating real-time feedback loops where drift detection directly informs clinical decision support system adjustments. Including epidemiological variables from CDC data with evidence gap mapping techniques could also help prioritize the most critical drift-prone scenarios linked to public health risks. Additionally, bridging this work with systematic review methodologies or pre-hospital care data streams would broaden applicability and relevance, especially for high-impact domains like infectious disease outbreak response. This cross-disciplinary integration will differentiate the approach, potentially advancing state-of-the-art AI safety monitoring in health AI deployments with strong translational benefits.
