ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot produced through sophisticated fine-tuning of an LLM, and other tools are emerging through similar developmental processes. Here we outline how LLM applications such as ChatGPT are developed, and we discuss how they are being leveraged in clinical settings. We consider the strengths and limitations of LLMs and their potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical, educational and research work in medicine. LLM chatbots have already been deployed in a range of biomedical contexts, with impressive but mixed results. This review acts as a primer for interested clinicians, who will determine if and how LLM technology is used in healthcare for the benefit of patients and practitioners.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Comparing Physician and Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Responses to Patient Questions Posted to a Public Social Media Forum', 'abstract': 'Importance: The rapid expansion of virtual health care has caused a surge in patient messages concomitant with more work and burnout among health care professionals. Artificial intelligence (AI) assistants could potentially aid in creating answers to patient questions by drafting responses that could be reviewed by clinicians.\\nObjective: To evaluate the ability of an AI chatbot assistant (ChatGPT), released in November 2022, to provide quality and empathetic responses to patient questions.\\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, a public and nonidentifiable database of questions from a public social media forum (Reddit\\'s r/AskDocs) was used to randomly draw 195 exchanges from October 2022 where a verified physician responded to a public question. Chatbot responses were generated by entering the original question into a fresh session (without prior questions having been asked in the session) on December 22 and 23, 2022. The original question along with anonymized and randomly ordered physician and chatbot responses were evaluated in triplicate by a team of licensed health care professionals. Evaluators chose \"which response was better\" and judged both \"the quality of information provided\" (very poor, poor, acceptable, good, or very good) and \"the empathy or bedside manner provided\" (not empathetic, slightly empathetic, moderately empathetic, empathetic, and very empathetic). Mean outcomes were ordered on a 1 to 5 scale and compared between chatbot and physicians.\\nResults: Of the 195 questions and responses, evaluators preferred chatbot responses to physician responses in 78.6% (95% CI, 75.0%-81.8%) of the 585 evaluations. Mean (IQR) physician responses were significantly shorter than chatbot responses (52 [17-62] words vs 211 [168-245] words; t\\u2009=\\u200925.4; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001). Chatbot responses were rated of significantly higher quality than physician responses (t\\u2009=\\u200913.3; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001). The proportion of responses rated as good or very good quality (≥ 4), for instance, was higher for chatbot than physicians (chatbot: 78.5%, 95% CI, 72.3%-84.1%; physicians: 22.1%, 95% CI, 16.4%-28.2%;). This amounted to 3.6 times higher prevalence of good or very good quality responses for the chatbot. Chatbot responses were also rated significantly more empathetic than physician responses (t\\u2009=\\u200918.9; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001). The proportion of responses rated empathetic or very empathetic (≥4) was higher for chatbot than for physicians (physicians: 4.6%, 95% CI, 2.1%-7.7%; chatbot: 45.1%, 95% CI, 38.5%-51.8%; physicians: 4.6%, 95% CI, 2.1%-7.7%). This amounted to 9.8 times higher prevalence of empathetic or very empathetic responses for the chatbot.\\nConclusions: In this cross-sectional study, a chatbot generated quality and empathetic responses to patient questions posed in an online forum. Further exploration of this technology is warranted in clinical settings, such as using chatbot to draft responses that physicians could then edit. Randomized trials could assess further if using AI assistants might improve responses, lower clinician burnout, and improve patient outcomes.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'The Parable of Google Flu: Traps in Big Data Analysis', 'abstract': 'Large errors in flu prediction were largely avoidable, which offers lessons for the use of big data.\\n In February 2013, Google Flu Trends (GFT) made headlines but not for a reason that Google executives or the creators of the flu tracking system would have hoped.

Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what ‘research’ means?

However, human evaluation reveals key gaps. To resolve this, we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, knowledge recall and reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine.

    "current_research_landscape": "The current research in assessing large language model (LLM) performance replicability in real-world production systems centers on leveraging generative artificial intelligence to tackle complex, free-text queries within healthcare and biomedical contexts. Foundational works transitioned from broad critical examinations of Big Data's validity and digital labor sampling biases towards embedding LLMs, exemplified by ChatGPT and domain-specific models like BioGPT, into clinical question answering and medical education tasks. The prevailing methodology combines large-scale benchmark evaluations with human-in-the-loop assessments addressing accuracy, reasoning, factuality, and biases, reflecting a maturation from automated metrics to nuanced, domain-aware human evaluation frameworks. Central nodes like 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Google Flu Trends', and 'online labor markets' reveal how the field critically incorporates real-world data reliability and experimental subject sourcing via platforms like Mechanical Turk, highlighting the integration of dataset provenance and socio-technical factors. Thematic islands organize the research foci around public health surveillance, AI-driven healthcare applications, and the socio-technical dimensions of online labor, emphasizing a multifaceted approach blending biomedical, AI, and human factors considerations.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps persist in replicability and generalizability, especially concerning the translation of promising LLM results from controlled benchmark settings to safety-critical, high-stakes clinical environments. Despite advances, models like Med-PaLM remain inferior to clinicians, exposing a gap in robust reasoning, contextual comprehension, and mitigation of harmful biases. The field has also underexplored systematic evaluation of real-world deployment variance and drift in dynamic clinical settings, and the influence of socio-technical factors such as clinician-AI interaction workflows. Externally, cross-disciplinary connections elucidated in the Global Context are largely untapped. Notably, the potential synergy between 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention' and 'artificial intelligence' for enhancing public health strategies and infection control is seldom integrated into LLM evaluation frameworks. Similarly, leveraging online labor market insights (e.g., 'MTurk sample') alongside AI for scalable, reliable human evaluation and annotation is underdeveloped. Furthermore, integrating health communication research—spanning patient-centered care and behavioral change—with LLM performance studies could facilitate more empathetic, effective AI-human interfaces in clinical practice.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "1. Develop adaptive LLM assessment platforms that incorporate real-time public health data streams (e.g., CDC surveillance) to dynamically evaluate model replicability and safety in evolving epidemiological contexts. This capitalizes on the latent link between public health monitoring and AI performance robustness, addressing shortcomings in static benchmarks.\n\n2. Create hybrid human-AI evaluation ecosystems leveraging online labor markets (like Mechanical Turk) combined with domain experts to provide scalable, high-fidelity assessment of LLM outputs under diverse real-world conditions. This merges the socio-technical insights on labor market sampling with AI evaluation needs, improving generalizability and reducing annotation biases.\n\n3. Integrate interdisciplinary research from health communication and behavioral sciences into LLM training and evaluation protocols to enhance empathy, cultural competence, and patient-centeredness in model responses. Exploiting the bridge between AI and study of human communication will directly address gaps in model empathy and contextual understanding critical for clinical adoption."
