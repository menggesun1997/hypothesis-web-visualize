    "Problem_Statement": "Current performance replicability assessments overlook diversity in user interaction contexts and psychological factors influencing perceived model quality, limiting external validity across populations.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap linking psychological and biomedical constructs to LLM evaluation, specifically leveraging analogies from 'positive/negative affect' and user contextual variability to personalize evaluation metrics enhancing deployment relevance.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a Personalized Evaluation Framework (PEF) that models user affective states and contextual features as latent variables influencing model output quality.

        "title": "Personalized Evaluation Metrics Enhanced by Multimodal Affective Neuroscience and Precision Mental Health Frameworks for NLP Models",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current NLP model evaluation metrics primarily rely on aggregate performance measures that inadequately capture the diversity of user interaction contexts and the multifaceted psychological factors influencing perceived model quality. While personalization informed by affective states holds promise, existing work seldom substantiates the scale or consistency of affective influences across diverse populations or reliably integrates objective biosignals. This under-explored premise limits the external validity and deployment relevance of evaluation frameworks, particularly for sensitive applications such as mental health support. Robust validation is required to confirm that incorporating affective neuroscience constructs, supported by multimodal user data (including gaze-based and physiological signals), materially enhances evaluation metrics beyond standard aggregate benchmarks and constructs stable, interpretable personalized scores aligned with user satisfaction.",
        "Motivation": "To bridge the critical external gap linking psychological and biomedical constructs with NLP evaluation, we propose a novel framework that rigorously substantiates and operationalizes affective neuroscientific insights into personalized evaluation metrics. By integrating gaze-based interaction data and precision mental health frameworks, our approach distinguishes itself from prior work constrained to self-report or demographic proxies, offering objective, fine-grained biosignal modalities to robustly capture user affect and cognitive states. This interdisciplinarity not only deepens theoretical grounding but enhances practical applicability, especially in domains where cognitive and emotional states critically shape user experience (e.g., conversational agents for mental health). The resulting Personalized Evaluation Framework (PEF+) aspires to deliver adaptive, interpretable, and clinically meaningful metrics that reflect nuanced quality perceptions, surpassing existing metrics' limitations while opening paths for precision-driven NLP deployment.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose the Personalized Evaluation Framework Plus (PEF+), a multimodal, biologically inspired system that models user affect, cognitive states, and contextual features as latent variables influencing perceived NLP model quality. PEF+ leverages multi-source data: (1) linguistic output evaluations, (2) self-reported affective states, (3) objective biosignal proxies including gaze-tracking data capturing user attention and cognitive load, and (4) precision mental health profiles capturing clinically relevant psychological constructs. These modalities collectively inform a latent factor model employing variational inference to disentangle affective and cognitive influences on quality perception robustly. PEF+ adapts standard metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, accuracy) via learned personalized weighting functions, grounded on co-regulation principles from biology that model dynamic interaction between user state and model output. Crucially, integrating biosignals substantiates latent affect variables, enhancing robustness beyond subjective measures. The method also incorporates clinically informed subpopulations to tailor metric adaptations for mental health-relevant NLP applications, thus expanding impact.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Conduct a thorough literature and pilot study synthesis to quantify the influence of affective and cognitive states on NLP evaluation perceptions across diverse populations, establishing foundational evidence for personalization benefits.\n2. Collect a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising NLP task outputs, self-reported affective states, demographics, clinical mental health assessments, gaze-tracking data, and physiological biosignals (e.g., heart rate variability) during user interactions with NLP models.\n3. Develop and train a flexible latent factor model, such as a variational autoencoder, to disentangle the joint effects of user affect, cognition, and context on perceived quality ratings.\n4. Define and validate adaptive personalized evaluation metrics by weighting traditional performance metrics with inferred latent user states, ensuring interpretability and stability.\n5. Employ rigorous validation protocols using stable ground-truth satisfaction measures, including longitudinal user feedback and standardized mental health questionnaires, to benchmark personalized metrics.\n6. Demonstrate framework effectiveness and generalizability across general and mental health-focused NLP tasks by comparing correlation improvements versus standard metrics.\n7. Include contingency evaluation criteria and fallback analyses for cases with neutral or inconsistent affective impacts, exploring group-based or biosignal-enhanced personalization strategies as alternatives.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Language generation outputs from a conversational agent evaluated by users across varied affective and clinical profiles—including individuals with anxiety and depression, monitored via gaze-tracking and heart rate variability.\nExpected Output: Personalized evaluation scores dynamically reflecting each user's nuanced cognitive-emotional state and clinical background, showing stronger correlation with user satisfaction and mental health outcomes compared to aggregate metrics, and differing significantly between distinct affective states (e.g., heightened vigilance vs relaxed attention).",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If affective contextualization via biosignals and clinical profiles yields weak or inconsistent correlations, pivot to (1) clustering users into representative subgroups defined by biosignal and behavioral proxies to apply group-specific adjusted metrics; (2) incorporating additional biosignal modalities or more granular clinical features to enrich context modeling; (3) employing semi-supervised approaches that leverage partial affective signals combined with high-quality aggregate metrics; or (4) focusing application scope on domains where affective personalization shows robust gains (e.g., mental health-focused NLP), thereby refining impact while mitigating risks of overly diffuse modeling efforts."

          "feedback_content": "The foundational assumption that personalized affective states and contextual variability significantly alter perceived NLP model quality is plausible but under-explored and could be overly optimistic. The proposal should provide more grounding evidence or preliminary data supporting the scale and consistency of affective influences on evaluation metrics. Otherwise, the framework risks modeling noise or spurious correlations rather than meaningful latent factors. Explicitly clarifying and justifying why psychological and biomedical constructs materially improve evaluation beyond existing aggregate metrics is crucial for soundness, especially given competing literature that often treats such factors as secondary or too subjective for rigorous metrics development. Including a literature synthesis or pilot findings examining affective state impact on user quality perception will strengthen this core assumption in the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections to reduce risk of invalid premise issues or misaligned effort focus. This step is a prerequisite for the complex modeling approach proposed and will improve confidence in downstream method design choices and experiment interpretation.  \n\nIn short, validate and more concretely justify the central assumption that personalization tied to affective neuroscience benefits NLP evaluation metrics substantially to establish soundness at the conceptual level, which currently appears somewhat speculative and under-evidenced in the submission context.  \n\nTarget Sections: Problem_Statement, Proposed_Method."

          "feedback_content": "While the step-by-step experimental plan is logically ordered, it lacks detailed feasibility considerations regarding (a) quality and availability of sufficiently rich multimodal affective/contextual user data, (b) practical challenges in approximate user affect detection especially under real deployment conditions, and (c) validation of personalized metrics against stable ground-truth satisfaction measures. For example, collecting high-quality simultaneous affective signals, demographics, and linguistic output metrics with enough scale and diversity to support latent factor modeling (e.g., VAE) is non-trivial. The plan should explicitly address strategies for obtaining or simulating realistic and representative user contexts with known affective states, and define robust user satisfaction measurement protocols that can validly benchmark personalized metrics. It is also advisable to include contingency approaches or evaluation criteria for cases where affect-based personalization yields marginal or inconclusive results (e.g., neutral or inconsistent impact on correlation improvements). Detailing these aspects will improve the practicality and scientific rigor of the experimentation roadmap and reduce risks of inconclusive outcomes or overly optimistic assumptions about available data and validation processes.  \n\nEnhancing feasibility clarity especially around data collection, annotation, and validation strategies for user affect and contextual modeling is key.  \n\nTarget Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan."

          "feedback_content": "Given that the novelty is labeled NOV-COMPETITIVE and based on affective neuroscience integration with NLP evaluation, incorporating concepts like gaze-based interaction and precision mental health could distinctly elevate novelty and impact. Specifically, integrating gaze-tracking data as an objective, biosignal-based proxy of cognitive and affective user states could substantiate the latent affect variables and enhance personalization robustness beyond self-reports or demographic proxies. This aligns well with the fallback plan's mention of biosignal proxies and could be expanded upfront. Additionally, leveraging precision mental health frameworks can help tailor evaluation metrics not only to transient moods but also to clinically relevant psychological profiles, thus broadening impact to healthcare NLP applications—such as conversational agents for mental health support, where personalized evaluation metrics are critical. Incorporating such interdisciplinary, biosignal-based, and clinically grounded user-state data modalities can improve differentiation from existing work, deepen impact across NLP model deployment domains, and demonstrate stronger links to biomedical constructs. This integration should be a clear design objective and may also motivate more diverse and rigorous experimental designs, potentially increasing competitiveness in premier conferences.  \n\nTarget Sections: Proposed_Method, Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan."
