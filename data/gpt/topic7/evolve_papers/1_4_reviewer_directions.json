    "title": "Behavioral Science-Informed LLM Response Personalization Module",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs frequently deliver uniform, non-personalized responses lacking consideration of individual patient behavioral drivers or communication preferences, limiting clinical utility and patient engagement.",
    "Motivation": "This idea targets the external gap in integrating health communication and behavioral science with LLM training (Critical Gap), advancing Innovation Opportunity 3 by customizing responses that respect patient psychological and cultural contexts for improved adoption.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a personalization module that conditions LLM outputs on behavioral profiles derived via brief patient interaction inputs or EHR meta-data, embedding behavioral change theories and communication style adaptations. The system dynamically modifies tone, detail level, and motivational framing, generating responses optimized for adherence and understanding.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Annotate clinical dialogues with behavioral profile categories (e.g., stages of change, health literacy).\n(2) Train LLMs with conditional generation architecture integrating behavioral inputs.\n(3) Conduct controlled trials with simulated patient scenarios.\n(4) Evaluate personalization effectiveness via comprehension, engagement, and likelihood of behavior change metrics.\n(5) Compare to non-personalized LLM outputs.\n(6) Collect feedback from behavioral scientists and clinicians.\n(7) Iterate model refinements based on findings.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Patient profile indicating low health literacy and high anxiety.\nQuery: \"How do I manage my diabetes?\"\nExpected Output: Simple, empathetic, actionable advice acknowledging patient concerns, avoiding jargon, and motivating small achievable steps.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If behavioral profile extraction is low quality, fallback to more general patient segmentation or allow manual profile input. If personalization fails to improve engagement, investigate alternative behavioral theory embeddings or model architectures."

          "feedback_content": "While the step-by-step experiment plan is systematic, it risks oversimplifying the complexity of behavioral profile annotation and its integration with LLMs. Annotating clinical dialogues with behavioral categories such as stages of change or health literacy requires expert consensus and substantial inter-rater reliability assessment, which is not detailed. Moreover, the plan lacks specificity on how to reliably extract or infer behavioral profiles from brief patient inputs or EHR meta-data, which is critical for personalization validity and repeatability. The controlled trial phase should also explicitly describe patient diversity, sample size, and statistical power considerations to ensure generalizable results. Incorporating iterative annotation and pilot testing phases prior to full model training would strengthen feasibility and reduce downstream risks. Please augment the experiment plan with detailed methodology for behavioral profile extraction, annotation validation, and rigorous trial design with clear success criteria for personalization effectiveness evaluation, beyond engagement metrics alone to include clinical or behavioral outcome proxies where possible. This addresses feasibility by anchoring the ambitious personalization in rigorous, replicable experimental steps that account for domain complexities and variability in real-world clinical communication contexts.

          "feedback_content": "Given the NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty rating and the rich context of linked concepts, integrating multi-armed bandit algorithms could significantly enhance personalization adaptivity and novelty. Specifically, the system could dynamically learn optimal communication styles or motivational framings for different behavioral profiles through online bandit-based exploration-exploitation methods during simulated or real patient interactions. This would allow the LLM response personalization module not only to condition on static behavioral inputs but also to continually optimize messaging strategies based on patient engagement and outcome feedback. Furthermore, embedding semantic differential scales into patient profiling could offer nuanced, quantifiable behavioral attributes guiding fine-grained adaptation. As for impact, applying this module beyond diabetes education to other domains like tobacco control or mental health practice can demonstrate broader utility and facilitate cross-disease transfer learning. Recasting the idea as a continuously learning, multi-domain behavioral personalization system using reinforcement learning principles would elevate originality and practical value, positioning it competitively at the intersection of behavioral science, adaptive machine learning, and clinical NLP.
