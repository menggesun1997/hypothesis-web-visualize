        "title": "Socio-Technical Workflow Aware LLM Evaluation Simulator with Empirical Grounding and Feasibility-Driven Validation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) in clinical contexts often overlook the complex socio-technical factors shaping clinician-AI interactions, such as trust dynamics, iterative decision-making, and workflow variability. While simulating these interactions offers promise for safer AI deployment assessments, existing approaches risk oversimplification without rigorous empirical grounding in actual clinician behavior patterns and workflow nuances. This gap threatens the validity and applicability of simulation outcomes, underscoring the need for a framework that explicitly incorporates validated behavioral models and well-justified simulation assumptions to faithfully capture real-world clinical socio-technical phenomena.",
        "Motivation": "This research addresses a critical internal gap in LLM evaluation by integrating socio-technical workflow simulations with empirically informed clinician behavior models. By doing so, it provides a more credible and context-sensitive assessment of LLM outputs within clinical decision workflows—particularly focusing on trust evolution, error correction, and decision overrides—increasing the reliability of evaluation results. The approach stands to enrich the research landscape by bridging clinical workflow ethnographies, human factors modeling, and LLM error dynamics, thereby facilitating safer AI deployment guidelines supported by transparent, validated simulation methodologies.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose to develop a socio-technical workflow evaluation simulator grounded in empirical clinician behavior and clinical workflow data. The method involves: (1) deriving interaction models through a mixed approach combining literature synthesis from clinical decision-making studies, ethnographic workflow analyses, and preliminary expert elicitation workshops to parameterize clinician trust dynamics, override tendencies, and error correction pathways; (2) implementing these models within a modular workflow simulator that captures typical clinician-AI interaction sequences, including iteration loops and trust calibration; (3) integrating LLM output variants with controlled error injection profiles; (4) embedding explicit uncertainty and behavioral variability modeling to reflect nuances such as trust evolution over repeated AI interactions; (5) applying systematic validation steps including comparison with anonymized clinical workflow logs and targeted human-in-the-loop sessions designed to assess simulation fidelity; and (6) documenting and justifying all model assumptions transparently to facilitate community critique and extension. This foundation prioritizes behavioral realism and methodological rigor to produce credible socio-technical LLM evaluations.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "(1) Conduct comprehensive literature review to identify key clinician-AI interaction behaviors and socio-technical factors from clinical informatics, human factors, and cognitive psychology domains.\n(2) Organize expert elicitation workshops with practicing clinicians to refine behavioral model parameters relating to trust, overrides, and error mitigation.\n(3) Collect or gain access to anonymized clinical workflow datasets and AI interaction logs through institutional collaborations, ensuring privacy compliance.\n(4) Develop modular simulation architecture implementing empirically grounded models, allowing parameter configuration.\n(5) Generate LLM output variants with controlled, characterized error profiles for simulation inputs.\n(6) Run simulations to observe clinician decision outcomes, trust dynamics, and error correction pathways.\n(7) Validate simulation outputs against real-world clinical data metrics, perform human-in-the-loop studies with clinicians to compare simulated vs. actual decision behaviors.\n(8) Define clear milestone criteria for adopting simplified canonical workflow sequences if data limitations arise, including fallback to proxy behavioral models drawn from literature and expert input.\n(9) Iteratively refine simulation fidelity based on validation outcomes.\n(10) Produce recommendations and guidelines for safer clinical AI deployment drawing from validated simulation insights.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Simulated clinical workflow in which the LLM provides conflicting diagnosis suggestions, varying error types and confidence presentations.\nExpected Output: Simulator reflects how clinicians update trust based on repeated conflicting outputs, demonstrate override behaviors, and engage in error mitigation, with resultant diagnostic accuracy quantified. Human-in-the-loop comparisons show statistical alignment between simulated and observed clinician reactions to similar AI output inconsistencies, confirming model plausibility.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Recognizing challenges in obtaining rich real-world workflow datasets and precise behavioral parameters, the fallback strategy involves: (1) focusing initially on canonical clinical workflow sequences with well-characterized interactions drawn from publicly available protocols;\n(2) employing proxy behavioral models distilled from systematic literature review and expert elicitation rather than direct patient data;\n(3) designing incremental simulation modules which progressively incorporate complexity subject to data availability;\n(4) using simulated datasets and synthetic interaction traces to test core hypotheses before scaling up to real-world validation;\n(5) maintaining transparency on limitations and assumptions to guide future improvements and community-driven refinements."

          "feedback_content": "The proposal assumes that simulating clinician-AI workflows with configurable parameters and error injection accurately captures the real-world interplay of socio-technical factors, trust dynamics, and iterative decision-making. However, this core assumption risks oversimplification without detailed empirical grounding and a clear model of clinician behavior nuances. To strengthen soundness, explicitly justify the fidelity of behavioral models or provide preliminary validation steps and sources that confirm the assumptions about interaction patterns, trust evolution, and error correction pathways within clinical settings. This is essential because socio-technical interactions are complex, variable by context, and influenced by factors that might not be fully capturable in simulation alone, which could limit the reliability of findings if left unexamined or poorly validated. This critique targets the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections for clearer foundational grounding and validation planning to ensure the simulation’s premise is robust and credible in representing real clinical workflows and decision contexts.\" ,\"target_section\":\"Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method\"},{\"feedback_code\":\"FEA-EXPERIMENT\",\"feedback_content\":\"The proposed step-by-step experiment plan is comprehensive but ambitious, particularly the later stages involving validation against real-world workflow data and modeling clinician decisions influenced by AI outputs. Practical feasibility may be hindered by challenges in obtaining sufficiently rich and representative real-world clinical workflow datasets and in accurately modeling human behavioral responses (e.g., trust modification, error mitigation). To improve feasibility, the plan should explicitly detail strategies for data access, human subject study designs or expert elicitation protocols, and scalable proxy modeling methods. Also, clarifying fallback operationalization—such as the criteria for choosing canonical workflows or proxy models—and specifying incremental milestones to demonstrate partial outcomes would make the plan more actionable and realistic. Feedback targets the Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan section, urging refinement to enhance practical feasibility and contingency planning for the most challenging experimental stages.\" ,\"target_section\":\"Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan\"}]}  The primary focus is on foundational soundness of socio-technical assumptions and practical feasibility of the experimental validation approach, which are critical prerequisites for this hybrid novelty approach to yield meaningful, trustworthy contributions. Addressing these will substantially strengthen the work’s internal foundations and readiness for impactful application.  There are no globally linked concepts provided, so no suggestion for global integration is added.  This targeted feedback supports a high-leverage path forward for refining and maturing the research idea effectively.  "
