    "title": "Adaptive Interactive Fairness Dashboard for LLM Deployment",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM deployments lack interactive systems that enable real-time user-driven fairness supervision, resulting in persistent biases and instabilities during live use.",
    "Motivation": "This idea directly addresses the internal gap of minimal user supervision and the under-explored area of embedding human-computer interaction to enable continuous bias correction during LLM operation. It leverages the 'minimal user supervision' bridge in the landscape.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop an Adaptive Interactive Fairness Dashboard (AIFD) integrating advanced visualization, explainability modules (XAI), and real-time user feedback mechanisms. The system allows users to identify bias patterns in LLM outputs, provide corrective annotations, and propagate adjustments to fine-tune the model deployment dynamically. It includes a feedback loop where the LLM adapts its biases based on supervised annotations with minimal user effort, using active learning protocols.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Utilize benchmark datasets with known bias attributes (e.g., bias in gender/names) and deploy an LLM (like GPT-based) in a controlled environment. 2) Develop the AIFD interface with modules for bias detection visualization and user annotation. 3) Implement active learning to update the model on user feedback. 4) Baseline without user interaction vs. system with AIFD enabled. 5) Evaluate fairness metrics (e.g., Equality of Opportunity, demographic parity) and output stability over deployment cycles.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A generated text with gender stereotypes about job roles. Expected output: The dashboard highlights biased phrases, user flags them, and the model adjusts to generate unbiased alternatives in subsequent outputs.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If real-time adaptation proves unstable, fallback to batch-mode corrections aggregated from user feedback before model updates. Employ simulated user feedback to augment sparse supervision data."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that real-time user-driven fairness supervision can dynamically and reliably reduce bias during live LLM deployment needs stronger justification. There are known challenges in stability and latency when updating large language models on-the-fly, and the proposal does not sufficiently clarify how minimal user input will be efficiently and effectively translated into model updates without compromising generation quality or responsiveness. Clarifying these assumptions with evidence from preliminary studies or literature would improve soundness of the problem framing and method design, ensuring the real-time adaptation premise is feasible and robust in practice without unintended negative effects like instability or degraded accuracy over time, especially given minimal user effort constraints and active learning complexity in high-dimensional LLM spaces. Please explicitly address potential limitations and mitigation strategies related to this assumption in the Proposed_Method section to enhance confidence in the foundational premise of the solution design and viability within live deployment contexts with complex social bias dynamics and user feedback variability . This is critical to confirm the method's soundness and practical impact potential before full-scale experimentation is undertaken. Recommendations include citing relevant prior work or providing preliminary validation insights showing effectiveness and stability of iterative bias correction driven by minimal human annotations integrated into LLM fine-tuning or output filtering pipelines in real-time or near-real-time scenarios.  \n\n---\n\nThis point is the most fundamental for ensuring the method can fulfill its intended purpose without impractical overhead or degradation, and clarifying it would greatly strengthen the proposal's validity and potential for successful realization and adoption in real LTC system deployments or fairness tools in NLP applications widely affected by bias risks, such as clinical decision support or social NLP platforms.  \n\nPlease provide a detailed assessment of these underlying assumptions to help reviewers and stakeholders gauge feasibility and reliability of the adaptive fairness supervision approach embedded within the proposed AIFD system design, moving beyond high-level conceptual appeal toward a well-grounded actionable method framework with explicit risk and mitigation considerations alongside clear delineation of user-system interactions and system adaptation dynamics under realistic usage conditions as next priority step prior to or concurrently with experimental development phases. This will materially reduce risk of wasted resource investment in unstable or overly optimistic approaches and refine the method into a more mature, implementable blueprint for impactful research outcomes and deployment readiness at top-tier venues like ACL or NeurIPS where technical depth and methodological rigor are paramount.  \n\nTarget Section: Proposed_Method"

          "feedback_content": "While the step-by-step experiment plan covers essential components like bias detection visualization, user annotation, active learning, and fairness metric evaluation, it lacks concrete details on key feasibility aspects critical for scientific rigor and practical realization:  \n\n- How will user feedback be collected and simulated realistically, particularly accounting for noise, bias, or inconsistency in annotations? \n- What is the model update frequency and computational budget for real-time adaptation or batch fallback, considering latency and scalability constraints?\n- How will the system isolate causal impact of user corrections versus model drift or environment changes on fairness metrics and output stability over deployment cycles?\n- Are there controlled baselines including existing fairness intervention methods or ablations to quantify the unique contribution of the interactive dashboard?\n\nThe plan would benefit from integrating systematic evaluation protocols for user interactions (e.g., simulated vs. actual users), stability analysis under different feedback volumes and qualities, and ablation studies addressing components such as explainability modules versus feedback loops. Also, specifying quantitative criteria for success (e.g., minimum fairness improvement thresholds, stability variance bounds) and fallbacks if active learning inadequately converges or destabilizes outputs will enhance feasibility and impact clarity.  \n\nIncorporating these points will strengthen scientific soundness, reproducibility, and practical confidence, thereby making the experimental validation robust enough to support strong claims at premier conference levels. Consider expanding the Experiment_Plan section with explicit mention of these protocols and experimental controls as the immediate next step to solidify feasibility and methodological rigor of the proposal."
