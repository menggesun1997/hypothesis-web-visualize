        "title": "CognitiveFair: Embedding Prefrontal Cortex-Inspired Mechanisms for Stable Fairness in LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLMs lack stable fairness across deployment contexts due to missing integration of cognitive mechanisms that humans use to process fairness and reduce bias. This results in performance-fairness tradeoffs that vary unpredictably when models encounter real-world data shifts.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of bridging model performance and stable fairness by leveraging the hidden bridge between 'language model' and 'human-level performance' through cognitive psychology lenses, specifically mimicking prefrontal cortex executive functions to modulate bias dynamically.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design a novel attention-modulation architecture module inspired by prefrontal cortex inhibitory control to regulate bias signals in the model's internal representations. This module dynamically suppresses learned biases when generating responses, conditioned on context fairness cues detected via multimodal inputs. Integrate this with a multilayer fairness feedback loop informed by cognitive conflict detection models, creating a continuous fairness regulation system embedded in the LLM's forward pass.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect datasets that include multimodal inputs (text+image) with known bias attributes. 2. Implement a standard transformer LLM baseline (e.g., GPT variant). 3. Develop the cognitive-inspired inhibitory control module and integrate it. 4. Evaluate bias stability on in-distribution and out-of-distribution prompts using fairness metrics (equalized odds, subgroup calibration) over time. 5. Compare against standard fine-tuning bias mitigation baselines. 6. Analyze internal activations for interpretability, relating to cognitive conflict signals.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A news snippet describing gender roles with subtle stereotypical language. Expected output: A balanced, non-stereotypical paraphrase that maintains the factual content without reinforcing bias, validated by subgroup fairness metrics showing low disparity.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic inhibitory control is ineffective, fallback to a hybrid approach where static bias filters trained via cognitive conflict signals post-process LLM outputs. Alternatively, use human-in-the-loop feedback to tune control thresholds iteratively."

        "title": "PsyFairEval: Psychologically Grounded Fairness Metrics for Human-Level LLM Evaluation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current fairness evaluation metrics for LLMs focus on statistical parity or benchmark scores, failing to capture nuanced human cognitive responses to biased or unfair outputs, limiting true human-model alignment.",
        "Motivation": "Directly addresses Opportunity 1 by integrating cognitive psychology constructs into evaluation methodology, filling the gap in stable fairness detection by creating metrics that reflect human cognitive fairness perceptions beyond benchmark-centric measures.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop new fairness evaluation metrics grounded in cognitive load theory and moral judgment frameworks. This includes measuring cognitive dissonance induced by biased model outputs using user attention tracking, response latency, and sentiment analysis on human feedback. Incorporate these metrics into a composite psychological fairness score for LLM outputs.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Recruit human participants from diverse groups and collect responses to LLM outputs with varying bias levels. 2. Track physiological and behavioral indicators (eye-tracking, response time). 3. Correlate these with existing statistical fairness metrics and build predictive models mapping outputs to cognitive fairness scores. 4. Validate metrics on unseen tasks and demographic groups. 5. Release a benchmarking suite for psychological fairness evaluation.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM-generated responses to politically sensitive questions. Human evaluators show increased cognitive dissonance indicators for biased outputs, reflected by longer response times and negative sentiment, enabling calibration of the new fairness score.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If physiological measures are noisy, rely on crowd-sourced qualitative fairness ratings combined with NLP sentiment analysis as proxy signals. Alternatively, simplify metrics to textual features correlated with human bias perceptions."

        "title": "Explain2Fair: Cognitive-Science-Driven Post Hoc XAI for Bias Stability Verification",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing XAI techniques do not adequately facilitate transparency for underrepresented stakeholders to verify fairness and bias stability in LLM decisions, limiting trust and regulatory acceptance.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses Opportunity 2 by synthesizing post-hoc XAI methods with cognitive and behavioral science insights to create interpretable explanations that align with human reasoning patterns, making fairness verification more accessible and actionable.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Create an explanation framework that maps LLM decision pathways onto cognitive reasoning schemas (e.g., analogical reasoning, hypothesis testing) using concept attribution and counterfactual generation tailored to stakeholder cognitive profiles. Implement multimodal explanation interfaces (textual, visual) that adapt explanation complexity dynamically.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select representative LLM tasks with fairness concerns. 2. Develop concept attribution layers aligned with cognitive task models. 3. Conduct user studies with diverse stakeholders to calibrate explanation modalities and complexity. 4. Measure fairness verification accuracy and trust metrics pre/post explanation. 5. Compare with baseline XAI tools in terms of stakeholder comprehension and engagement.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM decision on loan approval explanation for a minority applicant. Output: A layered explanation visually highlighting key evidence, counterfactual scenarios showing bias impact, and a simplified summary matching user cognitive style, increasing stakeholder trust in fairness assessment.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If user adaptation is challenging, fix explanation complexity levels optimized by iterative feedback. If cognitive schema mapping is inconclusive, use rule-based justification and contrastive explanations as a simpler surrogate."

        "title": "RegulAlign: Lifecycle Framework Unifying Fairness, Regulation, and Socio-Cognitive Evaluation for LLM Deployment",
        "Problem_Statement": "No unified framework exists that spans technical fairness, regulatory compliance, and human-centric socio-cognitive evaluation to ensure bias-stable and trustworthy LLM deployments in real-world scenarios.",
        "Motivation": "Confronts Opportunity 3 by merging EU AI Act regulatory insights with model interpretability and cognitive-behavioral science to close deployment gaps, enabling replicable and accountable LLM use in practice.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design an end-to-end deployment lifecycle pipeline incorporating modular components: (a) fairness-aware model training, (b) regulatory compliance audits using formal verification tools aligned with legal requirements, (c) socio-cognitive user studies and feedback loops measuring trust and perceived fairness. Integrate monitoring dashboards for continuous bias and compliance checks informed by real-time user interactions and cognitive metrics.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Define regulatory constraints from EU AI Act rulebooks. 2. Implement fairness-aware training on LLM models for target domains. 3. Build formal verification tools for compliance checking. 4. Conduct longitudinal user studies evaluating trust with cognitive load and feedback mechanisms. 5. Pilot the lifecycle framework in controlled deployment simulations. 6. Measure effectiveness via fairness metrics, compliance scores, and user trust indices.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Deployment of an LLM-powered hiring assistant in an EU country. Expected outcome: sustained fairness metrics within regulatory bounds, documented compliance certification, and high user trust validated through cognitive-behavioral assessments.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full integration is complex, modularize into separate pipelines with interoperability interfaces supporting gradual adoption. Employ synthetic user simulations to test socio-cognitive components before real-world deployment."

        "title": "NeuroFairGen: Brain-Inspired Generative Models for Bias-Resilient Multimodal LLM Outputs",
        "Problem_Statement": "Generative LLM outputs often contain latent biases that degrade fairness, especially under multimodal scenarios, without mechanisms to ensure bias-resilient generation informed by human cognitive constraints.",
        "Motivation": "Extends hidden interdisciplinary opportunities connecting brain-inspired cognitive control mechanisms with multimodal LLM generation to produce inherently fairer outputs resilient to distributional shifts and unseen biases, addressing the internal gap of stable fairness in deployment.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a generative LLM architecture augmented with a neuromodulatory-inspired control layer simulating dopaminergic reward signals modulating bias expression dynamically. This layer influences multimodal fusion weights and output decoding to avoid biased content generation, informed by continuous cognitive fairness feedback vectors computed from human-like conflict monitoring modules.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Collect multimodal datasets containing fairness annotations. 2. Implement base multimodal transformer LLM model. 3. Add neuromodulatory control layer with reinforcement signals trained on bias detection feedback. 4. Conduct generation tasks with in/out-of-domain data. 5. Evaluate bias prevalence, content fidelity, and cognitive fairness indices. 6. Conduct human evaluations for perceived fairness and fluency.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Multimodal query combining images and text with stereotypical gender roles. Output: Generated response consciously avoiding biased terms and stereotypes, validated by lower bias scores and positive human fairness ratings.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If neuromodulatory control is unstable, train using adversarial bias discriminators and reinforce generation policies by feedback from human evaluators or surrogate cognitive models."
