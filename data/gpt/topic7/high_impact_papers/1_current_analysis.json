For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'The Content Analysis Guidebook', 'abstract': 'Content analysis is one of the most important but complex research methodologies in the social sciences.

The present study aims to leverage this technology to perform automated essay scoring (AES) and evaluate its reliability and accuracy. Specifically, we utilized the GPT-3 text-davinci-003 model to automatically score all 12,100 essays contained in the ETS Corpus of Non-Native Written English (TOEFL11) and compared these scores to benchmark levels. The study also explored the extent to which linguistic features influence AES with GPT. The results showed that AES using GPT has a certain level of accuracy and reliability and could provide valuable support for human evaluations. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that utilizing linguistic features could enhance the accuracy of the scoring. These findings suggest that AI language models, such as ChatGPT, can be effectively utilized as AES tools, potentially revolutionizing methods of writing evaluation and feedback in both research and practice. The paper concludes by discussing the practical implications of using GPT for AES and exploring prospective future considerations.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'A Metaverse: Taxonomy, Components, Applications, and Open Challenges', 'abstract': 'Unlike previous studies on the Metaverse based on Second Life, the current Metaverse is based on the social value of Generation Z that online and offline selves are not different.

Usually, it is essential to understand the reasoning behind an AI model’s decision-making. Thus, the need for eXplainable AI (XAI) methods for improving trust in AI models has arisen. XAI has become a popular research subject within the AI field in recent years. Existing survey papers have tackled the concepts of XAI, its general terms, and post-hoc explainability methods but there have not been any reviews that have looked at the assessment methods, available tools, XAI datasets, and other related aspects. Therefore, in this comprehensive study, we provide readers with an overview of the current research and trends in this rapidly emerging area with a case study example. The study starts by explaining the background of XAI, common definitions, and summarizing recently proposed techniques in XAI for supervised machine learning. The review divides XAI techniques into four axes using a hierarchical categorization system: (i) data explainability, (ii) model explainability, (iii) post-hoc explainability, and (iv) assessment of explanations. We also introduce available evaluation metrics as well as open-source packages and datasets with future research directions. Then, the significance of explainability in terms of legal demands, user viewpoints, and application orientation is outlined, termed as XAI concerns. This paper advocates for tailoring explanation content to specific user types. An examination of XAI techniques and evaluation was conducted by looking at 410 critical articles, published between January 2016 and October 2022, in reputed journals and using a wide range of research databases as a source of information. The article is aimed at XAI researchers who are interested in making their AI models more trustworthy, as well as towards researchers from other disciplines who are looking for effective XAI methods to complete tasks with confidence while communicating meaning from data.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Building Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models on Google Cloud Platform, A Comprehensive Guide for Beginners', 'abstract': 'Take a systematic approach to understanding the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning from the ground up and how they are applied in practice.

Recent advances in computational pipelines, multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing and management tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society closer to reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in many applications. Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow, mirrored system, avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary modeling practices.

    "title": "Research Landscape Map for Assessing LLM Performance Replicability in Real-World Production Systems",
    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem tackled by this research cluster is the reliable assessment and explanation of LLMs' (Large Language Models) performance especially within real-world production environments, framed largely within the context of explainability and replicability of AI models. The Central Nodes highlight focus areas such as 'content analysis', 'complex research methodology', and 'human-level performance'—indicating the importance of rigorous analytical methodologies combined with benchmarking LLMs on real-world tasks exhibiting human-level capabilities. Thematic Islands reveal three core paradigms: (1) rigorous content analysis to understand and validate research processes, (2) evaluation of multimodal, human-level LLM performance via input/output benchmarking on academic and professional tasks, and (3) explainable AI (XAI) concerns emphasizing trustworthiness, accountability, and interpretability in AI systems. Dominant methods include Transformer-based architectures (e.g., GPT-4), post-hoc explainability techniques, alignment procedures to enhance factuality and trust, and complex content analysis methodologies drawn from social sciences to evaluate models' outputs and explainability in practice. Together, these form a framework where rigorous methodology meets state-of-the-art AI models with a strong emphasis on explainability and ethical deployment.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps identified include a lack of standardized, domain-specific evaluation metrics for real-world LLM performance replicability beyond benchmark tests, as revealed by the Bridge Nodes linking 'human-level performance' and 'text input/output' with 'field of XAI'. There is also limited understanding of how explainability methods translate into trustworthy and actionable insights for diverse user groups in production settings. Additionally, papers signal an unresolved challenge in integrating explainability seamlessly with large-scale deployment pipelines (e.g., cloud platforms), particularly concerning real-time assessments in dynamic environments. External and Novel Gaps emerge from Global Context & Hidden Bridges analysis: for example, the connection between 'content analysis' and 'human-level performance' links to cognitive science concepts like working memory, neural representations, and recall performance—disciplines largely absent from current AI replicability studies. Incorporating such human cognitive paradigms could enrich model evaluation, especially in interpretability and memorization fidelity. Similarly, bridging 'content analysis' with 'field of XAI' via healthcare and clinical decision support systems points to opportunities for domain-specific explainability metrics and trust frameworks that remain untapped in LLM production assessments. Such cross-disciplinary integration promises more robust, context-aware replicability analyses.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate cognitive neuroscience concepts (e.g., working memory and neural representation dynamics) derived from the 'content analysis' & 'human-level performance' hidden bridge with explainability frameworks in the 'field of XAI' to develop neuro-inspired interpretability metrics. This could address current limitations in evaluating LLMs’ memory fidelity and reasoning transparency in production.\n\nOpportunity 2: Leverage clinical decision support system methodologies (highlighted by the hidden bridge between 'content analysis' and 'field of XAI') to co-design domain-specific evaluation protocols and trust metrics tailored for LLM deployment in sensitive real-world applications. This enables enriched, user-centric interpretability that improves replicability and stakeholder confidence.\n\nOpportunity 3: Combine complex social science content analysis methodologies (from the first thematic island) with scalable ML deployment platforms (inferred from cloud-based model building guides) to design end-to-end pipelines that automatically analyze, explain, and validate LLM outputs in real time, supporting robust replicability monitoring in production environments. This would tackle the internal gap regarding practical assessment and explanation integration in live systems."
