    "title": "Cognitive Load-Aware Prompt Engineering Framework for Enhanced Replicability",
    "Problem_Statement": "Prompt engineering lacks systematic consideration of cognitive load and semantic capacity which impacts consistency and reproducibility of LLM outputs.",
    "Motivation": "Novel integration of cognitive psychology concepts of cognitive load and memory limitations into prompt design frameworks addresses an overlooked external gap, potentially enhancing replicability by controlling semantic complexity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a framework that quantitatively assesses cognitive load of prompts (e.g., semantic complexity, token entropy) and optimizes prompt formulations to balance informativeness and cognitive load, thus improving replicability across contexts.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Design cognitive load metrics for prompts.\n2) Collect datasets requiring multi-hop reasoning.\n3) Generate prompt variations.\n4) Evaluate replicability and performance across prompt sets.\nModels: GPT-3, instruction-tuned LLMs.\nMetrics: Replicability variance, task success rates, prompt cognitive load scores.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Complex legal question prompt with varying semantic load.\nExpected Output: Lower cognitive load prompts yield more consistent and reproducible answers across runs.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If cognitive load metrics fail to predict replicability, experiment with alternative psycholinguistic measures such as syntactic complexity or semantic ambiguity."

          "feedback_content": "The assumption that cognitive load, a psychological concept traditionally applied to human cognition, can be directly and quantitatively translated to prompt engineering for language models requires more rigorous justification. LLMs do not process information like humans, so the correlation between cognitive load metrics (e.g., semantic complexity, token entropy) and model replicability should be theoretically substantiated or preliminary empirical evidence should be provided to validate this foundational premise before full framework development proceeds. Clarify how model-based semantic capacity relates to human cognitive load theory to strengthen the core assumption underpinning the method and overall problem framing in the Proposed_Method section and Problem_Statement respectively., This ensures the initiative is grounded in sound scientific rationale and avoids potential conceptual mismatch risks."

        {
          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "While the stepwise experimental plan outlines key actions, it lacks important practical details that affect feasibility. For instance, the criteria and design process for the proposed cognitive load metrics are underspecified—how will these metrics be developed, validated, and standardized? Also, collecting datasets requiring multi-hop reasoning is reasonable but the plan should specify which datasets or benchmarks to use or how to create them. Finally, the evaluation strategy could be enhanced by describing how replicability variance will be statistically measured and controlled across prompt variations, and clarifying control conditions or baselines. Providing these specifics will strengthen confidence in the experimental plan’s reproducibility and overall practical execution."

          "feedback_code": "SUG-GLOBAL_INTEGRATION",
          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty rating of 'NOV-COMPETITIVE,' the idea’s impact and originality could be elevated by integrating concepts from 'test-retest stability' and 'personality assessment tools' from the globally-linked list. Specifically, incorporating test-retest stability paradigms can provide rigorous, quantitative benchmarks for prompt replicability over repeated trials, complementing cognitive load metrics. Additionally, exploring analogies with personality-like traits or personality frameworks to characterize prompt styles or model response variability could add a novel psychological dimension to the framework. Such interdisciplinary integration may deepen insights into prompt engineering dynamics and broaden the work's appeal and impact within NLP and cognitive science communities."
