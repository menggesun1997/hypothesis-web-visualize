          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes using aligned attention mapping and causal attribution tailored for clinical semantics to integrate explainability across text and imaging outputs. However, the mechanism for how alignment and causal attribution will be operationalized and validated across these heterogeneous modalities is not clearly explained. More clarity is needed on the technical approach to achieve cross-modal alignment with causal interpretability, including architectures, alignment strategies, and how clinical semantics guide these mechanisms. This clarity is critical for assessing soundness and reproducibility of the method and should be detailed before advancing further in experiments or deployment plans to ensure the planning is grounded in a robust technical framework that addresses cross-modal explainability effectively and uniquely in clinical contexts, rather than relying on generic attention mappings or superficial alignment approaches that may lack clinical fidelity or interpretability validity in real-world multi-modal medical data contexts, which have complex semantics and varying data structures across text and images. Providing a more concrete and detailed mechanism would reduce risks of failure and improve understanding of novelty beyond competitive literature in multimodal LLM explanation paradigms in medicine. This should precede or be integrated tightly with the Experiment_Plan stages 2 and 3 to guide implementation and evaluation choices meaningfully and pragmatically, ensuring clinical relevance and reliability rather than generic adaptation of standard attention or causal approaches without domain-specific adaptations clearly outlined and justified technically and clinically.  This refinement is mandatory to qualify as a sound technical contribution and avoid potential superficiality or overly broad assumptions of explainability integration in medical multimodal LLMs currently active in research space, to reach beyond NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty status effectively and establish trustworthiness for clinical decision support usage as claimed in the motivation section without undermining scientific soundness and mechanistic clarity before expending large resources on experimental validation or clinical interpretation collection phases.  Please provide a detailed architectural and algorithmic description of your approach to aligned attention mapping and causal attribution tailored for clinical semantics to address this gap and solidify soundness of the method proposed with modality-specific justifications and reference to existing explainability techniques adapted or extended for clinical text-image multimodal data integration explicitly to demonstrate feasibility and replicability basis beyond basic attention visualization or proxy causal correlations used in current state-of-the-art work, which will clarify your unique contributions and reliable innovation beyond established competitive baselines in this highly active research area in medical AI interpretability for multimodal LLMs.  This improvement will mitigate risks in subsequent experimental and impact phases, increasing confidence in outcomes and clinical acceptance potential, and therefore should be prioritized over advancing ungrounded experimental protocols or fallback plans prematurely without a robust mechanistic foundation first established here for your method’s explainability core component design and integration strategy aligned with clinical semantics rigor and multimodal data representation complexities inherent in medical imaging and text combined contexts, ensuring scientific rigor and clinical utility promise cohesion in your proposal’s foundational stages before extending to larger scale evaluation or replicability claims at step 7 or test case generalization assessments for trust indicators deployment readiness phases, which rely heavily on this mechanism’s soundness upfront to justify downstream experimental investments and expected impact claims sufficiently as communicated in your proposal currently in its present form.  In sum, please explicate your core method’s mechanism of cross-modal explainability integration with clinical semantic tailoring rigorously with explicit technical details before advancing to experiments or validating clinician feedback and replicability analyses to ensure method soundness ahead of feasibility and impact demonstrations, avoiding gaps that risk undermining your approach’s ability to distinctly and reliably operationalize explainability across multimodal clinical data within the highly competitive medical LLM explainability research landscape you target.  This will enable a confident, replicable, and clinically meaningful evaluation protocol basis surpassing current shortfalls in multimodal LLM explainability that identify failures often due to insufficient method mechanistic transparency or modality alignment clarity rather than lack of data or transformer engine implementation alone as currently drafted in your plan.  The ultimate goal is to have a robustly defined, clinically interpretable, replicable, and causally justified cross-modal explainability approach to produce trustworthy multimodal clinical LLM outputs as envisioned, which is currently at risk of being too vague or generic at the core.  Clarify and deepen this mechanism before proceeding further is essential for the proposal’s overall soundness and effective impact realization potential as claimed in Motivation and Test_Case_Examples sections that depend heavily on this foundational component being convincingly designed and explained upfront along with the experimental planning stages keyed to it accordingly for coherence and success likelihood in your clinical decision support application context, where explainability failures can have real-world safety implications and must be resolved within your research design at the conceptual and technical level before experimental or deployment validations.  This should be prioritized as the main revision focus before addressing other proposal elements to ensure a sound, scientifically credible, and clinically valuable contribution beyond currently saturated competitive approaches in this domain of multimodal medical LLM explainability evaluation protocols, which hinges critically on the mechanism clarity and clinical adaptation rigor upfront for trustworthiness and replicability claims to hold merit and influence in the medical AI community and practice effectively as aimed here in your project vision and title claims.  This recommended enhancement addresses the major structural weakness in your proposal that otherwise risks reducing the contribution’s significance and likelihood of successful impact and acceptance in top venues or clinical community adoption contexts by reinforcing its foundational theoretical and algorithmic basis first and foremost, enabling a clear pathway from technical method through experimental validation to clinical utility demonstrated in your study plan more faithfully and convincingly, increasing proposal coherence, reliability, novelty realization, and ultimate translational value confidently needed for this vibrant, highly competitive, and impactful area you seek to advance effectively, rather than merely incremental or superficial extensions.]  Target this feedback primarily in the 'Proposed_Method' section for the detailed method mechanism clarity and robustness enhancements requested here in this critique to allow downstream stages to be meaningfully grounded and sequenced logically in your concept development and validation road map to optimize scientific soundness and success chances of this challenging yet high-impact research objective involving explainable clinical multimodal LLM deployment."

          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screen novelty verdict as NOV-COMPETITIVE indicating that the idea is a new combination but in a highly competitive area with strong existing work on interpretability and multimodal models, I strongly recommend integrating domain knowledge structures such as knowledge graphs or concept bottleneck models into your explainability framework. Specifically, you could augment your explainability modules with clinically curated knowledge graphs representing medical entities and their relationships, allowing the evaluation protocol to assess not only alignment of attention with image regions and text tokens but also the semantic grounding and consistency of explanations with established clinical concepts and causal pathways. Similarly, concept bottleneck models could be used as surrogate interpretable modules within your multimodal LLM system to provide concept-level explanations validated against clinical ontologies for transparency and better replicability. Incorporating these globally-linked concepts would distinguish your evaluation protocol from purely data-driven, modality-centric attention or causal attribution approaches by embedding structured medical domain semantics in the explainability metrics and evaluation criteria. This would enhance scientific novelty and impact by bridging state-of-the-art multimodal explainability mechanisms with clinically meaningful, structured reasoning abstractions, addressing scarcity of annotated data by leveraging external knowledge and improving trust indicators with semantically rich explanations. Such integration would also support more robust and clinically interpretable replicability measures by grounding explanations in stable, concept-based representations directly relevant to clinical decision support tasks. This recommendation targets the overall conceptual framework and could guide refinement of both your Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan sections to incorporate knowledge graph construction or alignment, concept bottleneck model training, and corresponding metric definitions within your multimodal explainability evaluation pipeline. Doing so can elevate the work’s contribution beyond incremental combinations in the competitive space toward a novel and impactful clinical AI explainability protocol advance with demonstrated utility and interpretability leverage leveraging established clinical knowledge assets, making it more compelling for publication at top NLP or ML venues and more valuable for clinical adoption."
