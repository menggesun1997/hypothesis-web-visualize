        "title": "Neurocognitive Semantic Anchoring for LLM Replicability",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluations of LLM fine-tuning and prompt engineering lack a principled understanding of how semantic representations influence replicability, limiting robustness across domains and languages.",
        "Motivation": "Addresses the internal gap of missing evaluation frameworks for replicability and the external gap connecting encyclopedic semantic modeling with cognitive neuroscience (Hidden Bridge 1). This is novel because it synthesizes hippocampal memory function models with LLM semantic embedding stability to assess replicability.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a replicability evaluation framework integrating cognitive semantic capacity models inspired by the hippocampus with fine-tuning and prompt engineering methods. It involves quantifying semantic representation stability through a neuro-inspired architecture overlay on embeddings, tracking changes during fine-tuning or prompting to predict and measure replicability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate multilingual, multi-domain datasets with annotations on semantic concepts.\n2) Train baseline LLMs with standard fine-tuning and prompt engineering.\n3) Implement a hippocampal-inspired semantic stability metric overlay.\n4) Evaluate replicability consistency across runs and domains.\n5) Compare results with traditional performance metrics.\nModels: Multilingual BERT, GPT-3 variants.\nMetrics: Semantic stability score, replicability variance, BLEU scores.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Prompt 'Translate \"financial report\" into French contextually.'\nExpected Output: Stable semantic representation across multiple fine-tuning replicates yielding consistent French translation. Semantic stability scores remain high despite model variations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If hippocampal-inspired metrics do not correlate with replicability, fallback to alternative neurocognitive models of semantic memory (e.g., semantic networks) or unsupervised clustering of embedding shifts."

        "Problem_Statement": "Lack of standardized benchmarks assessing replicability in fine-tuning and prompt engineering impedes comparative evaluation and reproducibility in LLM research.",
        "Motivation": "Fill the internal gap on standardized replicability assessment tools while leveraging cognitive psychology insights (Hidden Bridge 1 & 2). Novel in combining educational rigor with cognitive models to define benchmark tasks and metrics focused on replicability, not just performance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design an open benchmark suite comprising tasks modeled on cognitive processes (e.g., memory retention, pattern generalization) mapped to NLP tasks. Include explicit replicability evaluation protocols, run multiple seeds/settings, and use metrics such as variance in output quality and semantic consistency informed by cognitive theory.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Define tasks aligned with cognitive functions (semantic recall, transfer learning).\n2) Collect datasets reflecting these tasks.\n3) Implement baseline fine-tuned and prompt-engineered models.\n4) Run extensive replication experiments.\n5) Provide a publicly accessible leaderboard tracking replicability statistics.\nModels: RoBERTa, T5.\nMetrics: Output variance, cognitive consistency indices.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Task: Semantic recall task where model must answer paraphrased questions consistently over multiple runs.\nInput: 'What is the capital of France?'\nExpected Output: Consistently 'Paris' with low variance across runs.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If replicability metrics are not discriminative, refine benchmarks by incorporating more cognitive dimensions and alternate reliability metrics like inter-annotator agreement from crowdsourcing."

Its novelty lies in blending health literacy-inspired practical modules with cognitive theories tailored for LLM research.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a standardized educational program combining modules on statistical rigor, experiment design, cognitive science principles related to semantic memory, and hands-on labs using open-source LLM tooling. Include pre/post assessments and replicability certification.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Survey best practices in statistics, education, and cognitive psychology.\n2) Design curriculum and interactive labs combining fine-tuning and prompt engineering.\n3) Pilot with graduate NLP researchers.\n4) Assess improvement in replicability of their experiments post-training.\n5) Iterate to optimize outcomes.\nEnvironment: Jupyter notebooks, interactive coding platforms.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Pre-training: Researcher replicates set of LLM experiments with 40% failure in reproducibility.\nPost-training: Replication success improves to 85%, demonstrating program efficacy.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If initial pilot shows marginal improvement, adapt content to be more interactive, incorporate peer-review mechanisms, or integrate cognitive load management techniques."
