    "title": "Neuro-Symbolic Memory Trace Visualizer for LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Opaque LLM internal memory dynamics lack interpretability, hampering understanding of reasoning paths and replicability in deployment.",
    "Motivation": "Incorporates cognitive neuroscience principles (working memory representations) to create a novel visualization tool that bridges hidden state trajectories with symbolic memory traces inspired by human cognition, addressing the critical gap in explainability of memory fidelity.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Construct hybrid models combining LLM hidden states with symbolic abstractions representing memory items. Visualize their interaction dynamics over time for given inputs using interactive graphs that reveal persistent memory items, interference, and forgetting patterns, facilitating expert analysis and debugging.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Extract and map hidden states to symbolic memory items.\n2. Validate the mapping using synthetic recall tasks.\n3. Develop visualization dashboards embedding temporal dynamics.\n4. Test on dialogue and narrative generation tasks requiring long-term context.\n5. Collect expert feedback on usability and insight generation.\n6. Iterate to optimize clarity and interpretability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Story generation requiring consistent character attributes.\nExpected Output: Memory trace visualization showing how attributes persist or decay across text segments with user-guided exploration capabilities.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If mapping proves unfeasible, fallback on attention heatmap evolution as proxy memory visualization. Alternatively, leverage probing classifiers for focused memory attribute extraction."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that hidden states of large language models (LLMs) can be reliably and meaningfully mapped onto symbolic memory items inspired by human cognitive neuroscience is ambitious and somewhat under-justified. While drawing parallels to working memory representations is conceptually appealing, the proposal should provide stronger theoretical or preliminary empirical evidence to support this mapping's validity. Otherwise, the fundamental premise risks being unsound due to the opaque, distributed nature of LLM internal states that may not correspond cleanly to discrete symbolic memory artifacts. Clarifying how these assumptions are grounded in existing cognitive and neural network interpretability literature would strengthen the proposal's soundness substantially. Consider including prior studies or pilot analyses that illustrate feasibility of extracting symbolic abstractions from hidden states to reduce uncertainty at the foundation of the method, or articulate clearly the limitations of this assumption if unavoidable. This focus will bolster confidence in the approach's conceptual rigor and practical viability; without it, the method’s interpretability claims remain speculative rather than well-founded in the Proposal's Proposed_Method section, specifically regarding the mapping mechanism of hidden states to symbolic memory items and their interaction dynamics over time as envisioned in the visualization framework.  \n\n**Suggestion:** Incorporate more explicit linkage to neuroscience and interpretable ML findings that justify this mapping assumption to avoid pivotal conceptual weaknesses suppressed in current narrative but critical for reviewers and downstream implementers to trust the premise and invest in replication or extension of this idea.  \n\nTarget: Proposed_Method"

        {
          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is generally well structured but lacks detail on how exactly the critical mapping between hidden states and symbolic memory items will be quantitatively validated, which is a key feasibility challenge and a potential bottleneck for the entire project. Validation on synthetic recall tasks is a good start, but the criteria, metrics, or protocols for assessing the quality, fidelity, and stability of this mapping—especially in complex, real-world scenarios such as narrative or dialogue generation—are not sufficiently specified. This omission makes it difficult to assess scientific rigor and feasibility. Moreover, it is unclear how setbacks in this mapping step will be diagnosed early in the process or how quantitative expert feedback incorporation will be systematized to iteratively refine the visualization.  \n\nThe fallback plan is a sensible contingency but should be more deeply integrated into the experimental design with clear decision checkpoints rather than as an afterthought. An improved plan should elaborate measurement methods (e.g., memory fidelity metrics, alignment scores between symbolic and hidden-state traces), specify evaluation datasets beyond toy examples, and detail how expert usability feedback will be quantitatively and qualitatively incorporated for iterative visualization refinement. Providing a more rigorous and detailed experiment plan will increase confidence in the implementation feasibility and project success likelihood.  \n\nTarget: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan"
