The uncertainty that surrounds the future is both exciting and challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise risks and maximise utilities. The large number of forecasting applications calls for a diverse set of forecasting methods to tackle real-life challenges. This article provides a non-systematic review of the theory and the practice of forecasting. We provide an overview of a wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles, and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety of real-life contexts. We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and applications. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of forecasting theory and practice. Given its encyclopedic nature, the intended mode of reading is non-linear. We offer cross-references to allow the readers to navigate through the various topics. We complement the theoretical concepts and applications covered by large lists of free or open-source software implementations and publicly-available databases.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Multilingual Denoising Pre-training for Neural Machine Translation', 'abstract': '\\n                    This paper demonstrates that multilingual denoising pre-training produces significant performance gains across a wide variety of machine translation (MT) tasks. We present mBART—a sequence-to-sequence denoising auto-encoder pre-trained on large-scale monolingual corpora in many languages using the BART objective (Lewis et al., 2019 ). mBART is the first method for pre-training a complete sequence-to-sequence model by denoising full texts in multiple languages, whereas previous approaches have focused only on the encoder, decoder, or reconstructing parts of the text. Pre-training a complete model allows it to be directly fine-tuned for supervised (both sentence-level and document-level) and unsupervised machine translation, with no task- specific modifications. We demonstrate that adding mBART initialization produces performance gains in all but the highest-resource settings, including up to 12 BLEU points for low resource MT and over 5 BLEU points for many document-level and unsupervised models. We also show that it enables transfer to language pairs with no bi-text or that were not in the pre-training corpus, and present extensive analysis of which factors contribute the most to effective pre-training.\\n                    1\\n                  '}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Handbook of Research on Educational Communications and Technology', 'abstract': 'Now in its fourth edition, the Handbook has become synonymous with excellence in providing cutting edge research on educational communications and technology to the information and communication technology community.

For the first time authors from many developing countries have an opportunity to write together with the most prominent world authorities. The editor has spent several years searching for the most reputable statisticians all over the world. International contributors are either presidents of the local statistical societies, or head of the Statistics department at the main university, or the most distinguished statisticians in their countries. b) to enable any non-statistician to obtain quick and yet comprehensive and highly understandable view on certain statistical term, method or application c) to enable all the researchers, managers and practicioners to refresh their knowledge in Statistics, especially in certain controversial fields. d) to revive interest in statistics among students, since they will see its usefulness and relevance in almost all branches of Science.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Corpus Linguistics and the Web', 'abstract': '<i>Using the Web</i> as Corpus is one of the recent challenges for corpus linguistics. This volume presents a current state-of-the-arts discussion of the topic. The articles address practical problems such as suitable linguistic search tools for accessing the www, the question of register variation, or they probe into methods for culling data from the web. The book also offers a wide range of case studies, covering morphology, syntax, lexis, as well as synchronic and diachronic variation in English. These case studies make use of the two approaches to the www in corpus linguistics – web-as-corpus and web-for-corpus-building. The case studies demonstrate that web data can provide useful additional evidence for a broad range of research questions.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Ontology Matching', 'abstract': 'Ontologies tend to be found everywhere. They are viewed as the silver bullet for many applications, such as database integration, peer-to-peer systems, e-commerce, semantic web services, or social networks. However, in open or evolving systems, such as the semantic web, different parties would, in general, adopt different ontologies. Thus, merely using ontologies, like using XML, does not reduce heterogeneity: it just raises heterogeneity problems to a higher level. Euzenat and Shvaiko’s book is devoted to ontology matching as a solution to the semantic heterogeneity problem faced by computer systems. Ontology matching aims at finding correspondences between semantically related entities of different ontologies. These correspondences may stand for equivalence as well as other relations, such as consequence, subsumption, or disjointness, between ontology entities. Many different matching solutions have been proposed so far from various viewpoints, e.g., databases, information systems, and artificial intelligence. The second edition of Ontology Matching has been thoroughly revised and updated to reflect the most recent advances in this quickly developing area, which resulted in more than 150 pages of new content. In particular, the book includes a new chapter dedicated to the methodology for performing ontology matching. It also covers emerging topics, such as data interlinking, ontology partitioning and pruning, context-based matching, matcher tuning, alignment debugging, and user involvement in matching, to mention a few. More than 100 state-of-the-art matching systems and frameworks were reviewed. With Ontology Matching, researchers and practitioners will find a reference book that presents currently available work in a uniform framework. Inparticular, the work and the techniques presented in this book can be equally applied to database schema matching, catalog integration, XML schema matching and other related problems. The objectives of the book include presenting (i) the state of the art and (ii) the latest research results in ontology matching by providing a systematic and detailed account of matching techniques and matching systems from theoretical, practical and application perspectives.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Springer Handbook of Science and Technology Indicators', 'abstract': 'This handbook presents the state of the art of quantitative methods and models to understand and assess the science and technology system.

A substantial portion of the book is dedicated to detailed descriptions and analyses of data sources, presenting both traditional and advanced approaches. It addresses the main bibliographic metrics and indexes, such as the journal impact factor and the h-index, as well as altmetric and webometric indicators and science mapping techniques on different levels of aggregation and in the context of their value for the assessment of research performance as well as theirimpact on research policy and society. It also presents and critically discusses various national research evaluation systems. Complementing the sections reflecting on the science system, the technology section includes multiple chapters that explain different aspects of patent statistics, patent classification and database search methods to retrieve patent-related information. In addition, it examines the relevance of trademarks and standards as additional technological indicators.

These foundational works highlight performance gains achieved via multilingual denoising pre-training and emphasize open-source tools and encyclopedic knowledge dissemination. Central challenges addressed include developing robust, reproducible models that generalize across languages and domains. The thematic islands reveal three dominant sub-themes: (1) comprehensive, state-of-the-art methodological frameworks and implementations; (2) the role of domain-specific education and authoritative contributions in establishing rigorous statistical and computational standards; and (3) innovations in machine translation through advanced pre-training approaches. Bridge nodes like 'branches of science' and 'world authorities' suggest interdisciplinary governance and standardization attempts bridging methodological and educational domains.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal gaps highlighted include a lack of standardized benchmarks and assessment tools specifically tailored for evaluating replicability in fine-tuning versus prompt engineering of large language models (LLMs). While foundational papers emphasize performance gains and implementation, they do not deeply engage with replicability challenges or systematic evaluation protocols. Bridge concepts imply insufficient integration between domain educational frameworks and cutting-edge model performance evaluation, indicating a gap in translating authoritative statistical rigor into practical LLM replicability assessments. Externally, global context analysis uncovers hidden bridges linking encyclopedic presentation and statistical education to cognitive psychology and memory research — highlighting overlooked opportunities such as incorporating cognitive models of semantic representation and learning processes to enhance replicability understanding. Similarly, links between statistics education and health literacy domains suggest novel frameworks for improving researcher preparedness and methodology adoption. These cross-disciplinary insights point to underexplored intersections where cognitive neuroscience and educational psychology principles can fortify the theoretical and practical bases for replicable LLM fine-tuning and prompt engineering.",
