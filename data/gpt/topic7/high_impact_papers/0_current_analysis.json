Recent advances in computational pipelines, multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing and management tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society closer to reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in many applications. Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow, mirrored system, avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent status of methodologies and techniques related to the construction of digital twins mostly from a modeling perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage of the current challenges and enabling technologies along with recommendations and reflections for various stakeholders.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'Springer Handbook of Robotics', 'abstract': 'The second edition of this handbook provides a state-of-the-art cover view on the various aspects in the rapidly developing field of robotics. Reaching for the human frontier, robotics is vigorously engaged in the growing challenges of new emerging domains. Interacting, exploring, and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly touch people and their lives. The credible prospect of practical robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics as a modern scientific discipline. The ongoing vibrant expansion and strong growth of the field during the last decade has fueled this second edition of the Springer Handbook of Robotics. The first edition of the handbook soon became a landmark in robotics publishing and won the American Association of Publishers PROSE Award for Excellence in Physical Sciences & Mathematics as well as the organization’s Award for Engineering & Technology. The second edition of the handbook, edited by two internationally renowned scientists with the support of an outstanding team of seven part editors and more than 200 authors, continues to be an authoritative reference for robotics researchers, newcomers to the field, and scholars from related disciplines. The contents have been restructured to achieve four main objectives: the enlargement of foundational topics for robotics, the enlightenment of design of various types of robotic systems, the extension of the treatment on robots moving in the environment, and the enrichment of advanced robotics applications. Further to an extensive update, fifteen new chapters have been introduced on emerging topics, and a new generation of authors have joined the handbook’s team. A novel addition to the second edition is a comprehensive collection of multimedia references to more than 700 videos, which bring valuable insight into the contents. The videos can be viewed directly augmented into the text with a smartphone or tablet using a unique and specially designed app.'}, {'paper_id': 3, 'title': 'Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology', 'abstract': 'The Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology (ESST) addresses the grand challenge for science and engineering today.

According to the author of this comprehensive analysis, it is imperative to ensure that AI is developed and applied in an appropriate legal and regulatory framework that promotes innovation and investment and, at the same time, addresses the risks associated with certain uses of AI-related technologies. Essential to understanding the relationship between policy and law, this book traces the evolution of EU policy on artificial intelligence and robotics, focusing in particular on the EU’s ethical framework for AI, which defines trust as a prerequisite for ensuring a human-centric approach. The main part of the book provides a thorough and systematic analysis of the Commission’s 2021 proposed AI Act, which establishes harmonised rules for the development, placement on the market and use of AI systems in the EU. The author painstakingly compares the Commission’s proposed AI Act with the numerous “compromise” proposals of the Council of the European Union, leading to the final version of the Council’s AI Act (general approach) and its formal adoption on 6 December 2022. The author also examines with extraordinary detail the amendments proposed by the relevant committees and political groups of the European Parliament, revealing the position the Parliament is likely to adopt in the forthcoming negotiations with the Commission and the Council on the text of the AI Act. Numerous legislative and policy documents are presented in detail, while the analysis also considers the comments made by all interested parties (e.g. the European Commission, Council of the European Union, European Parliament, governmental organisations, national competent authorities, and stakeholders/actors with different/conflicting interests, such as corporations, business and consumer associations, civil society and other non-profit organisations). In the course of its in-depth analysis, this book will provide readers with crucial insight into the reasons behind the European Institutions’ different approaches and the often contradictory interests of stakeholders. Because the policy arguments are carefully balanced and drafted with scrupulous care, this volume will establish itself as a reference resource to be consulted for years to come.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Handbook of Metaheuristics', 'abstract': '“… an excellent book if you want to learn about a number of individual metaheuristics.\" (U. Aickelin, Journal of the Operational Research Society, Issue 56, 2005, on the First Edition) The first edition of the Handbook of Metaheuristics was published in 2003 under the editorship of Fred Glover and Gary A. Kochenberger. Given the numerous developments observed in the field of metaheuristics in recent years, it appeared that the time was ripe for a second edition of the Handbook. When Glover and Kochenberger were unable to prepare this second edition, they suggested that Michel Gendreau and Jean-Yves Potvin should take over the editorship, and so this important new edition is now available. Through its 21 chapters, this second edition is designed to provide a broad coverage of the concepts, implementations and applications in this important field of optimization. Original contributors either revised or updated their work, or provided entirely new chapters. The Handbook now includes updated chapters on the best known metaheuristics, including simulated annealing, tabu search, variable neighborhood search, scatter search and path relinking, genetic algorithms, memetic algorithms, genetic programming, ant colony optimization, multi-start methods, greedy randomized adaptive search procedure, guided local search, hyper-heuristics and parallel metaheuristics.

    "current_research_landscape": "The foundational literature (Part A) predominantly revolves around advanced modeling paradigms such as digital twins—virtual replicas enabled by data and simulations—and robotics, encompassing cyber-physical intelligent systems and their development. Through the local knowledge skeleton analysis (Part B), the central focus clusters around constructing digital twins and advancing robotic applications. The core problem being tackled is enhancing the fidelity, real-time adaptability, and decision-making of intelligent systems through integrative modeling approaches. Dominant methods emphasize multidisciplinary modeling techniques, including multiphysics solvers, data integration pipelines, and advanced simulation frameworks closely tied to robotics research and state-of-the-art applications. This reflects a paradigm aiming to replicate, predict, and optimize complex physical systems virtually to bridge digital and physical realities effectively.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite the robust conceptual framework, the lack of bridge nodes (B3) within the cluster signifies weak connectivity between digital twin construction and robotics paradigms internally, indicating isolated research efforts with insufficient integration across subfields. The literature does not sufficiently address cross-validation mechanisms or replicability across different intelligent system implementations, which is critical for performance evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in academic benchmarks. Furthermore, limitations regarding real-time data assimilation, scalability, and standardization of models remain underexplored. External/Novel Gaps: Global context analysis (Part C) reveals a promising hidden bridge between 'construction of digital twins' and 'robotics research' intersecting fields such as human-computer interaction, structural health monitoring, smart sensors, and meta-learning techniques. Notably, concepts like model-agnostic meta-learning and multi-objective algorithms from civil engineering and computing are not considered within the current cluster. These cross-disciplinary connections suggest unexplored avenues for enhancing replicability and robustness of modeling frameworks by embedding adaptive, learning-based meta-heuristics and sensor-driven validation mechanisms, which could directly address local gaps in system integration and performance consistency.",
