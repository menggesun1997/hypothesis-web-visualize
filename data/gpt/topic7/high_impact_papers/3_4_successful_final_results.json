        "title": "NeuroFairGen: Multi-Agent Neuromodulatory Control within Federated Multimodal LLMs for Robust Bias-Resilient Generation",
        "Problem_Statement": "Despite advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs), latent biases persist in generated outputs, especially under diverse real-world distributional shifts. Existing fairness mitigation approaches seldom leverage explicit brain-inspired neuromodulatory control mechanisms with sufficient mechanistic clarity, nor do they adapt robustly to unseen biases arising from heterogeneous user contexts while preserving privacy.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work conceptually connects neuromodulatory cognitive control and bias mitigation, the lack of detailed computational mechanisms limits reproducibility and impact in the highly competitive fairness research landscape. By explicitly modeling dopaminergic-inspired signals through multi-agent reinforcement learning agents cooperating within a federated intelligence architecture, our approach transcends static bias correction, enabling dynamic, distributed, and privacy-preserving fairness control that adapts continuously across modalities and deployment environments. This integration opens a novel intersection of cognitive neuroscience, multi-agent systems, and federated learning, addressing internal gaps in mechanistic soundness and external gaps in scalable real-world deployment.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a novel multimodal LLM architecture augmented by a set of specialized neuromodulatory agents, each modeled as an independent reinforcement learning actor trained to detect and mitigate specific bias types (e.g., gender, racial, or cultural biases) via reward signals inspired by dopaminergic neuromodulation. Each agent computes continuous cognitive fairness feedback vectors derived from algorithmic conflict monitoring modules operationalized as differential discrepancy detectors over multimodal fusion states and output token probabilities. These agents collaboratively modulate fusion weights and output decoding distributions through learned gating mechanisms within the transformer layers, dynamically adjusting generation to suppress biased content. To enable scalable, privacy-preserving adaptation, the entire multi-agent neuromodulatory system is deployed within a federated intelligence framework, where local fairness feedback from diverse users contributes to policy updates without sharing raw data, ensuring robustness to unseen biases under real-world distributional shifts. This combination of neuroscience-inspired mechanisms, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and federated intelligence distinctly advances the state of the art by providing mechanistically explicit, adaptive, and globally generalizable fairness control for multimodal LLMs.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate and expand multimodal datasets annotated for various bias categories, emphasizing heterogeneity across domains and user demographics. 2. Develop a base multimodal transformer LLM for generation tasks. 3. Design algorithmic conflict monitoring modules that quantify cross-modal and intra-modal content discrepancies indicative of bias, and formalize continuous fairness feedback vectors computed from these signals. 4. Implement a multi-agent reinforcement learning system where each neuromodulatory agent receives fairness feedback and dopaminergic-inspired reward signals to learn bias mitigation policies influencing fusion and decoding layers. 5. Integrate multi-agent neuromodulatory control into the LLM, enabling dynamic modulation of generation via learned gating mechanisms. 6. Deploy the system within a federated learning environment simulating heterogeneous user devices providing local fairness feedback to update agent policies without raw data exchange. 7. Evaluate on in-domain and out-of-domain generation tasks measuring: bias metrics (e.g., StereoSet, FairGen scores), content fidelity, cognitive fairness indices, and human evaluations of fairness and fluency. 8. Conduct ablation studies isolating the impact of neuromodulatory agents, federated intelligence, and conflict monitoring components.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example Input: A multimodal query combining an image depicting traditionally gender-stereotyped scenes with ambiguous textual prompts prone to stereotypical interpretation. Example Output: The generated textual response dynamically avoids biased terms, reframes stereotypes, and reflects balanced associations across gender roles. Validation includes significantly reduced bias scores in automated metrics, positive human fairness ratings, and transparent attribution of modulation effects to specific neuromodulatory agents controlling different bias facets within the federated framework.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-agent neuromodulatory control proves unstable or slow to converge, fallback strategies involve incorporating centralized adversarial bias discriminators trained on aggregated representations and leveraging surrogate cognitive conflict models to enforce fairness constraints. Additionally, simulated federated environments with synthetic feedback can bootstrap policy learning. Alternative modulation techniques such as attention mask reweighting or controlled decoding constraints will be explored to maintain bias mitigation capacity while preserving generation quality."

Key aspects that need clarification include: how exactly the dopaminergic signals are modeled and computed in practice, how they dynamically adjust multimodal fusion weights and output decoding steps, and the concrete form and source of the \"continuous cognitive fairness feedback vectors.\" The proposal would benefit from detailing the computational formulations, potential architectures or layer designs, and how conflict monitoring modules operate algorithmically within the model. Ensuring these mechanistic details are explicit and backed by relevant cognitive neuroscience findings would strengthen soundness and reproducibility of the method component. Without this clarity, it is challenging to assess the underlying assumptions about cognitive control translation into model operations, which is fundamental for the proposed approach's validity and novelty in this competitive domain."

Specifically, framing the neuromodulatory control layer as a multi-agent system where distributed agents specialize in detecting and mitigating different bias types could leverage dynamics from multi-agent RL for more robust, adaptive fairness. Additionally, deploying the model within a federated learning framework would enable continuous, privacy-preserving fairness feedback from heterogeneous real-world users, addressing unseen biases under distribution shifts and enhancing real-world deployment potential. Incorporating these globally linked concepts could push the approach toward state-of-the-art, scalable systems that better generalize fairness control across contexts and modalities."
