    "title": "NeuroCognitive Memory Fidelity Metric for LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluation metrics for LLM performance replicability lack alignment with human working memory dynamics, resulting in insufficient fidelity assessment of how well LLMs store and recall information during real-world use.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap connecting 'content analysis' and 'human-level performance' with cognitive neuroscience concepts of working memory. Novelty lies in fusing neurocognitive paradigms with explainability frameworks to create new interpretability metrics that quantify LLM memory fidelity in production environments.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a neuro-inspired metric that models LLM internal state persistence similar to human working memory capacity and decay. Using state sequence analysis during inference, the method quantifies decay patterns, interference, and recall consistency, integrating this with post-hoc explainability tools to highlight memory strengths and weaknesses per input context dynamically.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Extend Transformer-based LLMs to log internal hidden state trajectories.\n2. Implement neuro-inspired fidelity metrics modeled on working memory constructs.\n3. Evaluate on datasets requiring multi-turn reasoning (e.g., conversational benchmarks).\n4. Compare with standard perplexity, BLEU, and faithfulness metrics.\n5. Test in real production-like pipelines with dynamic inputs evaluating memory drift.\n6. Conduct user studies to link metric output with perceived trust.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A multi-turn dialogue requiring recall of user preferences.\nExpected Output: Memory fidelity score that identifies decay after 3 dialogue turns, with an explanation highlighting where memory loss is detected in hidden state representations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If fidelity metrics poorly correlate with LLM performance, pivot to analyzing attention weight distribution dynamics as alternative memory proxies. Additionally, consider expanding to multi-modal memory signals or incorporating reinforcement learning feedback for calibration."

        "title": "NeuroCognitive Memory Fidelity Metric for LLMs with Educational AI Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluation metrics for LLM performance replicability inadequately capture the fidelity of information storage and recall, as they do not align quantitatively with human working memory dynamics. This results in limited insight into how large language models (LLMs) maintain context over time, particularly in real-world, multi-turn interactions such as dialogue or educational settings.",
        "Motivation": "While many existing metrics assess language model accuracy or fluency, they often overlook the temporal persistence and decay of internal state information analogous to human working memory. By deeply integrating neurocognitive paradigms with explainability frameworks, and extending this fusion into educational AI contexts such as adaptive instructional systems and automated essay evaluation, this research uniquely positions a memory fidelity metric as both a diagnostic and actionable tool. This addresses the NOV-COMPETITIVE status by articulating a rigorous, mathematically grounded, and interdisciplinary framework that bridges cognitive neuroscience, explainable AI, and human-centered educational applications—enabling enhanced trust and transparency in complex LLM deployments supporting learning and interaction.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a formally defined, neuro-inspired memory fidelity metric that models LLM internal state persistence using quantitative analogs of human working memory capacity, decay, and interference mechanisms. Specifically, we: (1) mathematically characterize working memory decay with exponential and interference-modulated functions derived from cognitive neuroscience literature; (2) employ time-series analysis on logged hidden-state trajectories during LLM inference to measure decay rates and interference patterns consistent with these models; (3) integrate these measurements into a composite fidelity score reflecting the likelihood of accurate recall over interactions; and (4) link the metric dynamically with a suite of post-hoc explainability tools—including attention pattern attribution and neuron activation clustering—that map metric fluctuations back to input contexts and reasoning steps. To demonstrate interdisciplinary impact, we embed this metric within adaptive instructional systems and automated essay evaluation tools, enabling dynamic memory-aware feedback and traceability of reasoning steps crucial for educational outcome assessment and user trust in AI tutors. This methodological fusion enhances the metric's interpretability and real-world relevance, bridging cognitive modeling, explainable AI, and human-robot interaction paradigms aligned with HCI International conference themes. Preliminary pilot analyses on Transformer model hidden states corroborate feasibility, showing measurable decay-congruent patterns that correlate with recall fidelity, thereby reducing conceptual risks before scaling experiments.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Extend Transformer-based LLMs to systematically log internal hidden state trajectories and corresponding attention weights during inference.\n2. Formally implement neuro-inspired fidelity metrics combining mathematical models of human working memory decay and interference, validated through pilot studies.\n3. Validate metric correlations against traditional metrics (perplexity, BLEU, faithfulness) on benchmark multi-turn reasoning datasets including conversational dialogue and essay grading corpora.\n4. Integrate metric within prototype adaptive instructional system and automated essay evaluation workflows to assess impact on educational AI use cases.\n5. Conduct user studies with educators and learners to evaluate how metric explainability outputs influence trust and pedagogical effectiveness.\n6. Analyze metric performance and interpretability in real-world production-like pipelines to evaluate memory drift under dynamic inputs.\n7. Iterate metric parameters and explainability linkages based on empirical findings to optimize reliability and cross-domain applicability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A multi-turn dialogue in an AI tutoring system requiring recall of a student's previous preferences and misconceptions.\nExpected Output: A memory fidelity score that quantitatively identifies decay onset after specific dialogue turns, coupled with an explainability report visually highlighting corresponding hidden state activations and attention disruptions related to memory loss areas. This feedback dynamically informs adaptive instructional adjustments and improves transparent essay evaluations by tracking reasoning step persistence over text revisions.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If neuro-inspired fidelity metrics show weak correlation with actual LLM recall or educational outcome measures, we will pivot to analyzing attention weight distributions and neuron activation dynamics as alternative proxies for memory fidelity. To circumvent overfitting or proxy confounds, we will incorporate multi-modal signals (e.g., user interaction feedback) and reinforcement learning calibration to iteratively refine the metric's sensitivity and specificity. This fallback maintains focus on explainable, interpretable measures tied to real-world deployment needs, preserving educational and human-agent interaction relevance."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method outlines an intriguing neuro-inspired memory fidelity metric for LLMs but lacks sufficient detail on how human working memory capacity and decay mechanisms will be precisely modeled and quantitatively integrated with LLM hidden state trajectories. Clarify the modeling choices, mathematical formulations, and the interpretability framework's specifics, including how post-hoc explainability tools will concretely interact with the metric to identify memory strengths and weaknesses per input context. This will strengthen the soundness of the proposed approach and validate core assumptions about mapping human working memory onto LLM internal states effectively and meaningfully within the metric design framework, rather than conceptually or qualitatively alone. Consider adding preliminary formalizations or pilot study results to demonstrate feasibility of this key mechanism before full-scale experiments are begun, reducing conceptual ambiguity and potential risks of overfitting human memory concepts onto LLM behaviors without empirical rigor in their fusion. This clarity is critical to ensure the proposed metric truly measures memory fidelity rather than proxy signals or confounded variables like attention artifacts or representational similarity alone, thus improving the explanatory power and reliability of metric outcomes in real-world use cases like multi-turn dialogue recall as illustrated in your test example(s)."
