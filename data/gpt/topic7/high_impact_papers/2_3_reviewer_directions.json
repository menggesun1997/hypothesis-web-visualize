    "title": "Hippocampus-Inspired Memory Replay Mechanism to Stabilize Fine-Tuning Variance",
    "Problem_Statement": "Fine-tuning LLMs leads to unstable replicability due to catastrophic forgetting and inconsistent semantic drift across experiments.",
    "Motivation": "Inspired by the cognitive neuroscience connection and the lack of replicability evaluation techniques (Hidden Bridge 1), this work introduces hippocampal memory replay analogs to mediate stable fine-tuning outcomes, a transformative bio-inspired approach.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Implement a replay buffer simulating hippocampal episodic memory during fine-tuning, periodically revisiting representative past data samples to mitigate forgetting and stabilize semantic representations. Combine with prompt engineering to compare replicability effects.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Select datasets with episodic semantic clusters.\n2) Fine-tune LLMs with and without hippocampal replay.\n3) Measure stability of semantic embeddings and output consistency.\n4) Evaluate across multiple training runs and prompt types.\nModels: GPT-2, Bert-based models.\nMetrics: Embedding drift, output variance, task accuracy.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Sentiment analysis fine-tuning on product reviews.\nExpected Output: Consistent sentiment classification across runs, reduced embedding shifts post replay integration.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "Fallback to alternative continual learning strategies such as elastic weight consolidation or adaptive regularization if replay mechanism underperforms."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method lacks detailed clarity on how exactly the hippocampal replay buffer selects and revisits representative past data samples. Is the replay implemented as a fixed buffer or dynamically updated? How does it interface with fine-tuning steps to effectively counteract semantic drift? Without a rigorous mechanism description, reproducibility and evaluation of the approach will be challenging. Please add a precise algorithmic description or pseudocode to clarify the operational details of the replay mechanism and its integration with prompt engineering for consistency assessment, ensuring sound mechanistic grounding of the bio-inspired analogy and its practical implementation in LLM fine-tuning contexts. This will improve both soundness and clarity of the proposal's core innovation section in Proposed_Method. Targeting this early helps reviewers grasp feasibility and validity better."

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan needs strengthening on the experimental design front to ensure scientific rigor and clear validation of the hypothesis. While the plan covers datasets, models, and metrics, it lacks detail on control setups (e.g., baseline fine-tuning without replay), statistical power considerations (number of runs, variability quantification), and how prompt engineering variants will be systematically tested to isolate effects. Also, the choice of semantic cluster datasets should be justified more explicitly in relation to the hippocampal replay analogy. Providing a clear protocol for measuring embedding drift and output variance theoretically and empirically, including expected thresholds or benchmarks for 'stability', is crucial. This will increase confidence in the feasibility and validity of the evaluation, thus making the experimental plan actionable and compelling."
