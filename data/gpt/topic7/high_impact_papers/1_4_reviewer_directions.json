    "title": "Trust-Adapted Evaluation Metrics for LLMs in Sensitive Domains",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing LLM evaluation metrics inadequately capture trustworthiness and domain-specific nuances vital for replicability in high-stakes fields like clinical decision making.",
    "Motivation": "Novel integration of clinical decision support evaluation methodologies with LLM performance replicability emphasizes user-centric trust metrics, addressing the external gap related to domain-specific trust frameworks and replicability assessment.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop new composite metrics combining factual accuracy, uncertainty quantification, fairness indicators, and explanation completeness tailored to clinical workflows. Metrics weighted by domain expert feedback to reflect practical trust requirements. Implement metric-driven feedback loops for continuous model adaptation.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Review clinical evaluation standards.\n2. Define composite trust metric schema.\n3. Fine-tune LLMs on clinical tasks.\n4. Evaluate on clinical Q&A and diagnosis datasets.\n5. Conduct focus groups with clinicians for metric validation.\n6. Deploy metric feedback to guide LLM updates.\n7. Measure improvement in replicability and clinician trust.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Complex patient case with ambiguous symptoms.\nExpected Output: Trust score contextualizing model output confidence, evidence support, and fairness indicators tailored for clinical trust assessment.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If composite metrics are too complex, simplify by focusing on calibrated confidence intervals combined with rule-based fairness checks. Alternatively, employ proxy surveys for trust estimation in user groups."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experimental plan outlines relevant steps but lacks clarity on how metric-driven feedback loops will practically be implemented and evaluated in clinical LLM updates. More concrete methodology is needed for integrating clinician feedback quantitatively into metric weighting and continuous learning cycles to ensure feasibility. Additionally, the plan would benefit from specifying measurable criteria or success thresholds at each stage to track progress rigorously, especially for replicability and trust improvements in real workflows, which are challenging to quantify in practice. Clarification on dataset selection and validation protocols to avoid bias and data leakage would strengthen feasibility assessment as well. Consider piloting early iterations of the metric framework to identify integration challenges before full-scale deployment to address operational complexity risks early on in the timeline, improving scientific rigor and practical feasibility of the evaluation and adaptation loops proposed in the method section. This will significantly bolster confidence that the methodology can be realized and yield actionable results in sensitive clinical domains during subsequent experimental phases. The current description risks being too conceptual without these important practical details and validation criteria incorporated into the experiment plan documentation and design.

          "feedback_content": "Given the competitive novelty rating, enhancing the idea's distinctiveness by integrating knowledge graph techniques into the trust-adapted evaluation framework could be highly beneficial. For instance, structuring clinical knowledge, evidence sources, and decision rationales as a dynamic knowledge graph could enrich the explanation completeness and factual accuracy components of the composite metric. This would also facilitate traceability and provide richer context for uncertainty quantification and fairness assessments, making trust scores more transparent and interpretable to clinicians. Additionally, leveraging AI tools and agents that can interact with this knowledge graph to dynamically adjust trust metrics based on evolving clinical guidelines or patient contexts may increase impact and differentiation from existing evaluation methodologies. This approach aligns with the broader global concepts of AI tools, knowledge graphs, and information systems engineering, extending the contribution beyond metric design toward integrated AI-enabled clinical decision support evaluation. Introducing this integration as an optional or advanced phase could help differentiate the research idea in a crowded space and address the challenge of replicability and trustworthiness with a systems-level innovation.
