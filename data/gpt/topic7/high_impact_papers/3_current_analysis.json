BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.'}, {'paper_id': 2, 'title': 'GPT-4 Technical Report', 'abstract': \"We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can\\naccept image and text inputs and produce text outputs.

Usually, it is essential to understand the reasoning behind an AI model’s decision-making. Thus, the need for eXplainable AI (XAI) methods for improving trust in AI models has arisen. XAI has become a popular research subject within the AI field in recent years. Existing survey papers have tackled the concepts of XAI, its general terms, and post-hoc explainability methods but there have not been any reviews that have looked at the assessment methods, available tools, XAI datasets, and other related aspects. Therefore, in this comprehensive study, we provide readers with an overview of the current research and trends in this rapidly emerging area with a case study example. The study starts by explaining the background of XAI, common definitions, and summarizing recently proposed techniques in XAI for supervised machine learning. The review divides XAI techniques into four axes using a hierarchical categorization system: (i) data explainability, (ii) model explainability, (iii) post-hoc explainability, and (iv) assessment of explanations. We also introduce available evaluation metrics as well as open-source packages and datasets with future research directions. Then, the significance of explainability in terms of legal demands, user viewpoints, and application orientation is outlined, termed as XAI concerns. This paper advocates for tailoring explanation content to specific user types. An examination of XAI techniques and evaluation was conducted by looking at 410 critical articles, published between January 2016 and October 2022, in reputed journals and using a wide range of research databases as a source of information. The article is aimed at XAI researchers who are interested in making their AI models more trustworthy, as well as towards researchers from other disciplines who are looking for effective XAI methods to complete tasks with confidence while communicating meaning from data.'}, {'paper_id': 4, 'title': 'Trustworthy AI: From Principles to Practices', 'abstract': 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has enabled the deployment of various systems based on it. However, many current AI systems are found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection. These shortcomings degrade user experience and erode people’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we provide AI practitioners with a comprehensive guide for building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, and accountability. To unify currently available but fragmented approaches toward trustworthy AI, we organize them in a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to system development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items for practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers, engineers, and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges for the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for a paradigm shift toward comprehensively trustworthy AI systems.'}, {'paper_id': 5, 'title': 'Connecting the dots in trustworthy Artificial Intelligence: From AI principles, ethics, and key requirements to responsible AI systems and regulation', 'abstract': 'Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) is based on seven technical requirements sustained over three main pillars that should be met throughout the system’s entire life cycle: it should be (1) lawful, (2) ethical, and (3) robust, both from a technical and a social perspective. However, attaining truly trustworthy AI concerns a wider vision that comprises the trustworthiness of all processes and actors that are part of the system’s life cycle, and considers previous aspects from different lenses. A more holistic vision contemplates four essential axes: the global principles for ethical use and development of AI-based systems, a philosophical take on AI ethics, a risk-based approach to AI regulation, and the mentioned pillars and requirements. The seven requirements (human agency and oversight; robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental wellbeing; and accountability) are analyzed from a triple perspective: What each requirement for trustworthy AI is, Why it is needed, and How each requirement can be implemented in practice. On the other hand, a practical approach to implement trustworthy AI systems allows defining the concept of responsibility of AI-based systems facing the law, through a given auditing process. Therefore, a responsible AI system is the resulting notion we introduce in this work, and a concept of utmost necessity that can be realized through auditing processes, subject to the challenges posed by the use of regulatory sandboxes. Our multidisciplinary vision of trustworthy AI culminates in a debate on the diverging views published lately about the future of AI. Our reflections in this matter conclude that regulation is a key for reaching a consensus among these views, and that trustworthy and responsible AI systems will be crucial for the present and future of our society.'}, {'paper_id': 6, 'title': 'Explainable AI: Interpreting, Explaining and Visualizing Deep Learning', 'abstract': 'The development of “intelligent” systems that can take decisions and perform autonomously might lead to faster and more consistent decisions. A limiting factor for a broader adoption of AI technology is the inherent risks that come with giving up human control and oversight to “intelligent” machines. Forsensitive tasks involving critical infrastructures and affecting human well-being or health, it is crucial to limit the possibility of improper, non-robust and unsafe decisions and actions. Before deploying an AI system, we see a strong need to validate its behavior, and thus establish guarantees that it will continue to perform as expected when deployed in a real-world environment. In pursuit of that objective, ways for humans to verify the agreement between the AI decision structure and their own ground-truth knowledge have been explored. Explainable AI (XAI) has developed as a subfield of AI, focused on exposing complex AI models to humans in a systematic and interpretable manner. The 22 chapters included in this book provide a timely snapshot of algorithms, theory, and applications of interpretable and explainable AI and AI techniques that have been proposed recently reflecting the current discourse in this field and providing directions of future development. The book is organized in six parts: towards AI transparency; methods for interpreting AI systems; explaining the decisions of AI systems; evaluating interpretability and explanations; applications of explainable AI; and software for explainable AI.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology', 'abstract': 'The Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology (ESST) addresses the grand challenge for science and engineering today. It provides unprecedented, peer-reviewed coverage in more than 550 separate entries comprising 38 topical sections. ESST establishes a foundation for the many sustainability and policy evaluations being performed in institutions worldwide. An indispensable resource for scientists and engineers in developing new technologies and for applying existing technologies to sustainability, the Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology is presented at the university and professional level needed for scientists, engineers, and their students to support real progress in sustainability science and technology. Although the emphasis is on science and technology rather than policy, the Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology is also a comprehensive and authoritative resource for policy makers who want to understand the scope of research and development and how these bottom-up innovations map on to the sustainability challenge.'}, {'paper_id': 8, 'title': 'Trustworthy artificial intelligence and the European Union AI act: On the conflation of trustworthiness and acceptability of risk', 'abstract': 'In its AI Act, the European Union chose to understand trustworthiness of AI in terms of the acceptability of its risks. Based on a narrative systematic literature review on institutional trust and AI in the public sector, this article argues that the EU adopted a simplistic conceptualization of trust and is overselling its regulatory ambition. The paper begins by reconstructing the conflation of \"trustworthiness\" with \"acceptability\" in the AI Act. It continues by developing a prescriptive set of variables for reviewing trust research in the context of AI. The paper then uses those variables for a narrative review of prior research on trust and trustworthiness in AI in the public sector. Finally, it relates the findings of the review to the EU\\'s AI policy. Its prospects to successfully engineer citizen\\'s trust are uncertain. There remains a threat of misalignment between levels of actual trust and the trustworthiness of applied AI.'}, {'paper_id': 9, 'title': 'EU Policy and Legal Framework for Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Related Technologies - The AI Act', 'abstract': 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) can benefit our society and economy, but also brings with it new challenges and raises legal and ethical questions. According to the author of this comprehensive analysis, it is imperative to ensure that AI is developed and applied in an appropriate legal and regulatory framework that promotes innovation and investment and, at the same time, addresses the risks associated with certain uses of AI-related technologies. Essential to understanding the relationship between policy and law, this book traces the evolution of EU policy on artificial intelligence and robotics, focusing in particular on the EU’s ethical framework for AI, which defines trust as a prerequisite for ensuring a human-centric approach. The main part of the book provides a thorough and systematic analysis of the Commission’s 2021 proposed AI Act, which establishes harmonised rules for the development, placement on the market and use of AI systems in the EU. The author painstakingly compares the Commission’s proposed AI Act with the numerous “compromise” proposals of the Council of the European Union, leading to the final version of the Council’s AI Act (general approach) and its formal adoption on 6 December 2022. The author also examines with extraordinary detail the amendments proposed by the relevant committees and political groups of the European Parliament, revealing the position the Parliament is likely to adopt in the forthcoming negotiations with the Commission and the Council on the text of the AI Act. Numerous legislative and policy documents are presented in detail, while the analysis also considers the comments made by all interested parties (e.g. the European Commission, Council of the European Union, European Parliament, governmental organisations, national competent authorities, and stakeholders/actors with different/conflicting interests, such as corporations, business and consumer associations, civil society and other non-profit organisations). In the course of its in-depth analysis, this book will provide readers with crucial insight into the reasons behind the European Institutions’ different approaches and the often contradictory interests of stakeholders. Because the policy arguments are carefully balanced and drafted with scrupulous care, this volume will establish itself as a reference resource to be consulted for years to come.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Artificial Intelligence as a Disruptive Technology, Economic Transformation and Government Regulation', 'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) is the latest technological evolution which is transforming the global economy and is a major part of the “Fourth Industrial Revolution.” This book covers the meaning, types, subfields and applications of AI, including U.S. governmental policies and regulations, ethical and privacy issues, particularly as they pertain and affect facial recognition programs and the Internet-of Things (IoT). There is a lengthy analysis of bias, AI’s effect on the current and future job market, and how AI precipitated fake news. In addition, the text covers basics of intellectual property rights and how AI will transform their protection. The author then moves on to explore international initiatives from the European Union, China’s New Generation Development Plan, other regional areas, and international conventions. The book concludes with a discussion of super intelligence and the question and applicability of consciousness in machines. The interdisciplinary scope of the text will appeal to any scholars, students and general readers interested in the effects of AI on our society, particularly in the fields of STS, economics, law and politics.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "current_research_landscape": "The central problem addressed by this research cluster focuses on advancing large-scale pretrained language models (LLMs), particularly for English, that demonstrate human-level performance across various academic benchmarks and multimodal inputs/outputs. Core concepts such as 'language model,' 'pretrained models,' 'English,' and 'NLP' define a paradigm grounded in scaling Transformer-based architectures (e.g., GPT-4) and applying fine-tuning to improve task-specific outcomes. Dominant methodologies emphasize architectural innovations, extensive pretraining on curated datasets, and alignment techniques to enhance factuality, fairness, and desired behavior. Thematic clusters split between foundational language modeling principles and evaluation of human-level proficiency on professional tasks, reflecting a dual emphasis on model capability and real-world applicability. Trustworthiness, fairness, explainability (XAI), and regulation form an implicit backdrop interwoven through several foundational works addressing ethical AI deployment and governance.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite advances, there is an insufficient focus on bridging model performance and stable fairness/bias mitigation across deployment contexts. The absence of bridge nodes connecting clusters like 'language model' and 'human-level performance' signals a conceptual silo between model development and fairness or accountability considerations, which remain largely implicit. Stated limitations highlight risks from opaque datasets, environmental costs, and regulatory challenges, yet integration of these concerns into replicable, bias-stable LLM deployment workflows is underdeveloped. External/Novel Gaps: The global context reveals a hidden interdisciplinary opportunity by connecting 'language model' development with 'human-level performance' analyzed through psychological and cognitive science lenses (e.g., cognitive function, higher-order cognitive processes). This connection suggests leveraging cognitive psychology insights and brain-inspired mechanisms for improving fairness, bias robustness, and interpretability—areas underexplored in current NLP-centered works. Integrating cognitive models can offer novel framework for understanding and mitigating bias, improving human-model alignment and trustworthiness beyond existing computational and regulatory approaches.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate cognitive psychology constructs (e.g., human cognitive functions, prefrontal function) identified as hidden bridges with multimodal, human-level performance evaluation methods to develop more psychologically grounded fairness metrics and bias detection approaches, addressing the internal gap of stable fairness beyond benchmark-centric evaluations.\n\nOpportunity 2: Leverage explainable AI (XAI) methodologies, particularly post-hoc interpretability techniques discussed in foundational XAI surveys, combined with insights from cognitive and behavioral sciences, to create models whose fairness and decision-making stability can be transparently validated by diverse stakeholders—including underrepresented groups—to close the trust gap noted in current AI regulation and ethical principles.\n\nOpportunity 3: Develop lifecycle-spanning frameworks for trustworthy LLM deployment that unify technical fairness practices with regulatory compliance and human-centric evaluation informed by socio-cognitive factors. This can address critical deployment gaps by linking the rigor of EU regulatory AI act analyses with cutting-edge model interpretability and cognitive-behavioral insights, fostering responsible, bias-stable, replicable LLM applications in real-world settings."
