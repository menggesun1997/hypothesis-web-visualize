        "title": "Cognitively-Grounded Benchmark Suite for Assessing Replicability in Fine-Tuning and Example-Based Prompt Engineering of LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "The lack of a standardized, cognitively-grounded benchmarking framework that rigorously assesses replicability in both fine-tuning and example-based prompt engineering contexts limits reproducibility and comparative evaluation in large language model (LLM) research.",
        "Motivation": "Although some benchmarks evaluate LLM performance, few systematically focus on replicability, especially integrating cognitive science insights that can rigorously formalize replicability metrics. The NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty screening highlights the need to strengthen the benchmark's distinctiveness and community utility. By explicitly mapping cognitive learning and memory mechanisms—especially example-based learning and retrieval processes—to benchmark tasks and replicability metrics, this proposal aims to offer a uniquely rigorous, interdisciplinary benchmark. This will fill a critical gap by unifying replicability evaluation across fine-tuning and prompt engineering paradigms, leveraging the latest cognitive models and information retrieval theories to define reproducible, interpretable metrics with strong theoretical foundations.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an open benchmark suite with three complementary task categories: (1) Semantic Recall Tasks modeling episodic memory, operationalized as consistent retrieval responses across paraphrased queries; (2) Pattern Generalization Tasks reflecting abstraction and transfer learning; and (3) Example-Based Prompt Engineering Tasks grounded in cognitive theories of example-driven learning and retrieval, where replicability is evaluated under varying few-shot example sets. \n\nEach task links explicitly to a cognitive function, with formal computational definitions:\n\n- Semantic Recall: Consistency Score (CS) = 1 - Var_{runs}(OutputEmbeddingDistance(query paraphrases, model outputs)) computed over paraphrased queries and multiple runs, capturing stability in semantic retrieval.\n\n- Cognitive Consistency Indices integrate output variance with semantic similarity metrics derived via embedding clustering and Latent Semantic Analysis.\n\n- Example-Based Replicability Metric (EBRM): Measures variance in outputs' semantic similarity conditioned on changes in example prompts, inspired by exemplar-based retrieval models; operationalized by comparing output clusters over runs with different example selections.\n\nInformation retrieval inspired protocols guide dynamic task selection by estimating cognitive retrieval difficulty, enabling evaluation of replicability on progressively challenging retrieval tasks.\n\nBaseline evaluations use RoBERTa and T5, running multi-seed fine-tuning and prompting sweeps with the benchmark tasks. Public leaderboard infrastructure will report detailed replicability metrics, including variance, semantic consistency, and example-based robustness indices with transparent formula documentation to enable community extension and reproducibility.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Formalize cognitive task-function mappings with precise computational metrics (e.g., CS, EBRM).\n2) Curate and construct datasets that enable semantic recall tasks, pattern generalization tasks, and example-based prompt engineering trials.\n3) Implement baseline models (RoBERTa, T5) and design standardized fine-tuning and few-shot prompting protocols.\n4) Conduct extensive replication experiments with multiple random seeds and diverse example prompt variations.\n5) Analyze replicability using formal cognitive consistency indices and example-based replicability metrics.\n6) Develop and deploy a public leaderboard presenting model replicability profiles with interpretable visualizations based on cognitive theory.\n7) Provide full methodological documentation, metric source code, and formulaic explanations to ensure evaluation transparency and extensibility.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Semantic Recall Task: Model answers paraphrased geography questions ('What is the capital of France?' vs. 'Name the capital city of France.') across 10 runs.\n- Expected: Outputs cluster semantically around 'Paris' with high consistency score (CS close to 1).\n\nExample-Based Prompt Engineering Task: Model is prompted with different sets of few-shot examples for a sentiment classification task across multiple runs.\n- Expected: Low output variance and high Example-Based Replicability Metric (EBRM), indicating robustness to example set variation.\n\nPattern Generalization Task: Model classifies novel examples that require transfer of learned patterns; replicability measured by variance in output consistency across multiple training seeds.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If initial replicability metrics (CS, EBRM) lack sufficient discriminative power, augment the benchmark by incorporating additional cognitive dimensions such as working memory load and attention modulation. Explore alternate reliability metrics including inter-annotator agreement from crowdsourced human evaluations on model outputs for further semantic consistency validation. Additionally, iterative refinement of task difficulty and inclusion of synthetic cognitive noise perturbations during prompting will be explored to stress-test replicability robustness and better calibrate metrics."

For example, how exactly will semantic recall be operationalized beyond paraphrased question answering, and how will cognitive consistency indices be computed and validated? Clarify and formalize these mappings, and specify the rationale and computational procedures behind the proposed replicability metrics to ensure soundness and reproducibility of the evaluation framework itself. Without clearer mechanism details, the benchmark risks being abstract and difficult to interpret or extend by the community. Consider including illustrative formulas or prototype metric computations in the paper to strengthen this aspect of soundness in your design. This is critical because the novelty rests on leveraging cognitive theory in benchmark design, which needs a transparent and well-justified mechanism to be credible and useful for the community's replicability studies.

Specifically, incorporate tasks that test replicability in the context of few-shot or example-driven prompting, reflecting how cognitive psychology models example-based learning and transfer. This could differentiate the benchmark, expand its scope beyond fine-tuning to prompt engineering with concrete evaluation of how example variation impacts replicability. Additionally, by bridging information retrieval to design retrieval metrics or task selection protocols inspired by cognitive retrieval processes, the benchmark can unify crucial aspects of NLP pipeline replicability. This integration will align with the cutting-edge directions in LLM research, broaden the benchmark's applicability, and enhance its competitiveness in the current research landscape.
