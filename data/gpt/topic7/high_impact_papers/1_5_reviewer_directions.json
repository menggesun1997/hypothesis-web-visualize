    "title": "Cognitive-Inspired Dynamic Prompting for Enhanced LLM Memory Replicability",
    "Problem_Statement": "LLMs struggle to maintain replicable performance on tasks requiring sustained reasoning and memory over multiple interactions in dynamic production settings.",
    "Motivation": "Exploits hidden bridge between cognitive science of working memory and LLM input/output behavior to design dynamic prompts that emulate human memory rehearsal and chunking, thus improving replicability and interpretability.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Formulate adaptive prompt augmentation algorithms that iteratively summarize and restructure context inputs based on cognitive load theory. Use memory rehearsal-inspired mechanisms that periodically reinforce key facts within prompt windows to stabilize internal model states.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Analyze working memory models relevant to information chunking.\n2. Develop a dynamic prompt scheduler incorporating summarization and reinforcement.\n3. Test on multi-turn QA and reasoning benchmarks.\n4. Compare performance and stability with static prompting.\n5. Deploy prototype in simulated production environment.\n6. Measure improvement in output replicability and interpretability.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Seven-turn customer service dialogue.\nExpected Output: Stable and consistent responses with higher recall of early conversation facts due to rehearsal prompting, traceable via explanation logs.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If dynamic prompting fails to improve replicability, evaluate hybrid external memory modules or external knowledge retrieval mechanisms. Alternatively, explore prompt-tuning with memory-informed embeddings."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method outlines cognitively inspired dynamic prompting based on rehearsal and chunking to stabilize LLM internal states, but it lacks clarity on how these cognitive principles concretely translate into prompt engineering mechanisms. For instance, how exactly will chunking and rehearsal be algorithmically encoded and integrated within the prompt window constraints? Additionally, the method does not specify how to measure or ensure that periodic reinforcement stabilizes model states rather than causing prompt overload or unintended biases. Providing a formalized description or pseudocode of the adaptive prompt augmentation algorithm, along with theoretical justification linking cognitive load theory to prompt-level operations, is strongly recommended to strengthen soundness and reproducibility of the method. This will help reviewers and implementers assess the validity and technical novelty more rigorously rather than relying on analogies to human memory alone.  This is critical given the highly competitive area and existing prompt engineering techniques focusing on memory and context refinement.  Target Section: Proposed_Method."

          "feedback_content": "The step-by-step Experiment_Plan, while comprehensive, appears ambitious without specific contingencies for key technical challenges such as implementing dynamic prompt schedulers under prompt length limitations, or systematically quantifying 'replicability' and 'interpretability' in multi-turn reasoning tasks. For example, the plan should detail the evaluation metrics and statistical tests to validate improvements, specify datasets and baseline prompting strategies for meaningful comparison, and address scalability concerns in simulated production environments. Furthermore, fallback options mentioned (external memory modules or memory-informed embeddings) suggest potential risks in the main method's performance, but it is unclear how and when these will be triggered or evaluated. Adding milestones, risk assessment, and resource requirements would increase feasibility confidence. This detail is essential to convince reviewers of practical execution in a time-limited conference paper or prototype setting. Target Section: Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan."
