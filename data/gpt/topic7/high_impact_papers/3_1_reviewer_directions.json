    "title": "PsyFairEval: Psychologically Grounded Fairness Metrics for Human-Level LLM Evaluation",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current fairness evaluation metrics for LLMs focus on statistical parity or benchmark scores, failing to capture nuanced human cognitive responses to biased or unfair outputs, limiting true human-model alignment.",
    "Motivation": "Directly addresses Opportunity 1 by integrating cognitive psychology constructs into evaluation methodology, filling the gap in stable fairness detection by creating metrics that reflect human cognitive fairness perceptions beyond benchmark-centric measures.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop new fairness evaluation metrics grounded in cognitive load theory and moral judgment frameworks. This includes measuring cognitive dissonance induced by biased model outputs using user attention tracking, response latency, and sentiment analysis on human feedback. Incorporate these metrics into a composite psychological fairness score for LLM outputs.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Recruit human participants from diverse groups and collect responses to LLM outputs with varying bias levels. 2. Track physiological and behavioral indicators (eye-tracking, response time). 3. Correlate these with existing statistical fairness metrics and build predictive models mapping outputs to cognitive fairness scores. 4. Validate metrics on unseen tasks and demographic groups. 5. Release a benchmarking suite for psychological fairness evaluation.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM-generated responses to politically sensitive questions. Human evaluators show increased cognitive dissonance indicators for biased outputs, reflected by longer response times and negative sentiment, enabling calibration of the new fairness score.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If physiological measures are noisy, rely on crowd-sourced qualitative fairness ratings combined with NLP sentiment analysis as proxy signals. Alternatively, simplify metrics to textual features correlated with human bias perceptions."

          "feedback_code": "SOU-ASSUMPTION",
          "feedback_content": "The core assumption that cognitive load theory and moral judgment frameworks can robustly capture human perceptions of fairness in LLM outputs requires stronger justification. It is unclear whether cognitive dissonance measured via attention tracking, response latency, and sentiment analysis sufficiently differentiates between fairness-related cognitive responses and other confounding factors like complexity or interest. The proposal should clarify and possibly preliminarily validate these assumptions or reference prior psychological studies supporting this mapping to strengthen soundness and avoid confounding interpretations of fairness signals in human cognition and behavior metrics. This is critical before fully committing to metric development and model building steps that rely on these constructs as ground truths of psychological fairness perception.\n\nPlease augment the Problem_Statement and Proposed_Method sections with empirical or theoretical backing that explicitly connects the chosen psychological constructs to fairness perception in LLM outputs, anticipating alternative explanations and outlining how to isolate fairness-specific signals from general cognitive load or moral dissonance unrelated to fairness judgments."

          "feedback_code": "FEA-EXPERIMENT",
          "feedback_content": "The experimental plan is ambitious but contains practical challenges that may threaten the feasibility and validity of the results. For instance, eye-tracking and physiological measures to capture cognitive dissonance and attention require careful calibration and controlled environments, which may conflict with recruiting diverse participants and scaling data collection. Moreover, tracking subtle cognitive and affective responses to biased outputs could be highly noisy and influenced by demographic, cultural, and task-specific variables.\n\nThe fallback plan mentions relying on crowdsourced qualitative ratings and NLP sentiment analysis, which may not strongly correlate to cognitive dissonance signals, risking metric dilution or weakening the psychological grounding. The proposal should expand its contingency plans, for example, by integrating pilot studies or incremental metric development phases and providing more detailed protocols addressing noise reduction, participant diversity, environment standardization, and variable control.\n\nClarify how the experiment design will ensure statistical power, demographic representation, and cross-task generalization especially when physiological and behavioral indicators may produce noisy or ambiguous data."
