    "title": "Explain2Fair: Cognitive-Science-Driven Post Hoc XAI for Bias Stability Verification",
    "Problem_Statement": "Existing XAI techniques do not adequately facilitate transparency for underrepresented stakeholders to verify fairness and bias stability in LLM decisions, limiting trust and regulatory acceptance.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses Opportunity 2 by synthesizing post-hoc XAI methods with cognitive and behavioral science insights to create interpretable explanations that align with human reasoning patterns, making fairness verification more accessible and actionable.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Create an explanation framework that maps LLM decision pathways onto cognitive reasoning schemas (e.g., analogical reasoning, hypothesis testing) using concept attribution and counterfactual generation tailored to stakeholder cognitive profiles. Implement multimodal explanation interfaces (textual, visual) that adapt explanation complexity dynamically.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Select representative LLM tasks with fairness concerns. 2. Develop concept attribution layers aligned with cognitive task models. 3. Conduct user studies with diverse stakeholders to calibrate explanation modalities and complexity. 4. Measure fairness verification accuracy and trust metrics pre/post explanation. 5. Compare with baseline XAI tools in terms of stakeholder comprehension and engagement.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM decision on loan approval explanation for a minority applicant. Output: A layered explanation visually highlighting key evidence, counterfactual scenarios showing bias impact, and a simplified summary matching user cognitive style, increasing stakeholder trust in fairness assessment.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If user adaptation is challenging, fix explanation complexity levels optimized by iterative feedback. If cognitive schema mapping is inconclusive, use rule-based justification and contrastive explanations as a simpler surrogate."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method introduces a complex integration of cognitive reasoning schemas (like analogical reasoning and hypothesis testing) with concept attribution and counterfactual explanations. However, the description lacks clarity on how these diverse cognitive models will be concretely operationalized and mapped to LLM decision pathways. The mechanism for adapting explanations dynamically to different stakeholder cognitive profiles, while promising, remains underspecified and may pose significant conceptual and technical challenges. It is critical to provide a more detailed methodological framework clarifying the mapping process, the rationale for cognitive schema selection, and the algorithmic or modeling techniques used to instantiate the dynamic explanation interfaces to ensure soundness of the approach. Without this, it is difficult to assess validity and reproducibility of the core contribution in the Proposed_Method section, and potential limitations or trade-offs may be overlooked. Strengthening this aspect will also help clarify the novelty and scientific rigor of the contribution within the competitive related work landscape, supporting the initial NOV-COMPETITIVE rating assessment guidance.  Targeted elaboration will improve reviewability and implementation feasibility for future researchers and practitioners aiming to replicate or extend this work, thereby increasing trust in the framework's robustness and applicability beyond toy tasks or limited scenarios, ultimately contributing to impact and adoption potential in fairness verification for LLM-based systems across diverse stakeholder groups.”,"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lays out a logical progression from development to user studies to evaluation, which is a strength. However, it lacks specifics needed to fully judge feasibility: notably, how the diverse stakeholders will be selected and characterized in terms of cognitive styles; how cognitive task models will be operationalized quantitatively; what baseline XAI tools will be used for comparison and why; and the precise metrics and experimental protocols for measuring “fairness verification accuracy” and “trust.” User studies involving multimodal explanations and iterative adaptations are resource-intensive and complex. The plan should explicitly address these project management challenges, including sample sizes, data collection methods, and strategies to mitigate confounding variables (e.g., prior bias knowledge or tech literacy). Also, contingency plans to handle inconclusive or negative results beyond the Fallback_Plan would strengthen feasibility. Adding these operational details will substantially improve confidence that empirical validation can be rigorously conducted and that outcomes will be meaningful and generalizable across use cases and stakeholder populations, addressing potential reviewer concerns regarding practical impact and reproducibility."
