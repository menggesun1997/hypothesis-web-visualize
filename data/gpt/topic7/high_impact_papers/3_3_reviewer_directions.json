    "title": "RegulAlign: Lifecycle Framework Unifying Fairness, Regulation, and Socio-Cognitive Evaluation for LLM Deployment",
    "Problem_Statement": "No unified framework exists that spans technical fairness, regulatory compliance, and human-centric socio-cognitive evaluation to ensure bias-stable and trustworthy LLM deployments in real-world scenarios.",
    "Motivation": "Confronts Opportunity 3 by merging EU AI Act regulatory insights with model interpretability and cognitive-behavioral science to close deployment gaps, enabling replicable and accountable LLM use in practice.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an end-to-end deployment lifecycle pipeline incorporating modular components: (a) fairness-aware model training, (b) regulatory compliance audits using formal verification tools aligned with legal requirements, (c) socio-cognitive user studies and feedback loops measuring trust and perceived fairness. Integrate monitoring dashboards for continuous bias and compliance checks informed by real-time user interactions and cognitive metrics.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Define regulatory constraints from EU AI Act rulebooks. 2. Implement fairness-aware training on LLM models for target domains. 3. Build formal verification tools for compliance checking. 4. Conduct longitudinal user studies evaluating trust with cognitive load and feedback mechanisms. 5. Pilot the lifecycle framework in controlled deployment simulations. 6. Measure effectiveness via fairness metrics, compliance scores, and user trust indices.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Deployment of an LLM-powered hiring assistant in an EU country. Expected outcome: sustained fairness metrics within regulatory bounds, documented compliance certification, and high user trust validated through cognitive-behavioral assessments.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If full integration is complex, modularize into separate pipelines with interoperability interfaces supporting gradual adoption. Employ synthetic user simulations to test socio-cognitive components before real-world deployment."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is ambitious and spans multiple interdisciplinary areas (fairness training, legal formal verification, cognitive user studies). However, it lacks detailed operationalization in critical aspects—specifically, how formal verification tools will be concretely designed and integrated with model fairness auditing, and how socio-cognitive trust metrics will be reliably quantified and validated longitudinally. This raises concerns about the practical feasibility of simultaneous end-to-end evaluation. It is recommended to clearly decompose complex components into smaller, iterative milestones with defined measurable objectives, and to provide preliminary pilot studies demonstrating early proof-of-concept for each major component before full lifecycle integration. This will improve scientific rigor and realistic deployment expectations without compromising ambition or interdisciplinarity.\n\nAdditionally, the fallback plan to modularize is sound but should be expanded to specify interfaces and standards for interoperability to facilitate incremental adoption by practitioners with varying resource availability and domain constraints. Consider developing synthetic benchmarks for socio-cognitive simulation rigorously before real user studies to mitigate ethical and logistic challenges upfront, which is currently under-addressed in the plan.\n\nHence, without concrete clarification and staged validation, the feasibility of the overall experiment plan remains a major risk factor for success and credibility of the proposed framework."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict of NOV-COMPETITIVE and absence of globally linked concepts, a clear path to differentiate RegulAlign is crucial. To enhance impact and novelty, explicitly integrate emerging AI governance frameworks and standards beyond the EU AI Act, such as IEEE’s P7000 series on ethically aligned design or similar international guidelines, to establish a globally relevant compliance baseline. \n\nMoreover, propose embedding causal analysis techniques or explainability frameworks that link fairness audits and socio-cognitive trust signals, creating a closed-loop system that not only evaluates but also guides adaptative model retraining based on real-time metrics. \n\nThis global integration can position RegulAlign as a modular, adaptable lifecycle framework interoperable across jurisdictions and evolving regulations, giving it distinct advantage and higher impact in a crowded field. The authors should elaborate such integration designs and novel methodological connections as part of a future research agenda or roadmap section to increase competitive edge and practical uptake."
