        "title": "Explain2Fair: Operationalizing Cognitive-Science-Driven Post Hoc XAI for Robust Bias Stability Verification",
        "Problem_Statement": "Existing XAI approaches offer limited transparency for underrepresented stakeholders to effectively verify fairness and bias stability in large language model (LLM) decisions, often due to explanations misaligned with user cognitive processes, hampering trust and hindering regulatory compliance.",
        "Motivation": "Building on and surpassing current post-hoc XAI work, this proposal uniquely operationalizes cognitive science principles by systematically integrating specific, validated cognitive reasoning schemas into explanation generation. By tailoring explanations through dynamic, model-driven adaptation to stakeholder cognitive profiles, Explain2Fair directly addresses the interpretability-utility gap for fairness verification, differentiating itself through explicit methodological rigor, replicability, and scalability that current approaches lack. This advancement responds to NOV-COMPETITIVE assessments by concretely bridging human cognitive modeling and algorithmic explanation interaction, thereby enhancing transparency, trust, and actionable bias detection across diverse real-world stakeholder populations.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Explain2Fair consists of a three-layered methodological framework: (1) Cognitive Schema Selection and Formalization: Identify and select a targeted set of cognitive reasoning schemas—specifically analogical reasoning, hypothesis testing, and causal reasoning—based on cognitive psychology literature evidencing their relevance to fairness reasoning tasks. Each schema is formally modeled via computational cognitive architectures (e.g., ACT-R modules) or probabilistic program representations to precisely capture inference patterns. (2) Explanation Mapping Mechanism: Develop an algorithmic pipeline that decomposes LLM outputs into interpretable intermediate representations, such as concept attributions and causal feature importance, which are algorithmically mapped onto the formalized cognitive schemas. This mapping leverages structured feature extraction combined with schema-specific inference templates to generate explanations aligned with human reasoning processes. (3) Dynamic Explanation Interface Adaptation: Implement a machine learning-driven user modeling system that profiles stakeholders based on standardized cognitive style assessments (e.g., Need for Cognition, Working Memory Capacity) and interaction history. This system uses reinforcement learning to dynamically select explanation modalities (textual summaries, visual causal graphs, counterfactual scenarios) and levels of complexity to optimize comprehension and engagement. The entire framework is designed for modularity and reproducibility, with clear specifications of schema formalizations, mapping algorithms, and adaptation models, enabling extension and benchmarking.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Stakeholder Recruitment and Profiling: Recruit a diverse sample (n=150) representing underrepresented groups, regulatory agents, and domain experts. Profile cognitive styles using validated instruments (e.g., Cognitive Reflection Test) and collect demographic and prior knowledge data. 2. Cognitive Schema Operationalization: Implement formal models of analogical reasoning, hypothesis testing, and causal reasoning using ACT-R simulation and probabilistic programming frameworks; validate models through benchmark reasoning tasks. 3. Explanation Pipeline Development: Create datasets of LLM decision-making on fairness-sensitive tasks (e.g., loan approvals); extract concept attributions and causal features; develop mapping algorithms to generate schema-aligned explanations. 4. User Study – Within-Subjects Design: Present explanations generated by Explain2Fair versus leading baseline XAI tools (e.g., LIME, SHAP) to participants across modalities and complexity levels. Measure fairness verification accuracy through tasks requiring bias identification, standardized trust scales, cognitive load (NASA-TLX), and engagement metrics. 5. Data Analysis and Model Refinement: Analyze results using mixed-effects models controlling for cognitive style and prior knowledge; iteratively refine user modeling and explanation adaptation algorithms to maximize outcomes. 6. Contingency Planning: If dynamic adaptation proves limited, fix explanation presentations optimized via a priori cognitive profiling; if schema mapping yields inconclusive benefit, integrate rule-based contrastive explanations enriched with causal narratives as a fallback. 7. Generalization Testing: Validate framework scalability on additional LLM tasks and stakeholder groups to assess robustness and adoption potential.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: LLM-generated loan approval decision for a minority applicant flagged for potential bias. Output: For a stakeholder with high Need for Cognition, the system generates a detailed analogical reasoning explanation comparing this decision to prior similar cases, complemented by interactive causal graphs highlighting sensitive attributes' impact. For a stakeholder with lower technical literacy, a simplified textual summary employing hypothesis testing schema is presented, emphasizing key decision criteria and counterfactual scenarios illustrating bias presence or absence. This adaptive multimodal explanation significantly improves user ability to detect fairness violations, trust the system’s transparency, and engage with regulatory processes effectively.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If challenges in dynamic user adaptation arise due to resource or modeling constraints, implement fixed explanation complexity tiers determined by pre-study iterative feedback incorporating stakeholder preferences. If cognitive schema mapping proves inconclusive or technically infeasible, shift to a robust rule-based justification schema incorporating contrastive and causal explanations enhanced with graphical narratives, validated against baseline XAI techniques to ensure coverage of fairness verification needs."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method introduces a complex integration of cognitive reasoning schemas (like analogical reasoning and hypothesis testing) with concept attribution and counterfactual explanations. However, the description lacks clarity on how these diverse cognitive models will be concretely operationalized and mapped to LLM decision pathways. The mechanism for adapting explanations dynamically to different stakeholder cognitive profiles, while promising, remains underspecified and may pose significant conceptual and technical challenges. It is critical to provide a more detailed methodological framework clarifying the mapping process, the rationale for cognitive schema selection, and the algorithmic or modeling techniques used to instantiate the dynamic explanation interfaces to ensure soundness of the approach. Without this, it is difficult to assess validity and reproducibility of the core contribution in the Proposed_Method section, and potential limitations or trade-offs may be overlooked. Strengthening this aspect will also help clarify the novelty and scientific rigor of the contribution within the competitive related work landscape, supporting the initial NOV-COMPETITIVE rating assessment guidance.  Targeted elaboration will improve reviewability and implementation feasibility for future researchers and practitioners aiming to replicate or extend this work, thereby increasing trust in the framework's robustness and applicability beyond toy tasks or limited scenarios, ultimately contributing to impact and adoption potential in fairness verification for LLM-based systems across diverse stakeholder groups.”,"

          "feedback_content": "The Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan lays out a logical progression from development to user studies to evaluation, which is a strength. However, it lacks specifics needed to fully judge feasibility: notably, how the diverse stakeholders will be selected and characterized in terms of cognitive styles; how cognitive task models will be operationalized quantitatively; what baseline XAI tools will be used for comparison and why; and the precise metrics and experimental protocols for measuring “fairness verification accuracy” and “trust.” User studies involving multimodal explanations and iterative adaptations are resource-intensive and complex. The plan should explicitly address these project management challenges, including sample sizes, data collection methods, and strategies to mitigate confounding variables (e.g., prior bias knowledge or tech literacy). Also, contingency plans to handle inconclusive or negative results beyond the Fallback_Plan would strengthen feasibility. Adding these operational details will substantially improve confidence that empirical validation can be rigorously conducted and that outcomes will be meaningful and generalizable across use cases and stakeholder populations, addressing potential reviewer concerns regarding practical impact and reproducibility."
