These shortcomings degrade user experience and erode people’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we provide AI practitioners with a comprehensive guide for building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, and accountability. To unify currently available but fragmented approaches toward trustworthy AI, we organize them in a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to system development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items for practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers, engineers, and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges for the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for a paradigm shift toward comprehensively trustworthy AI systems.'}, {'paper_id': 7, 'title': 'Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology', 'abstract': 'The Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology (ESST) addresses the grand challenge for science and engineering today.

Clinical predictive models can help physicians and administrators make decisions by forecasting clinical and operational events. Existing structured data-based clinical predictive models have limited use in everyday practice owing to complexity in data processing, as well as model development and deployment1–3. Here we show that unstructured clinical notes from the electronic health record can enable the training of clinical language models, which can be used as all-purpose clinical predictive engines with low-resistance development and deployment. Our approach leverages recent advances in natural language processing4,5 to train a large language model for medical language (NYUTron) and subsequently fine-tune it across a wide range of clinical and operational predictive tasks. We evaluated our approach within our health system for five such tasks: 30-day all-cause readmission prediction, in-hospital mortality prediction, comorbidity index prediction, length of stay prediction, and insurance denial prediction. We show that NYUTron has an area under the curve (AUC) of 78.7–94.9%, with an improvement of 5.36–14.7% in the AUC compared with traditional models. We additionally demonstrate the benefits of pretraining with clinical text, the potential for increasing generalizability to different sites through fine-tuning and the full deployment of our system in a prospective, single-arm trial. These results show the potential for using clinical language models in medicine to read alongside physicians and provide guidance at the point of care.'}, {'paper_id': 10, 'title': 'Semantic Communications for Future Internet: Fundamentals, Applications, and Challenges', 'abstract': 'With the increasing demand for intelligent services, the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will shift from a traditional architecture that focuses solely on a high transmission rate to a new architecture that is based on the intelligent connection of everything. Semantic communication (SemCom), a revolutionary architecture that integrates user as well as application requirements and the meaning of information into data processing and transmission, is predicted to become a new core paradigm in 6G. While SemCom is expected to progress beyond the classical Shannon paradigm, several obstacles need to be overcome on the way to a SemCom-enabled smart Internet. In this paper, we first highlight the motivations and compelling reasons for SemCom in 6G. Then, we provide an overview of SemCom-related theory development. After that, we introduce three types of SemCom, i.e., semantic-oriented communication, goal-oriented communication, and semantic-aware communication. Following that, we organize the design of the communication system into three dimensions, i.e., semantic information (SI) extraction, SI transmission, and SI metrics. For each dimension, we review existing techniques and discuss their benefits and limitations, as well as the remaining challenges. Then, we introduce the potential applications of SemCom in 6G and portray the vision of future SemCom-empowered network architecture. Finally, we outline future research opportunities. In a nutshell, this paper provides a holistic review of the fundamentals of SemCom, its applications in 6G networks, and the existing challenges and open issues with insights for further in-depth investigations.'}]\n```\n\n### Part B: Local Knowledge Skeleton\nThis is the topological analysis of the local concept network built from the above papers.

    "current_research_landscape": "The core research cluster targets achieving human-level performance in large language models (LLMs), focusing on multimodal inputs (text, image) and outputs, benchmarked rigorously on academic and professional tasks. Central to this pursuit are natural language processing applications enhanced by reinforcement learning and large-scale pretraining, enabling adaptability and scalability across domains. The dominant paradigms involve transformer-based architectures (e.g., GPT-4), instruction fine-tuning, and post-training alignment processes to improve factuality and behavioral adherence. Methodologically, the landscape emphasizes state-of-the-art models operationalized via open-source implementations and encyclopedic software resources, facilitating reproducibility and extensibility. The local conceptual clusters highlight (1) performance and multimodality, (2) language processing innovations using word-cloud and reinforcement learning techniques, and (3) an ecosystem of software and model resources supporting these advances, with bridge nodes underscoring the importance of state-of-the-art modeling as connective tissue across themes.",
    "critical_gaps": "Internal Gaps: Despite high performance, foundational papers (e.g., GPT-4) acknowledge limitations in real-world scenario robustness and domain generalizability. The bridge node 'state-of-the-art models' suggests fragmentation between performance optimization and software/tool integration, indicating a gap in unified frameworks for efficient, replicable deployment at scale. There is also a relative lack of emphasis on systematic benchmarking and standardization across heterogeneous domains, impacting replicability and generalizability. External/Novel Gaps: Global Context analysis reveals unexplored interdisciplinary connections. Notably, the co-occurrence of 'human-level performance' and 'language processing applications' with cognitive neuroscience concepts such as working memory and brain regions (e.g., inferior frontal gyrus) suggests bio-inspired models could enhance LLM efficiency and adaptability. Similarly, links between 'encyclopedic presentation' and semantic/neuroimaging research indicate opportunities to incorporate cognitive semantic architectures to improve interpretability and explainability in LLMs. These cross-disciplinary bridges are absent in the current literature but could address issues of robustness, transferability, and trustworthiness in LLM deployment.",
    "high_potential_innovation_opportunities": "Opportunity 1: Integrate cognitive neuroscience insights (e.g., working memory architectures, gating mechanisms from inferior frontal gyrus studies) with existing transformer-based state-of-the-art models to enhance computational efficiency and replicability in LLM performance across domains. This bio-inspired approach targets internal gaps in robustness and domain generalization.\n\nOpportunity 2: Leverage semantic representation research and neuroimaging findings on episodic memory and prefrontal semantic processing to develop more interpretable and explainable LLM architectures. Coupling these insights with the encyclopedic presentation paradigm can create LLMs with improved user trust and transparency.\n\nOpportunity 3: Develop a unified, open-source software framework that bridges advanced LLM architectures with cognitive and semantic models, fostering standardized benchmarking and replicable deployment pipelines. This addresses the internal fragmentation and external opportunity to embed interdisciplinary knowledge for sustainable and trustworthy AI systems."
