        "title": "NeuroTransformer: Incorporating Working Memory Gating Mechanisms into Transformer Architectures",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current large language models (LLMs) achieve high performance but lack robust domain generalization and computational efficiency, especially under real-world demands. Traditional transformers process input sequences without explicit working memory mechanisms as found in human cognition, limiting adaptability and efficiency.",
        "Motivation": "This project targets the internal gaps of robustness and efficiency by integrating cognitive neuroscience insights—specifically working memory architectures and gating mechanisms identified in the inferior frontal gyrus—into transformer models. This bio-inspired integration is novel because existing transformer architectures do not leverage such biologically grounded gating to selectively store and overwrite information, which can reduce computational overhead while maintaining performance.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose augmenting the standard transformer architecture with a dynamic gating module modeled after working memory circuits. This module will selectively gate token embeddings at each transformer layer, regulating information flow similar to the prefrontal cortex’s working memory. The gating parameters will be trainable and controlled by a recurrent gating controller network that learns which tokens to retain, update, or discard dynamically per input domain and context. This approach simulates human executive control’s selective attention and memory updating to optimize computational resources and generalizability.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement NeuroTransformer with gating modules in PyTorch, initially benchmarking on GLUE and SuperGLUE datasets.\n2) Compare performance and computational efficiency against baselines like GPT-4 small-scale variants without gating.\n3) Stress-test on cross-domain transfer tasks (e.g., legal, biomedical) to evaluate improved robustness.\n4) Conduct ablation to evaluate gating contribution.\n5) Analyze computational cost savings and reproduce behavior across multiple runs for replicability.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Analyze the biochemical pathways involved in DNA replication in human cells.\"\nExpected behavior: The gating mechanism selectively focuses on entities relevant to biochemical processes, pruning less relevant tokens and preserving core facts for domain accuracy, enhancing interpretability of attention and yielded responses.\nOutput: A precise summary of DNA replication pathways with concise terminology and minimal redundant computation, replicable across runs.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If gating modules do not improve efficiency or degrade performance, explore alternative biologically inspired mechanisms such as synaptic plasticity-inspired adaptive weights or incorporate neuromodulatory signals for dynamic layer weighting. Alternatively, simplify gating to static masks or use sparsity-inducing regularizers."

        "title": "Semantic Episodic Memory Integration for Explainable LLMs",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLMs currently perform well but suffer from limited interpretability and user trust due to their opaque decision-making processes and lack of semantic memory-like episodic recall capabilities.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the external gap linking neuroimaging research on episodic memory and semantic processing with AI can enhance LLM explainability. By incorporating semantic and episodic memory architectures inspired by prefrontal semantic processing and hippocampal episodic memory, we address explainability and user trust gaps highlighted in the analysis.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop an LLM architecture augmented with a dual-memory system: a semantic memory representing general world knowledge embedding layers, and an episodic memory module storing indexed interactions and context embeddings over time. The episodic memory uses neuro-inspired indexing and retrieval akin to hippocampal mechanisms, enabling explicit grounding and traceability of LLM responses. This memory system output layers fuse with the generation process to provide citation-like explanations and grounded reasoning paths.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Build episodic-semantic memory modules compatible with transformer-based LLMs.\n2) Fine-tune on datasets with contextual dialogue and explanation needs (e.g., ELI5, HotpotQA).\n3) Evaluate explainability with human evaluation and automatic metrics (e.g., faithfulness, rationalization).\n4) Benchmark user trust via surveys with explanations enabled vs. disabled.\n5) Compare response accuracy and explainability against GPT-4 base models.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: \"Why is photosynthesis important for the ecosystem?\"\nOutput: \"Photosynthesis enables plants to convert sunlight into energy, producing oxygen essential for animal life (Semantic Memory). Previously, in our discussion on carbon cycles (Episodic Memory), we noted how this oxygen supports respiration.\"\nHere the model explicitly references semantic facts and prior interaction, enhancing transparency.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If explicit memory fusion impairs generation fluency, attempt lightweight post-hoc explanation models or integrate interpretability probes analyzing internal embeddings. Alternatively, focus on semantic memory alone or explore self-explanation finetuning methods."

        "title": "Open Multi-Domain Benchmark Suite With Unified Evaluation Metrics for LLM Replicability",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current LLM research suffers from fragmented benchmarking standards and inconsistent evaluation metrics across heterogeneous domains, limiting replicability and comparability of computational efficiency improvements.",
        "Motivation": "This project directly addresses the critical internal gap of lack of systematic benchmarking and standardization by developing a unified, open-source benchmarking framework that standardizes datasets, tasks, metrics, and evaluation protocols across diverse real-world domains (medical, legal, scientific). This also supports the third innovation opportunity of bridging software ecosystem fragmentation.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Design and implement an extensible benchmarking platform incorporating curated multi-domain datasets standardized for format and evaluation criteria. The framework includes automatic metric calculators, replicable model training and evaluation pipelines with containerized environments, and continuous integration for benchmarking new models and releases. The platform supports plug-and-play cognitive model components to evaluate bio-inspired methods.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Curate a representative collection of datasets spanning at least five distinct domains.\n2) Design consistent evaluation metrics capturing accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and replicability.\n3) Develop modular software infrastructure using containers, APIs, and open repositories.\n4) Validate framework by benchmarking existing state-of-the-art LLMs.\n5) Release as open-source tool and solicit community contributions.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Running benchmark with GPT-4, NeuroTransformer, and Semantic Episodic Memory LLMs across legal contract understanding, biomedical question answering, financial text summarization, news categorization, and multilingual translation.\nExpected output: Standardized performance tables, resource usage graphs, replicability reports allowing fair side-by-side comparison.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If dataset licensing prevents access, design synthetic or simulated datasets with domain-specific characteristics. If automation is complex, start with semi-automated pipelines and manual verification before scaling."

        "title": "Inferior Frontal Gyrus-inspired Adaptive Attention Modulation for LLM Efficiency",
        "Problem_Statement": "Transformer self-attention mechanisms are computationally costly and sometimes lack adaptability to heterogeneous inputs, limiting LLM efficiency and domain generalizability.",
        "Motivation": "Inspired by the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) gating and cognitive control functions, this project proposes an adaptive attention modulation mechanism to dynamically allocate computational resources during transformer attention calculation. This addresses computational inefficiency and domain robustness, filling internal fragmentation gaps by embedding neuroscience insights actively into transformer design.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Introduce a lightweight controller network trained to modulate attention weights sparsity and focus dynamically based on input context cues, simulating top-down IFG gating. This controller gates attention heads and token interactions on the fly, reducing redundant calculations and enhancing focus on salient input components. The gating mechanism is differentiable and jointly optimized with the LLM.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Implement adaptive attention modulation in existing transformers.\n2) Pretrain and fine-tune on multi-domain language tasks.\n3) Compare computational efficiency, throughput, and accuracy with standard transformers.\n4) Measure domain transfer performance.\n5) Conduct ablation on gating controller configurations.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Example: Given a long document containing mixed technical and narrative sections, the model dynamically downweights attention to less relevant narrative tokens when performing scientific question answering.\nOutput: Focused and efficient attention maps with reduced compute and preserved accuracy.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If adaptive modulation reduces model performance, simplify gating to fixed attention masks learned per domain or incorporate reinforcement learning to optimize gating policies."

        "title": "Cognitive-Semantic Embedding Alignment for Cross-Domain LLM Robustness",
        "Problem_Statement": "LLMs often underperform when transferred to novel domains because embeddings lack alignment with human cognitive semantic structures, limiting robustness and replicability across tasks.",
        "Motivation": "By bridging neurosemantic research and transformer embedding spaces, this project proposes aligning learned embeddings with cognitive semantic architectures derived from neuroimaging and linguistic conceptual maps. This addresses the external novel gap concerning embedding interpretability and domain transfer reliability.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a multi-objective training procedure that aligns LLM embedding spaces with cognitive semantic graphs extracted via neuroimaging meta-analyses and semantic knowledge bases. Introduce a regularization loss that pulls embeddings closer to cognitive prototypes while preserving downstream task performance. This embedding alignment improves internal structure, interpretability, and cross-domain generalization.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Extract cognitive semantic graph datasets from neuroscience literature.\n2) Integrate embedding alignment loss terms into transformer training objectives.\n3) Train on natural language tasks with auxiliary alignment.\n4) Evaluate domain generalization and interpretability.\n5) Compare against vanilla transformer baselines.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "For input: \"Describe the economic impact of climate change,\" the model grounds embeddings to cognitive concepts like 'economics,' 'climate,' 'impact' structured as per human semantic organization, yielding responses that generalize better to unseen economic domains.\nOutput: Detail-rich, semantically coherent paragraphs with embedded cognitive consistency.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If multi-objective training reduces task accuracy, decouple alignment as a post-training embedding projection or explore distillation from cognitively-aligned teacher models."
