        "title": "Educational Training Protocols Embedding Statistical and Cognitive Rigor for LLM Replicability with Adaptive Human-Centric Interactive Modules",
        "Problem_Statement": "Researchers in LLM fine-tuning and prompt design currently lack access to systematic, integrated training protocols that not only teach replicability principles grounded in statistics and cognitive psychology, but also adaptively engage learners through human-centric interactive feedback mechanisms. This gap hinders progress towards consistent, reproducible experimentation in LLM research.",
        "Motivation": "While replicability challenges and the need for rigorous statistical education in AI research are well recognized, current training initiatives often lack interdisciplinary integration and adaptability to individual learner needs. Our approach uniquely blends health literacy-inspired practical modules, cognitive theories tailored to LLM research, and adaptive human-robot interaction elements such as AI-powered coaching agents. This fusion enhances learner engagement and cognitive load management, elevating replicability training beyond existing programs, and positioning this work competitively in AI education innovation space.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Develop a standardized, modular educational program combining: (a) comprehensive modules on statistical rigor and experimental design for replicability; (b) cognitive science principles focused on semantic memory and cognitive load; and (c) interactive labs applying open-source LLM tooling for fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Crucially, integrate AI-powered adaptive coaching agents inspired by human-robot interaction research to provide real-time personalized feedback and explanations, adjusting to individual learner cognitive styles and load. The program includes validated pre/post assessments on replicability knowledge and skills, and offers a replicability certification. Human-centric adaptive feedback aims to heighten engagement and enhance learning outcomes, making the method novel and distinctive.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1) Conduct comprehensive literature surveys in statistics education, cognitive psychology, and human-robot interaction to inform curriculum design. 2) Develop curriculum with adaptive interactive modules and AI coaching prototypes. 3) Recruit a well-defined pilot cohort of at least 60 graduate NLP researchers stratified by prior replicability experience to enable control and experimental groups: 30 in adaptive training group, 30 in standard training control. 4) Pre-assess all participants using standardized replicability knowledge tests and standardized LLM experiment replication tasks quantifying metrics such as percentage of correctly replicated results and experiment variance. 5) Conduct training interventions: experimental group receives adaptive coaching-enhanced training, control group receives conventional training without adaptive elements. 6) Post-assess replicability performance with same standardized tasks. 7) Analyze outcomes using appropriate inferential statistical tests (e.g., ANCOVA controlling for baseline scores) and effect size measures to evaluate replicability improvements and between-group differences. 8) Collect qualitative feedback and cognitive load measures to assess learner experience. 9) Iterate curriculum and AI coaching based on findings, following standards of educational and cognitive experiment methodology. Environment includes Jupyter notebooks and adaptive coding platforms with embedded AI coach.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Pre-training baseline: A researcher from the cohort achieves only 40% success in replicating a benchmark set of LLM fine-tuning experiments, showing typical replicability failures. After completing the adaptive training, the same researcher improves replication success rate to 85%, with reduced experiment variance and higher confidence scores. Control group participants receiving standard training demonstrate smaller average improvements, e.g., from 42% to 60%. Qualitative feedback also reflects increased motivation and lower cognitive load in adaptive training group, illustrating efficacy of human-centric AI feedback integration.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If pilot results show marginal or inconsistent improvements, fallback strategies include increasing interactivity and scenario diversity, enhancing the AI coaching feedback algorithms with more sophisticated human-robot interaction models, incorporating peer-review and collaborative learning modules, and applying more granular cognitive load management techniques such as personalized pacing and content chunking. Additionally, extend pilot sample size to improve statistical power and explore hybrid delivery modes to increase accessibility and engagement."

Key aspects needing clarification include the criteria for selecting pilot participants, statistical methods for evaluating replicability improvement, handling variability in LLM experiments, and specific metrics used for pre/post assessments. Providing a more rigorous experimental design with control groups or baseline comparisons would greatly enhance feasibility and credibility of the conclusions drawn. Additionally, elaborating on how replicability is operationalized and quantified would improve replicability of this work by others. Consider integrating established experimental methodology standards from education and cognitive psychology research to strengthen the protocol further.
