        "title": "Explainable Multimodal Evaluation Protocols for Medical LLMs Using Knowledge-Grounded Semantic Alignment and Concept Bottleneck Integration",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current multimodal large language models (LLMs) aimed at clinical applications lack robust, mechanistically sound explainability and replicability evaluation protocols tailored to the complex semantics and heterogeneity of combined clinical text and imaging data. Existing approaches predominantly rely on generic attention mappings or superficial alignment techniques that fail to ensure clinical fidelity, semantic consistency, and causal interpretability critical for trustworthy deployment in real-world medical decision support contexts.",
        "Motivation": "Bridging the significant gap between high multimodal LLM performance and clinically trustworthy decision support requires explainability frameworks that go beyond modality-centric attention or attribution methods. By integrating clinically curated knowledge structures and concept bottleneck models, we propose a uniquely robust, semantically grounded evaluation protocol that jointly interprets and validates textual and imaging outputs with domain-aware alignment. This approach addresses current competitive limitations by embedding structured clinical semantics and causal reasoning into multimodal LLM explainability, thereby enhancing replicability, interpretability, and trust indicators essential for clinical adoption and impact.",
        "Proposed_Method": "Our method introduces a multimodal explainability architecture combining three key components: (1) Cross-modal Clinical Semantic Alignment Module (CCSAM) that maps imaging features and textual tokens into a shared, clinically grounded embedding space guided by a medical knowledge graph (e.g., UMLS, RadLex). CCSAM employs graph neural networks to encode hierarchical relations among medical entities and integrates these embeddings with transformer-based LLM attention weights to establish fine-grained, causally plausible correspondences between salient image regions and clinically relevant text concepts. (2) Concept Bottleneck Explanation Layer where intermediate, interpretable clinical concepts derived from the knowledge graph serve as bottleneck variables within the multimodal LLM. This layer constrains model predictions through clinically validated concepts such as disease mentions, imaging findings, and biomarkers, enabling concept-level attribution and transparent reasoning paths. (3) A novel Evaluation Protocol with joint metrics assessing cross-modal semantic consistency, concept-level causal attribution validity, and replicability of explanations leveraging the knowledge graph as a ground truth reference. This includes quantitatively measuring explanation adherence to clinical ontologies, cross-modal concordance of salient concepts, and stability over perturbations. The overall workflow integrates graph-based semantic embeddings tightly with transformer attention and causal attribution mechanisms customized for the medical domain, advancing current paradigms beyond generic attention visualizations by aligning with clinically relevant causal pathways and concept schemas. This mechanistic clarity supports reproducibility and meaningful clinical interpretability, enabling rigorous evaluation and trustworthiness claims.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Curate and preprocess a multimodal clinical dataset pairing radiology reports with corresponding images, enriched with entity-level clinical annotations linked to medical ontologies.\n2. Construct or adapt a comprehensive clinical knowledge graph integrating concepts relevant to the datasetâ€™s domain, encoding hierarchical and causal relations.\n3. Develop the Cross-modal Clinical Semantic Alignment Module incorporating graph neural networks and transformer architectures to jointly embed and align imaging features with text tokens via clinical knowledge embeddings.\n4. Implement concept bottleneck layers within the multimodal LLM architecture, training the model to predict intermediate clinical concepts prior to final diagnosis outputs.\n5. Define and formalize evaluation metrics that quantify semantic alignment, concept-level causal attribution consistency, and explanation replicability grounded in the medical knowledge graph.\n6. Benchmark the explainability framework on clinical standards and compare against state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal explainability methods.\n7. Conduct clinician-in-the-loop validation studies assessing the clinical coherence, usefulness, and trustworthiness of explanations produced.\n8. Analyze replicability quantitatively through repeated trials and perturbation tests to establish robustness of explanations and agreement with clinical semantics.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A chest x-ray image paired with its corresponding radiology report mentioning suspected pneumonia.\nExpected Output:\n- Aligned salient image regions focusing on pulmonary infiltrates or consolidation areas linked with textual mentions of relevant clinical signs.\n- Concept bottleneck outputs highlighting key annotated concepts such as 'infiltrate', 'consolidation', and 'fever'.\n- Explanation reports demonstrating causal consistency through the knowledge graph indicating known clinical pathways from imaging findings to diagnosis.\n- Replicability scores showing stable concept-level and cross-modal explanations across perturbations.\n- Validation feedback confirming explanations align with clinical understanding and ontology relations.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "Should cross-modal semantic alignment using clinical knowledge graphs prove technically infeasible, we will pivot to refine unimodal concept bottleneck explainability approaches independently for text and imaging modalities, leveraging domain-specific clinical ontologies to extract interpretable concepts. Alternatively, surrogate interpretable models based on concept bottlenecks will be developed per modality with post-hoc integration assessed via clinically validated mapping heuristics. This partial approach still improves interpretability and trustworthiness beyond generic attention overlays and provides foundations for future integration once computational or data challenges are addressed."

          "feedback_content": "The Proposed_Method describes using aligned attention mapping and causal attribution tailored for clinical semantics to integrate explainability across text and imaging outputs. However, the mechanism for how alignment and causal attribution will be operationalized and validated across these heterogeneous modalities is not clearly explained. More clarity is needed on the technical approach to achieve cross-modal alignment with causal interpretability, including architectures, alignment strategies, and how clinical semantics guide these mechanisms. This clarity is critical for assessing soundness and reproducibility of the method and should be detailed before advancing further in experiments or deployment plans to ensure the planning is grounded in a robust technical framework that addresses cross-modal explainability effectively and uniquely in clinical contexts, rather than relying on generic attention mappings or superficial alignment approaches that may lack clinical fidelity or interpretability validity in real-world multi-modal medical data contexts, which have complex semantics and varying data structures across text and images. Providing a more concrete and detailed mechanism would reduce risks of failure and improve understanding of novelty beyond competitive literature in multimodal LLM explanation paradigms in medicine. This should precede or be integrated tightly with the Experiment_Plan stages 2 and 3 to guide implementation and evaluation choices meaningfully and pragmatically, ensuring clinical relevance and reliability rather than generic adaptation of standard attention or causal approaches without domain-specific adaptations clearly outlined and justified technically and clinically.  This refinement is mandatory to qualify as a sound technical contribution and avoid potential superficiality or overly broad assumptions of explainability integration in medical multimodal LLMs currently active in research space, to reach beyond NOV-COMPETITIVE novelty status effectively and establish trustworthiness for clinical decision support usage as claimed in the motivation section without undermining scientific soundness and mechanistic clarity before expending large resources on experimental validation or clinical interpretation collection phases.  Please provide a detailed architectural and algorithmic description of your approach to aligned attention mapping and causal attribution tailored for clinical semantics to address this gap and solidify soundness of the method proposed with modality-specific justifications and reference to existing explainability techniques adapted or extended for clinical text-image multimodal data integration explicitly to demonstrate feasibility and replicability basis beyond basic attention visualization or proxy causal correlations used in current state-of-the-art work, which will clarify your unique contributions and reliable innovation beyond established competitive baselines in this highly active research area in medical AI interpretability for multimodal LLMs.  This improvement will mitigate risks in subsequent experimental and impact phases, increasing confidence in outcomes and clinical acceptance potential, and therefore should be prioritized over advancing ungrounded experimental protocols or fallback plans prematurely without a robust mechanistic foundation first established here for your methodâ€™s explainability core component design and integration strategy aligned with clinical semantics rigor and multimodal data representation complexities inherent in medical imaging and text combined contexts, ensuring scientific rigor and clinical utility promise cohesion in your proposalâ€™s foundational stages before extending to larger scale evaluation or replicability claims at step 7 or test case generalization assessments for trust indicators deployment readiness phases, which rely heavily on this mechanismâ€™s soundness upfront to justify downstream experimental investments and expected impact claims sufficiently as communicated in your proposal currently in its present form.  In sum, please explicate your core methodâ€™s mechanism of cross-modal explainability integration with clinical semantic tailoring rigorously with explicit technical details before advancing to experiments or validating clinician feedback and replicability analyses to ensure method soundness ahead of feasibility and impact demonstrations, avoiding gaps that risk undermining your approachâ€™s ability to distinctly and reliably operationalize explainability across multimodal clinical data within the highly competitive medical LLM explainability research landscape you target.  This will enable a confident, replicable, and clinically meaningful evaluation protocol basis surpassing current shortfalls in multimodal LLM explainability that identify failures often due to insufficient method mechanistic transparency or modality alignment clarity rather than lack of data or transformer engine implementation alone as currently drafted in your plan.  The ultimate goal is to have a robustly defined, clinically interpretable, replicable, and causally justified cross-modal explainability approach to produce trustworthy multimodal clinical LLM outputs as envisioned, which is currently at risk of being too vague or generic at the core.  Clarify and deepen this mechanism before proceeding further is essential for the proposalâ€™s overall soundness and effective impact realization potential as claimed in Motivation and Test_Case_Examples sections that depend heavily on this foundational component being convincingly designed and explained upfront along with the experimental planning stages keyed to it accordingly for coherence and success likelihood in your clinical decision support application context, where explainability failures can have real-world safety implications and must be resolved within your research design at the conceptual and technical level before experimental or deployment validations.  This should be prioritized as the main revision focus before addressing other proposal elements to ensure a sound, scientifically credible, and clinically valuable contribution beyond currently saturated competitive approaches in this domain of multimodal medical LLM explainability evaluation protocols, which hinges critically on the mechanism clarity and clinical adaptation rigor upfront for trustworthiness and replicability claims to hold merit and influence in the medical AI community and practice effectively as aimed here in your project vision and title claims.  This recommended enhancement addresses the major structural weakness in your proposal that otherwise risks reducing the contributionâ€™s significance and likelihood of successful impact and acceptance in top venues or clinical community adoption contexts by reinforcing its foundational theoretical and algorithmic basis first and foremost, enabling a clear pathway from technical method through experimental validation to clinical utility demonstrated in your study plan more faithfully and convincingly, increasing proposal coherence, reliability, novelty realization, and ultimate translational value confidently needed for this vibrant, highly competitive, and impactful area you seek to advance effectively, rather than merely incremental or superficial extensions.]  Target this feedback primarily in the 'Proposed_Method' section for the detailed method mechanism clarity and robustness enhancements requested here in this critique to allow downstream stages to be meaningfully grounded and sequenced logically in your concept development and validation road map to optimize scientific soundness and success chances of this challenging yet high-impact research objective involving explainable clinical multimodal LLM deployment."

          "feedback_content": "Given the pre-screen novelty verdict as NOV-COMPETITIVE indicating that the idea is a new combination but in a highly competitive area with strong existing work on interpretability and multimodal models, I strongly recommend integrating domain knowledge structures such as knowledge graphs or concept bottleneck models into your explainability framework. Specifically, you could augment your explainability modules with clinically curated knowledge graphs representing medical entities and their relationships, allowing the evaluation protocol to assess not only alignment of attention with image regions and text tokens but also the semantic grounding and consistency of explanations with established clinical concepts and causal pathways. Similarly, concept bottleneck models could be used as surrogate interpretable modules within your multimodal LLM system to provide concept-level explanations validated against clinical ontologies for transparency and better replicability. Incorporating these globally-linked concepts would distinguish your evaluation protocol from purely data-driven, modality-centric attention or causal attribution approaches by embedding structured medical domain semantics in the explainability metrics and evaluation criteria. This would enhance scientific novelty and impact by bridging state-of-the-art multimodal explainability mechanisms with clinically meaningful, structured reasoning abstractions, addressing scarcity of annotated data by leveraging external knowledge and improving trust indicators with semantically rich explanations. Such integration would also support more robust and clinically interpretable replicability measures by grounding explanations in stable, concept-based representations directly relevant to clinical decision support tasks. This recommendation targets the overall conceptual framework and could guide refinement of both your Proposed_Method and Experiment_Plan sections to incorporate knowledge graph construction or alignment, concept bottleneck model training, and corresponding metric definitions within your multimodal explainability evaluation pipeline. Doing so can elevate the workâ€™s contribution beyond incremental combinations in the competitive space toward a novel and impactful clinical AI explainability protocol advance with demonstrated utility and interpretability leverage leveraging established clinical knowledge assets, making it more compelling for publication at top NLP or ML venues and more valuable for clinical adoption."
