    "title": "NeuroCognitive Memory Fidelity Metric for LLMs",
    "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluation metrics for LLM performance replicability lack alignment with human working memory dynamics, resulting in insufficient fidelity assessment of how well LLMs store and recall information during real-world use.",
    "Motivation": "Addresses the external gap connecting 'content analysis' and 'human-level performance' with cognitive neuroscience concepts of working memory. Novelty lies in fusing neurocognitive paradigms with explainability frameworks to create new interpretability metrics that quantify LLM memory fidelity in production environments.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Develop a neuro-inspired metric that models LLM internal state persistence similar to human working memory capacity and decay. Using state sequence analysis during inference, the method quantifies decay patterns, interference, and recall consistency, integrating this with post-hoc explainability tools to highlight memory strengths and weaknesses per input context dynamically.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Extend Transformer-based LLMs to log internal hidden state trajectories.\n2. Implement neuro-inspired fidelity metrics modeled on working memory constructs.\n3. Evaluate on datasets requiring multi-turn reasoning (e.g., conversational benchmarks).\n4. Compare with standard perplexity, BLEU, and faithfulness metrics.\n5. Test in real production-like pipelines with dynamic inputs evaluating memory drift.\n6. Conduct user studies to link metric output with perceived trust.",
    "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: A multi-turn dialogue requiring recall of user preferences.\nExpected Output: Memory fidelity score that identifies decay after 3 dialogue turns, with an explanation highlighting where memory loss is detected in hidden state representations.",
    "Fallback_Plan": "If fidelity metrics poorly correlate with LLM performance, pivot to analyzing attention weight distribution dynamics as alternative memory proxies. Additionally, consider expanding to multi-modal memory signals or incorporating reinforcement learning feedback for calibration."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed method outlines an intriguing neuro-inspired memory fidelity metric for LLMs but lacks sufficient detail on how human working memory capacity and decay mechanisms will be precisely modeled and quantitatively integrated with LLM hidden state trajectories. Clarify the modeling choices, mathematical formulations, and the interpretability framework's specifics, including how post-hoc explainability tools will concretely interact with the metric to identify memory strengths and weaknesses per input context. This will strengthen the soundness of the proposed approach and validate core assumptions about mapping human working memory onto LLM internal states effectively and meaningfully within the metric design framework, rather than conceptually or qualitatively alone. Consider adding preliminary formalizations or pilot study results to demonstrate feasibility of this key mechanism before full-scale experiments are begun, reducing conceptual ambiguity and potential risks of overfitting human memory concepts onto LLM behaviors without empirical rigor in their fusion. This clarity is critical to ensure the proposed metric truly measures memory fidelity rather than proxy signals or confounded variables like attention artifacts or representational similarity alone, thus improving the explanatory power and reliability of metric outcomes in real-world use cases like multi-turn dialogue recall as illustrated in your test example(s)."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty assessment as NOV-COMPETITIVE, and your motivation to fuse neurocognitive paradigms with explainability for LLM memory fidelity, consider expanding the project's interdisciplinary impact by integrating concepts from 'adaptive instructional systems' and 'automated essay evaluation' within educational AI contexts. This could involve tailoring the memory fidelity metric to assess and improve LLMs used in AI tutors or essay grading systems, where memory consistency and traceability of reasoning steps impact educational outcomes and user trust. Such integration aligns with 'enhance educational practices' and 'HCI International conference' venues, broadening your impact beyond pure model fidelity metrics to include human-centered AI in education, amplifying relevance and adoption. This also leverages insights from 'human-robot interaction' and 'inspired architecture' by positioning your metric as a tool for building more transparent, memory-aware autonomous agents that support learning and human interaction contexts robustly, thereby elevating potential citations and interdisciplinary collaborations around 'general intelligence' and 'artificial general intelligence' themes in tangible real-world deployments."
