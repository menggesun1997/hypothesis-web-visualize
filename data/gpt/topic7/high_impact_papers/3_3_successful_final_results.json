    "Problem_Statement": "No unified framework exists that spans technical fairness, regulatory compliance, and human-centric socio-cognitive evaluation to ensure bias-stable and trustworthy LLM deployments in real-world scenarios.",
    "Motivation": "Confronts Opportunity 3 by merging EU AI Act regulatory insights with model interpretability and cognitive-behavioral science to close deployment gaps, enabling replicable and accountable LLM use in practice.",
    "Proposed_Method": "Design an end-to-end deployment lifecycle pipeline incorporating modular components: (a) fairness-aware model training, (b) regulatory compliance audits using formal verification tools aligned with legal requirements, (c) socio-cognitive user studies and feedback loops measuring trust and perceived fairness. Integrate monitoring dashboards for continuous bias and compliance checks informed by real-time user interactions and cognitive metrics.",
    "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Define regulatory constraints from EU AI Act rulebooks. 2. Implement fairness-aware training on LLM models for target domains. 3.

        "title": "RegulAlign: A Modular, Globally-Informed Lifecycle Framework Unifying Fairness, Regulation, and Socio-Cognitive Evaluation with Closed-Loop Adaptation for Trustworthy LLM Deployment",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current approaches to trustworthy LLM deployment inadequately address the complexity of integrating technical fairness, multi-jurisdictional regulatory compliance, and rigorous socio-cognitive trust evaluation—resulting in fragmented solutions that lack lifecycle continuity, adaptive capabilities, and global relevance.",
        "Motivation": "Addressing the NOV-COMPETITIVE landscape requires a comprehensive framework that not only unifies fairness and compliance under evolving international AI governance (e.g., EU AI Act, IEEE P7000 series), but also embeds causal explainability linking fairness audits and user trust metrics. RegulAlign aims to fill this gap by delivering a modular, interoperable lifecycle supporting iterative validation and adaptive retraining. This approach fosters replicable, accountable, and globally adaptable LLM deployments capable of maintaining trustworthiness across diverse regulatory and socio-technical contexts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "RegulAlign introduces a staged, modular lifecycle framework comprising: (a) fairness-aware pretraining and fine-tuning with well-defined measurable objectives at each stage; (b) a compliance auditing module integrating formal verification aligned with EU AI Act and internationally recognized standards like IEEE P7000, featuring clearly specified interfaces for tool interoperability; (c) a socio-cognitive evaluation pipeline utilizing rigorously developed synthetic socio-cognitive benchmarks for initial simulation, followed by validated longitudinal user studies with standardized trust metrics; (d) a causal explainability engine that correlates fairness metrics and socio-cognitive trust signals to identify bias sources and inform targeted adaptive retraining; and (e) continuous monitoring dashboards supporting real-time closed-loop feedback to retrain models responsively. Each module is designed for incremental deployment and integration via standardized interoperability protocols, ensuring flexible adoption aligned with practitioner resources and domain needs.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Decompose the lifecycle into discrete phases with clear milestones: fairness training validation, compliance audit tool prototyping, socio-cognitive simulation benchmark development, causal explainability proof-of-concept, and integration testing.\n2. Develop and validate synthetic socio-cognitive benchmark datasets to enable ethical and practical early-stage testing.\n3. Construct formal verification tools aligned with EU AI Act and IEEE P7000 requirements, with well-defined APIs promoting interoperability.\n4. Execute pilot fairness-aware training experiments measuring key metrics in target domains.\n5. Conduct controlled longitudinal user studies assessing trust, cognitive load, and perceived fairness using validated metrics.\n6. Implement causal analysis frameworks linking fairness and trust outputs; test adaptive retraining procedures based on identified causal links.\n7. Integrate modules incrementally, applying standardized interfaces; evaluate the pipeline end-to-end in simulated deployment environments.\n8. Iterate improvements informed by ongoing monitoring dashboards capturing real-time performance, fairness, compliance, and trust indicators.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Deployment of an LLM-powered hiring assistant in an EU country and a multinational financial advice chatbot requiring compliance with EU AI Act and IEEE P7000 standards. Expected outcomes include: (i) sustained fairness metrics within defined regulatory bounds, (ii) formal compliance certification documented by integrated audit tools, (iii) high user trust supported by longitudinal cognitive-behavioral assessments and socio-cognitive benchmark simulation results, (iv) demonstrated closed-loop adaptation triggered by integrated causal explainability analytics resulting in measurable bias mitigation and trust preservation.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If full end-to-end integration faces feasibility constraints, employ a modular adoption strategy leveraging well-defined interoperability standards (e.g., API specifications, data schemas) enabling practitioners to adopt components incrementally. Prioritize full validation of each major module independently—using synthetic socio-cognitive benchmarks for initial trust evaluation and formal verification tools with openly accessible interfaces—facilitating independent maturation. Utilize synthetic socio-cognitive simulations extensively to reduce ethical and logistical barriers prior to live user studies, thereby enabling steady progress while minimizing risks before large-scale deployment."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan is ambitious and spans multiple interdisciplinary areas (fairness training, legal formal verification, cognitive user studies). However, it lacks detailed operationalization in critical aspects—specifically, how formal verification tools will be concretely designed and integrated with model fairness auditing, and how socio-cognitive trust metrics will be reliably quantified and validated longitudinally. This raises concerns about the practical feasibility of simultaneous end-to-end evaluation. It is recommended to clearly decompose complex components into smaller, iterative milestones with defined measurable objectives, and to provide preliminary pilot studies demonstrating early proof-of-concept for each major component before full lifecycle integration. This will improve scientific rigor and realistic deployment expectations without compromising ambition or interdisciplinarity.\n\nAdditionally, the fallback plan to modularize is sound but should be expanded to specify interfaces and standards for interoperability to facilitate incremental adoption by practitioners with varying resource availability and domain constraints. Consider developing synthetic benchmarks for socio-cognitive simulation rigorously before real user studies to mitigate ethical and logistic challenges upfront, which is currently under-addressed in the plan.\n\nHence, without concrete clarification and staged validation, the feasibility of the overall experiment plan remains a major risk factor for success and credibility of the proposed framework."

          "feedback_content": "Given the novelty verdict of NOV-COMPETITIVE and absence of globally linked concepts, a clear path to differentiate RegulAlign is crucial. To enhance impact and novelty, explicitly integrate emerging AI governance frameworks and standards beyond the EU AI Act, such as IEEE’s P7000 series on ethically aligned design or similar international guidelines, to establish a globally relevant compliance baseline. \n\nMoreover, propose embedding causal analysis techniques or explainability frameworks that link fairness audits and socio-cognitive trust signals, creating a closed-loop system that not only evaluates but also guides adaptative model retraining based on real-time metrics. \n\nThis global integration can position RegulAlign as a modular, adaptable lifecycle framework interoperable across jurisdictions and evolving regulations, giving it distinct advantage and higher impact in a crowded field. The authors should elaborate such integration designs and novel methodological connections as part of a future research agenda or roadmap section to increase competitive edge and practical uptake."
