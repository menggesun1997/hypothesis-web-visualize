        "title": "Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Trust-Adapted Metrics for Continuous Evaluation of LLMs in Clinical Decision Support",
        "Problem_Statement": "Current evaluation metrics for large language models (LLMs) in clinical domains insufficiently address trustworthiness and domain-specific nuances critical for accurate, replicable clinical decision support. Moreover, existing approaches lack dynamic integration of clinician feedback and operational mechanisms for continuous trust-driven adaptation.",
        "Motivation": "While prior work has proposed composite trust metrics integrating factual accuracy, uncertainty, and fairness, they often remain conceptual and underexplored in practical iterative clinical workflows. Our approach distinguishes itself by embedding clinical knowledge graphs to structure evidence and decision rationales, enabling richer explanation completeness and interpretability of trust scores. This novel fusion enables transparent, context-sensitive evaluation and continuous model adaptation informed by real-time clinician input, advancing beyond static metrics towards a dynamic, system-integrated AI evaluation paradigm that better captures replicability and trust in sensitive healthcare contexts.",
        "Proposed_Method": "We propose a multi-component framework incorporating: (1) A dynamically maintained clinical knowledge graph encoding patient data, clinical guidelines, evidence sources, and decision rationales that enrich evaluation context and support traceability; (2) Composite trust metrics combining factual accuracy, uncertainty quantification, fairness, and explanation completeness, each informed and weighted via knowledge graph features; (3) An AI agent interface interacting with the knowledge graph and LLM outputs to provide interpretable trust scores to clinicians; (4) Quantitative integration of clinician feedback through structured surveys and interaction logs to iteratively recalibrate metric weighting within a continuous learning pipeline; (5) Development of feedback loops where trust-adapted metrics guide fine-tuning cycles of LLMs, maintaining auditability and adaptation transparency. This integration of knowledge graphs and AI agents elevates the novelty and practicality of trust evaluation, providing a scalable, interpretable system tailored for high-stakes clinical decision support.",
        "Step_by_Step_Experiment_Plan": "1. Conduct comprehensive review of clinical evaluation standards and existing trust metrics.\n2. Design and implement a clinical knowledge graph capturing structured evidence, guidelines, and decision rationales relevant to targeted clinical tasks.\n3. Define composite trust metric schema leveraging knowledge graph features for factual accuracy, uncertainty, fairness, and explanation completeness components.\n4. Select and preprocess diverse, de-identified clinical datasets for training and rigorous evaluation, implementing strict validation protocols to prevent data leakage and bias.\n5. Fine-tune LLMs on selected clinical tasks (Q&A, diagnosis), integrating knowledge graph context.\n6. Pilot deployment of trust metrics with a small cohort of clinicians using AI agent dashboards, collecting structured quantitative feedback and interaction logs.\n7. Analyze clinician feedback to recalibrate metric weighting algorithmically, employing statistical models for continuous metric adaptation.\n8. Iterate LLM fine-tuning and metric adjustment cycles driven by updated trust evaluations.\n9. Define and apply clear measurable criteria at each phase, including replicability (performance variance across datasets), trust score improvements, clinician trust survey scores, and explanation quality metrics.\n10. Scale pilot to larger clinical settings for validation and robustness testing.",
        "Test_Case_Examples": "Input: Complex, ambiguous patient presentation with conflicting symptoms and history.\nExpected Output: A detailed trust score comprising sub-scores for factual accuracy (validated against knowledge graph evidence), uncertainty quantification (confidence intervals contextualized with clinical knowledge), fairness indicators (checking for demographic biases), and explanation completeness (transparent derivation via knowledge graph links). The AI agent dashboard presents this to clinicians with interactive justification trails and allows structured feedback collection to inform metric recalibration.",
        "Fallback_Plan": "If operational complexity of integrated knowledge graph and AI agent system proves prohibitive initially, fallback involves deploying a simplified version focusing on calibrated confidence intervals paired with rule-based fairness and explanation completeness checks. Clinician trust and replicability will be estimated through structured proxy surveys and batch offline evaluations. This phased approach enables demonstration of incremental benefits and feasibility before full system integration."

          "feedback_content": "The proposed step-by-step experimental plan outlines relevant steps but lacks clarity on how metric-driven feedback loops will practically be implemented and evaluated in clinical LLM updates. More concrete methodology is needed for integrating clinician feedback quantitatively into metric weighting and continuous learning cycles to ensure feasibility. Additionally, the plan would benefit from specifying measurable criteria or success thresholds at each stage to track progress rigorously, especially for replicability and trust improvements in real workflows, which are challenging to quantify in practice. Clarification on dataset selection and validation protocols to avoid bias and data leakage would strengthen feasibility assessment as well. Consider piloting early iterations of the metric framework to identify integration challenges before full-scale deployment to address operational complexity risks early on in the timeline, improving scientific rigor and practical feasibility of the evaluation and adaptation loops proposed in the method section. This will significantly bolster confidence that the methodology can be realized and yield actionable results in sensitive clinical domains during subsequent experimental phases. The current description risks being too conceptual without these important practical details and validation criteria incorporated into the experiment plan documentation and design.

          "feedback_content": "Given the competitive novelty rating, enhancing the idea's distinctiveness by integrating knowledge graph techniques into the trust-adapted evaluation framework could be highly beneficial. For instance, structuring clinical knowledge, evidence sources, and decision rationales as a dynamic knowledge graph could enrich the explanation completeness and factual accuracy components of the composite metric. This would also facilitate traceability and provide richer context for uncertainty quantification and fairness assessments, making trust scores more transparent and interpretable to clinicians. Additionally, leveraging AI tools and agents that can interact with this knowledge graph to dynamically adjust trust metrics based on evolving clinical guidelines or patient contexts may increase impact and differentiation from existing evaluation methodologies. This approach aligns with the broader global concepts of AI tools, knowledge graphs, and information systems engineering, extending the contribution beyond metric design toward integrated AI-enabled clinical decision support evaluation. Introducing this integration as an optional or advanced phase could help differentiate the research idea in a crowded space and address the challenge of replicability and trustworthiness with a systems-level innovation.
